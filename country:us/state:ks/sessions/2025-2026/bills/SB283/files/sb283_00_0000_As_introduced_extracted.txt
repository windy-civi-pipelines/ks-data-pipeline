9 50,211, and amendments thereto, and also meets the definition of a
10 business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(b), and amendments thereto, shall be
11 allowed a credit for such investment, in an amount determined under
12 subsection (b) or (c), as the case requires, against the tax imposed by the
13 Kansas income tax act or where the qualified business facility is the
14 principal place from which the trade or business of the taxpayer is directed
15 or managed and the facility has facilitated the creation of at least 20 new
16 full-time positions, against the premium tax or privilege fees imposed
17 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or as measured by the

19 chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, for
20 the taxable year during which commencement of commercial operations,
21 as defined in K.S.A. 79-32,154(f), and amendments thereto, occurs at such
22 qualified business facility. In the case of a taxpayer who meets the
23 definition of a manufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(d), and
24 amendments thereto, no credit shall be allowed under this section unless
25 the number of qualified business facility employees, as determined under
26 K.S.A. 79-32,154(d), and amendments thereto, engaged or maintained in
27 employment at the qualified business facility as a direct result of the
28 investment by the taxpayer for the taxable year for which the credit is
29 claimed equals or exceeds two. In the case of a taxpayer who meets the

34 employment at the qualified business facility as a direct result of the
35 investment by the taxpayer for the taxable year for which the credit is
36 claimed equals or exceeds five. Where an employee performs services for
37 the taxpayer outside the qualified business facility, the employee shall be
38 considered engaged or maintained in employment at the qualified business
39 facility if: (1) The employee's service performed outside the qualified
40 business facility is incidental to the employee's service inside the qualified
41 business facility; or (2) the base of operations or, the place from which the
42 service is directed or controlled, is at the qualified business facility.

9 Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year for which such
10 credit is allowed, but in the case where the qualified business facility
11 investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, not in excess of 50% of
12 such tax. Such portion shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
13 following:
14 (1) $2,500 for each qualified business facility employee determined
15 under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto; plus

17 be deemed to be 51% or more, in qualified business facility investment, as
18 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto.
19 (c) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for any taxpayer who invests
20 in a qualified business facility that is not located in a nonmetropolitan
21 region established under K.S.A. 74-50,116, and amendments thereto, and
22 effective for tax years commencing after December 31, 2010, and before
23 January 1, 2012, located in an area other than a metropolitan county as
24 defined in either K.S.A. 74-50,114 or 74-50,211, and amendments thereto,
25 and that also meets the definition of business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(b), and
26 amendments thereto, on or after the effective date of this act, shall be a
27 portion of the income tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the
28 taxpayer's Kansas taxable income, the premium tax or privilege fees
29 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the
30 privilege tax as measured by the net income of financial institutions
31 imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
32 Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year for which such
33 credit is allowed, but in the case where the qualified business facility
34 investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, not in excess of 50% of
35 such tax. Such portion shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
36 following:
37 (1) $1,500 for each qualified business facility employee as
38 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto; and
39 (2) $1,000 for each $100,000, or major fraction thereof, which shall
40 be deemed to be 51% or more, in qualified business facility investment as
41 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto.
42 (d) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for each qualified business
43 facility employee and for qualified business facility investment shall be a
SB 283 12
1 one-time credit. If the amount of the credit allowed under subsection (a)
2 exceeds the tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the taxpayer's
3 Kansas taxable income, the premium tax and privilege fees imposed
4 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
5 measured by the net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
6 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
7 thereto, for the taxable year, or in the case where the qualified business
8 facility investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, 50% of such tax
9 imposed upon the amount which exceeds such tax liability or such portion
10 thereof may be carried over for credit in the same manner in the
11 succeeding taxable years until the total amount of such credit is used.
12 Except that, before the credit is allowed, a taxpayer, who meets the
13 definition of a manufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(d), and
14 amendments thereto, shall recertify annually that the net increase of a
15 minimum of two qualified business facility employees has continued to be
16 maintained and a taxpayer, who meets the definition of a
17 nonmanufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(f), and amendments
18 thereto, shall recertify annually that the net increase of a minimum of five
19 qualified business employees has continued to be maintained.
20 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, and
21 except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any taxpayer qualified and
22 certified under the provisions of K.S.A. 74-50,131, and amendments
23 thereto, that prior to making a commitment to invest in a qualified Kansas
24 business, has filed a certificate of intent to invest in a qualified business
25 facility in a form satisfactory to the secretary of commerce, shall be
26 entitled to a credit in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the
27 qualified business facility investment that exceeds $50,000 in lieu of the
28 credit provided in subsection (b)(2) or (c)(2) without regard to the number
29 of qualified business facility employees engaged or maintained in
30 employment at the qualified business facility. For tax years beginning on
31 or after January 1, 2012, for a qualified business facility investment in
32 Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee or Wyandotte county, such credit
33 shall be in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the qualified business
34 facility investment that exceeds $1,000,000. Any taxpayer who has filed a
35 certificate of intent to invest in a qualified business facility pursuant to this
36 subsection in Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee or Wyandotte county
37 prior to December 31, 2011, and commences investments in a qualified
38 business facility prior to December 31, 2013, may claim credits under
39 K.S.A. 74-50,131, 74-50,132 and 79-32,160a(e), and amendments thereto,
40 in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the qualified business facility
41 investment that exceeds $50,000. Timing modifications may be authorized
42 at the discretion of the secretary of commerce and the secretary of revenue
43 during the transition period. The credit allowed by this subsection shall be
SB 283 13
1 a one-time credit. If the amount thereof exceeds the tax imposed by the
2 Kansas income tax act on the taxpayer's Kansas taxable income or the
3 premium tax or privilege fees imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and
4 amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as measured by net income of
5 financial institutions imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the
6 Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year,
7 the amount thereof that exceeds such tax liability may be carried forward
8 for credit in the succeeding taxable year or years until the total amount of
9 the tax credit is used, except that no such tax credit shall be carried
10 forward for deduction after the 16th taxable year succeeding the taxable
11 year in which such credit initially was claimed, and no carryforward shall
12 be allowed for deduction in any succeeding taxable year unless the
13 taxpayer certifies under oath that the taxpayer continues to meet the
14 requirements of K.S.A. 74-50,131, and amendments thereto, and this act.
15 In no event shall any credit allowed under this section that expired during
16 any taxable year prior to the taxable year commencing January 1, 2011, be
17 revived under the provisions of this act. No tax credit shall be allowed
18 pursuant to this subsection for tax years commencing after December 31,
19 2025, except that for taxpayers who have excess unused credit pursuant to
20 a credit initially claimed under this subsection for a tax year commencing
21 before January 1, 2026, the credit carryforward provisions of this
22 subsection still apply.
23 (f) For projects placed into service on and after January 1, 2021, a
24 taxpayer may transfer up to 50% of the tax credit allowed under subsection
25 (e), as provided in this subsection. The taxpayer may make a transfer to
26 one or more transferees, but the total of all transfers shall not exceed 50%
27 of the taxpayer's tax credit. The taxpayer shall make the transfer or
28 transfers within a single tax year. The credit may be transferred to any
29 individual or entity and shall be claimed in the year the credit was
30 transferred against the transferee's tax liability for the income tax under the
31 Kansas income tax act or the premium tax or privilege fees imposed
32 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
33 measured by the net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
34 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
35 thereto. The amount of the credit that exceeds the transferee's tax liability
36 for such year may be carried forward for credit in the succeeding taxable
37 year or years until the total amount of the tax credit is used, except that no
38 such credit shall be carried forward for deduction after the 16th taxable
39 year succeeding the taxable year in which such credit was initially
40 claimed. The taxpayer or transferee shall provide such documentation of
41 the tax credit transfer to the secretary of revenue as may be required by the
42 secretary. No transfer of credits shall be allowed pursuant to this
43 subsection after December 31, 2025. The credit carryforward provisions
SB 283 14
1 of this subsection still apply for transferees who have excess unused credit
2 pursuant to a transfer that occurred before January 1, 2026.
3 (g) In the event the tax credit earned by the taxpayer and transferred
4 to a transferee is later disallowed in whole or in part by the secretary of
5 revenue, the taxpayer that originally earned the tax credit shall be liable for
6 repayment to the state in the amount disallowed.
7 (h) For tax years commencing after December 31, 2005, Any
8 taxpayer claiming credits pursuant to this section, as a condition for
9 claiming and qualifying for such credits, shall provide information
10 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,243, and amendments thereto, as part of the tax
11 return in which such credits are claimed. Such credits shall not be denied
12 solely on the basis of the contents of the information provided by the
13 taxpayer pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,243, and amendments thereto.
14 (i) This section and K.S.A. 79-32,160b, and amendments thereto,
15 shall be a part of and supplemental to the job expansion and investment
16 credit act of 1976, and amendments thereto.
17 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,306 is hereby amended to read as
18 follows: 79-32,306. (a) For all taxable years commencing after December
19 31, 2022, and ending as provided in subsection (i), there shall be allowed a
20 credit against the income tax liability imposed pursuant to the Kansas
21 income tax act, the privilege tax liability imposed upon any national
22 banking association, state bank, trust company or savings and loan
23 association pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
24 Annotated, and amendments thereto, or the premium tax liability imposed
25 upon an insurance company pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments
26 thereto, for each qualified development for each year of the credit period,
27 in an amount equal to the federal tax credit allocated or allowed by the
28 KHRC to such qualified development, except that there shall be no
29 reduction in the credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to
30 the calculation in section 42(f)(2) of the federal internal revenue code.
31 (b) The KHRC shall issue an allocation certificate to an owner of a
32 qualified development to which a credit has been allocated. The KHRC
33 shall issue an allocation certificate to the qualified development
34 simultaneously with issuance of federal form 8609 with respect to the
35 federal tax credits.
36 (c) All allocations shall be made pursuant to the qualified allocation
37 plan.
38 (d) If an owner of a qualified development receiving an allocation of
39 a credit is a pass-through entity, the owner may allocate the credit among
40 its partners or members in any manner agreed to by such persons
41 regardless of whether: (1) Any such person is allocated or allowed any
42 portion of any federal tax credit with respect to the qualified project; (2)
43 the allocation of the credit under the terms of the agreement has substantial
SB 283 15
1 economic effect within the meaning of section 704(b) of the federal
2 internal revenue code; or (3) any such person is deemed a partner for
3 federal income tax purposes, if the partner or member would be considered
4 a partner or member under applicable state law governing such entity and
5 has been admitted as a partner or member on or prior to the date for filing
6 the qualified taxpayer's tax return, including any amendments to such tax
7 return, with respect to the year of the credit. In the case of multiple tiers of
8 pass-through entities, the credit may be so allocated through any number
9 of pass-through entities in any manner agreed by the owners of such pass-
10 through entities, none of which shall be considered a transfer. Any pass-
11 through entity allocating a credit to its partners or members shall attach a
12 pass-through certification to its tax return annually. Each partner or
13 member shall be allowed to claim or further allocate such amount subject
14 to any restrictions set forth in this act.
15 (e) An owner of a qualified development to which a credit has been
16 allocated and each qualified taxpayer to which such owner has allocated a
17 portion of such credit, if any, shall file with their state income, privilege or
18 premium tax return a copy of the allocation certificate issued by the
19 KHRC with respect to such qualified development and a copy of any pass-
20 through certification, as prescribed by the director.
21 (f) No credit shall be allocated pursuant to this act unless the qualified
22 development is the subject of a recorded restrictive covenant requiring the
23 development to be maintained and operated as a qualified development
24 and is in accordance with the accessibility and adaptability requirements of
25 the federal tax credits and title VIII of the civil rights act of 1968, as
26 amended by the fair housing amendments act of 1988, for a period of 15
27 taxable years, or such longer period as may be agreed to between the
28 KHRC and the owner of the qualified development, beginning with the
29 first taxable year of the credit period.
30 (g) The allocated credit amount may be taken against the income,
31 privilege or premium taxes imposed for each taxable year of the credit
32 period. Any amount of credit that exceeds the income, privilege or
33 premium tax liability of a qualified taxpayer for a taxable year may be
34 carried forward as a credit against subsequent years' tax liability up to 11
35 tax years following the tax year in which the allocation was made and shall
36 be applied first to the earliest years possible. Any amount of the credit that
37 is not used shall not be refunded to the taxpayer.
38 (h) Unless otherwise provided in this act or the context or law
39 requires otherwise, the KHRC shall determine eligibility for a credit and
40 allocate credits in accordance with the standards and requirements set forth
41 in section 42 of the federal internal revenue code. Any combination of
42 federal tax credits and credits allowed pursuant to this act shall be the least
43 amount necessary to ensure the financial feasibility of a qualified
SB 283 16
1 development.
2 (i) The provisions of the Kansas affordable housing tax credit act,
3 K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,304 through 79-32,309, and amendments thereto,
4 shall be discontinued on April 1, 2025, except that such provisions shall
5 continue to apply through the credit period, and any applicable carry
6 forward period, of a Kansas affordable housing tax credit allocation
7 awarded to the owner of a qualified development by the KHRC before
8 April 1, 2025. No applications to the KHRC approved on or after April 1,
9 2025, shall be eligible to receive a state tax credit under the provisions of
10 this act. No credit shall be allocated or awarded under this act after
11 March 31, 2025. No credit shall be allowed pursuant to this section for tax
12 years commencing after December 31, 2025, except as provided in this
13 subsection for credits allocated or awarded before April 1, 2025.
14 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 74-50,132, 74-50,212 and 74-50,213 and K.S.A. 2024
15 Supp. 74-50,107, 79-32,110, 79-32,160a and 79-32,306 are hereby
16 repealed.
17 Sec. 10. On and after January 1, 2026, K.S.A. 65-7107, 79-32,204,
18 79-32,207, 79-32,222, 79-32,262 and 79-32,266 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp.
19 32-1438 are hereby repealed.

34 employment at the qualified business facility as a direct result of the
35 investment by the taxpayer for the taxable year for which the credit is
36 claimed equals or exceeds five. Where an employee performs services for
37 the taxpayer outside the qualified business facility, the employee shall be
38 considered engaged or maintained in employment at the qualified business
39 facility if: (1) The employee's service performed outside the qualified
40 business facility is incidental to the employee's service inside the qualified
41 business facility; or (2) the base of operations or, the place from which the
42 service is directed or controlled, is at the qualified business facility.
43 (b) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for any taxpayer who invests

SB 283 11
1 in a qualified business facility that is located in a designated
2 nonmetropolitan region established under K.S.A. 74-50,116, and
3 amendments thereto, on or after the effective date of this act, shall be a
4 portion of the income tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the
5 taxpayer's Kansas taxable income, the premium tax or privilege fees
6 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the
7 privilege tax as measured by the net income of financial institutions
8 imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
9 Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year for which such
10 credit is allowed, but in the case where the qualified business facility
11 investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, not in excess of 50% of
12 such tax. Such portion shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
13 following:
14 (1) $2,500 for each qualified business facility employee determined
15 under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto; plus
16 (2) $1,000 for each $100,000, or major fraction thereof, which shall
17 be deemed to be 51% or more, in qualified business facility investment, as
18 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto.
19 (c) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for any taxpayer who invests
20 in a qualified business facility that is not located in a nonmetropolitan
21 region established under K.S.A. 74-50,116, and amendments thereto, and
22 effective for tax years commencing after December 31, 2010, and before
23 January 1, 2012, located in an area other than a metropolitan county as
24 defined in either K.S.A. 74-50,114 or 74-50,211, and amendments thereto,
25 and that also meets the definition of business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(b), and
26 amendments thereto, on or after the effective date of this act, shall be a
27 portion of the income tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the
28 taxpayer's Kansas taxable income, the premium tax or privilege fees
29 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the
30 privilege tax as measured by the net income of financial institutions
31 imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
32 Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year for which such
33 credit is allowed, but in the case where the qualified business facility
34 investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, not in excess of 50% of
35 such tax. Such portion shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
36 following:
37 (1) $1,500 for each qualified business facility employee as
38 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto; and
39 (2) $1,000 for each $100,000, or major fraction thereof, which shall
40 be deemed to be 51% or more, in qualified business facility investment as
41 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto.
42 (d) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for each qualified business
43 facility employee and for qualified business facility investment shall be a

SB 283 12
1 one-time credit. If the amount of the credit allowed under subsection (a)
2 exceeds the tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the taxpayer's
3 Kansas taxable income, the premium tax and privilege fees imposed
4 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
5 measured by the net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
6 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
7 thereto, for the taxable year, or in the case where the qualified business
8 facility investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, 50% of such tax
9 imposed upon the amount which exceeds such tax liability or such portion
10 thereof may be carried over for credit in the same manner in the
11 succeeding taxable years until the total amount of such credit is used.
12 Except that, before the credit is allowed, a taxpayer, who meets the
13 definition of a manufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(d), and
14 amendments thereto, shall recertify annually that the net increase of a
15 minimum of two qualified business facility employees has continued to be
16 maintained and a taxpayer, who meets the definition of a
17 nonmanufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(f), and amendments
18 thereto, shall recertify annually that the net increase of a minimum of five
19 qualified business employees has continued to be maintained.
20 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, and
21 except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any taxpayer qualified and
22 certified under the provisions of K.S.A. 74-50,131, and amendments
23 thereto, that prior to making a commitment to invest in a qualified Kansas
24 business, has filed a certificate of intent to invest in a qualified business
25 facility in a form satisfactory to the secretary of commerce, shall be
26 entitled to a credit in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the
27 qualified business facility investment that exceeds $50,000 in lieu of the
28 credit provided in subsection (b)(2) or (c)(2) without regard to the number
29 of qualified business facility employees engaged or maintained in
30 employment at the qualified business facility. For tax years beginning on
31 or after January 1, 2012, for a qualified business facility investment in
32 Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee or Wyandotte county, such credit
33 shall be in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the qualified business
34 facility investment that exceeds $1,000,000. Any taxpayer who has filed a
35 certificate of intent to invest in a qualified business facility pursuant to this
36 subsection in Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee or Wyandotte county
37 prior to December 31, 2011, and commences investments in a qualified
38 business facility prior to December 31, 2013, may claim credits under
39 K.S.A. 74-50,131, 74-50,132 and 79-32,160a(e), and amendments thereto,
40 in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the qualified business facility
41 investment that exceeds $50,000. Timing modifications may be authorized
42 at the discretion of the secretary of commerce and the secretary of revenue
43 during the transition period. The credit allowed by this subsection shall be

SB 283 13
1 a one-time credit. If the amount thereof exceeds the tax imposed by the
2 Kansas income tax act on the taxpayer's Kansas taxable income or the
3 premium tax or privilege fees imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and
4 amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as measured by net income of
5 financial institutions imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the
6 Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year,
7 the amount thereof that exceeds such tax liability may be carried forward
8 for credit in the succeeding taxable year or years until the total amount of
9 the tax credit is used, except that no such tax credit shall be carried
10 forward for deduction after the 16th taxable year succeeding the taxable
11 year in which such credit initially was claimed, and no carryforward shall
12 be allowed for deduction in any succeeding taxable year unless the
13 taxpayer certifies under oath that the taxpayer continues to meet the
14 requirements of K.S.A. 74-50,131, and amendments thereto, and this act.
15 In no event shall any credit allowed under this section that expired during
16 any taxable year prior to the taxable year commencing January 1, 2011, be
17 revived under the provisions of this act. No tax credit shall be allowed
18 pursuant to this subsection for tax years commencing after December 31,
19 2025, except that for taxpayers who have excess unused credit pursuant to
20 a credit initially claimed under this subsection for a tax year commencing
21 before January 1, 2026, the credit carryforward provisions of this
22 subsection still apply.
23 (f) For projects placed into service on and after January 1, 2021, a
24 taxpayer may transfer up to 50% of the tax credit allowed under subsection
25 (e), as provided in this subsection. The taxpayer may make a transfer to
26 one or more transferees, but the total of all transfers shall not exceed 50%
27 of the taxpayer's tax credit. The taxpayer shall make the transfer or
28 transfers within a single tax year. The credit may be transferred to any
29 individual or entity and shall be claimed in the year the credit was
30 transferred against the transferee's tax liability for the income tax under the
31 Kansas income tax act or the premium tax or privilege fees imposed
32 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
33 measured by the net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
34 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
35 thereto. The amount of the credit that exceeds the transferee's tax liability
36 for such year may be carried forward for credit in the succeeding taxable
37 year or years until the total amount of the tax credit is used, except that no
38 such credit shall be carried forward for deduction after the 16th taxable
39 year succeeding the taxable year in which such credit was initially
40 claimed. The taxpayer or transferee shall provide such documentation of
41 the tax credit transfer to the secretary of revenue as may be required by the
42 secretary. No transfer of credits shall be allowed pursuant to this
43 subsection after December 31, 2025. The credit carryforward provisions

SB 283 14
1 of this subsection still apply for transferees who have excess unused credit
2 pursuant to a transfer that occurred before January 1, 2026.
3 (g) In the event the tax credit earned by the taxpayer and transferred
4 to a transferee is later disallowed in whole or in part by the secretary of
5 revenue, the taxpayer that originally earned the tax credit shall be liable for
6 repayment to the state in the amount disallowed.
7 (h) For tax years commencing after December 31, 2005, Any
8 taxpayer claiming credits pursuant to this section, as a condition for
9 claiming and qualifying for such credits, shall provide information
10 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,243, and amendments thereto, as part of the tax
11 return in which such credits are claimed. Such credits shall not be denied
12 solely on the basis of the contents of the information provided by the
13 taxpayer pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,243, and amendments thereto.
14 (i) This section and K.S.A. 79-32,160b, and amendments thereto,
15 shall be a part of and supplemental to the job expansion and investment
16 credit act of 1976, and amendments thereto.
17 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,306 is hereby amended to read as
18 follows: 79-32,306. (a) For all taxable years commencing after December
19 31, 2022, and ending as provided in subsection (i), there shall be allowed a
20 credit against the income tax liability imposed pursuant to the Kansas
21 income tax act, the privilege tax liability imposed upon any national
22 banking association, state bank, trust company or savings and loan
23 association pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
24 Annotated, and amendments thereto, or the premium tax liability imposed
25 upon an insurance company pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments
26 thereto, for each qualified development for each year of the credit period,
27 in an amount equal to the federal tax credit allocated or allowed by the
28 KHRC to such qualified development, except that there shall be no
29 reduction in the credit allowable in the first year of the credit period due to
30 the calculation in section 42(f)(2) of the federal internal revenue code.
31 (b) The KHRC shall issue an allocation certificate to an owner of a
32 qualified development to which a credit has been allocated. The KHRC
33 shall issue an allocation certificate to the qualified development
34 simultaneously with issuance of federal form 8609 with respect to the
35 federal tax credits.
36 (c) All allocations shall be made pursuant to the qualified allocation
37 plan.
38 (d) If an owner of a qualified development receiving an allocation of
39 a credit is a pass-through entity, the owner may allocate the credit among
40 its partners or members in any manner agreed to by such persons
41 regardless of whether: (1) Any such person is allocated or allowed any
42 portion of any federal tax credit with respect to the qualified project; (2)
43 the allocation of the credit under the terms of the agreement has substantial

SB 283 15
1 economic effect within the meaning of section 704(b) of the federal
2 internal revenue code; or (3) any such person is deemed a partner for
3 federal income tax purposes, if the partner or member would be considered
4 a partner or member under applicable state law governing such entity and
5 has been admitted as a partner or member on or prior to the date for filing
6 the qualified taxpayer's tax return, including any amendments to such tax
7 return, with respect to the year of the credit. In the case of multiple tiers of
8 pass-through entities, the credit may be so allocated through any number
9 of pass-through entities in any manner agreed by the owners of such pass-
10 through entities, none of which shall be considered a transfer. Any pass-
11 through entity allocating a credit to its partners or members shall attach a
12 pass-through certification to its tax return annually. Each partner or
13 member shall be allowed to claim or further allocate such amount subject
14 to any restrictions set forth in this act.
15 (e) An owner of a qualified development to which a credit has been
16 allocated and each qualified taxpayer to which such owner has allocated a
17 portion of such credit, if any, shall file with their state income, privilege or
18 premium tax return a copy of the allocation certificate issued by the
19 KHRC with respect to such qualified development and a copy of any pass-
20 through certification, as prescribed by the director.
21 (f) No credit shall be allocated pursuant to this act unless the qualified
22 development is the subject of a recorded restrictive covenant requiring the
23 development to be maintained and operated as a qualified development
24 and is in accordance with the accessibility and adaptability requirements of
25 the federal tax credits and title VIII of the civil rights act of 1968, as
26 amended by the fair housing amendments act of 1988, for a period of 15
27 taxable years, or such longer period as may be agreed to between the
28 KHRC and the owner of the qualified development, beginning with the
29 first taxable year of the credit period.
30 (g) The allocated credit amount may be taken against the income,
31 privilege or premium taxes imposed for each taxable year of the credit
32 period. Any amount of credit that exceeds the income, privilege or
33 premium tax liability of a qualified taxpayer for a taxable year may be
34 carried forward as a credit against subsequent years' tax liability up to 11
35 tax years following the tax year in which the allocation was made and shall
36 be applied first to the earliest years possible. Any amount of the credit that
37 is not used shall not be refunded to the taxpayer.
38 (h) Unless otherwise provided in this act or the context or law
39 requires otherwise, the KHRC shall determine eligibility for a credit and
40 allocate credits in accordance with the standards and requirements set forth
41 in section 42 of the federal internal revenue code. Any combination of
42 federal tax credits and credits allowed pursuant to this act shall be the least
43 amount necessary to ensure the financial feasibility of a qualified

SB 283 16
1 development.
2 (i) The provisions of the Kansas affordable housing tax credit act,
3 K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,304 through 79-32,309, and amendments thereto,
4 shall be discontinued on April 1, 2025, except that such provisions shall
5 continue to apply through the credit period, and any applicable carry
6 forward period, of a Kansas affordable housing tax credit allocation
7 awarded to the owner of a qualified development by the KHRC before
8 April 1, 2025. No applications to the KHRC approved on or after April 1,
9 2025, shall be eligible to receive a state tax credit under the provisions of
10 this act. No credit shall be allocated or awarded under this act after
11 March 31, 2025. No credit shall be allowed pursuant to this section for tax
12 years commencing after December 31, 2025, except as provided in this
13 subsection for credits allocated or awarded before April 1, 2025.
14 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 74-50,132, 74-50,212 and 74-50,213 and K.S.A. 2024
15 Supp. 74-50,107, 79-32,110, 79-32,160a and 79-32,306 are hereby
16 repealed.
17 Sec. 10. On and after January 1, 2026, K.S.A. 65-7107, 79-32,204,
18 79-32,207, 79-32,222, 79-32,262 and 79-32,266 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp.
