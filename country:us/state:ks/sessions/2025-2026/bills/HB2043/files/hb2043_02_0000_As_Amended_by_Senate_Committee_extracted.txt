24 disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before
25 the public, or knowingly causing directly or indirectly, to be made,
26 published, disseminated, circulated, delivered to any person, or placed

30 report or statement of any person or knowingly omitting to make a true
31 entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of such person in any

33 (6) Stock operations and advisory board contracts. Issuing or
34 delivering or permitting agents, officers or employees to issue or deliver,
35 agency company stock or other capital stock, or benefit certificates or
36 shares in any common-law corporation, or securities or any special or
37 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns
38 and profits as an inducement to insurance. Nothing herein shall prohibit
39 the acts permitted by K.S.A. 40-232, and amendments thereto.
40 (7) Unfair discrimination. (a) Making or permitting any unfair
41 discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation
42 of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or life annuity
43 or in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the
HB 2043—Am. by SC 3
1 terms and conditions of such contract.
2 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between
3 individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the
4 amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract
5 of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in
6 any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner
7 whatever.
8 (c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting

10 charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage solely
11 because of blindness or partial blindness. With respect to all other
12 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
13 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
14 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
15 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
16 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
17 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
18 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
19 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
20 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

25 losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based
26 on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or
27 may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
28 (d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined
29 in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto, between family members,
30 current or former household members, or current or former intimate
31 partners.
32 (i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health
33 insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may
34 be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek
35 medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse,
36 protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
37 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
38 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
39 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
40 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
41 insurance policy.
42 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
43 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
HB 2043—Am. by SC 4
1 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
2 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
3 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
4 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
5 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
6 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
7 based on sound actuarial principles.
8 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
9 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
10 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
11 provided that:
12 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
13 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
14 of abuse;
15 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
16 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
17 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
18 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
19 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
20 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
21 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
22 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
23 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
24 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
25 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
26 effective date of this act.
27 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
28 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
29 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
30 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
31 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
32 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
33 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
34 donors.
35 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
36 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
37 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to
38 such contract other than as plainly expressed in the insurance contract
39 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
40 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any
41 rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage
42 in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or
43 inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or giving, selling,
HB 2043—Am. by SC 5

2 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
3 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
4 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
5 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
6 (b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including
7 within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the following
8 practices:
9 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
10 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
11 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
12 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
13 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
14 policyholders;
15 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
16 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
17 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
18 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
19 expenses;
20 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
21 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
22 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be
23 made retroactive only for such policy year;
24 (iv) engaging in an arrangement that would not violate section 106 of
25 the bank holding company act amendments of 1972, as interpreted by the
26 board of governors of the federal reserve system or section 5(q) of the
27 home owners' loan act;
28 (v) the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through
29 employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
30 products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services
31 are not specified in the policy of insurance if the product or service:
32 (A) Relates to the insurance coverage; and
33 (B) is primarily designed to satisfy one or more of the following:

12 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
13 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with
14 questions regarding the product or service.
15 (E) The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations when
16 implementing the permitted practices set forth in this section to ensure

20 (F) The availability of the value-added product or service shall be
21 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
22 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
23 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
24 (G) (1) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
25 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
26 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
27 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
28 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall
29 notify the commissioner of such a pilot or testing program offered to
30 consumers in this state prior to launching and may proceed with the
31 program unless the commissioner objects within 21 days of notice.
32 (2) If the insurer or producer is unable to determine sufficient
33 evidence within the one-year pilot or testing period, the insurer or

42 commissioner per policy year per term. The offer shall be made in a
43 manner that is not unfairly discriminatory. The customer shall not be

1 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
2 for the gift, item or service.
3 (B) Conduct raffles or drawings to the extent permitted by state law,

9 The customer shall not be required to purchase, continue to purchase or

11 (c) An insurer, producer or representative of an insurer or producer
12 shall not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the purchase of
13 another policy.
14 (9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement
15 practice if any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining
16 thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such

36 finder's fee.

12 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
13 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
14 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title

32 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
33 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
34 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
35 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
36 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the

38 business or associate referring the title insurance business.

40 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any

13 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
14 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
15 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
16 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
17 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
18 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
19 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
20 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
21 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has

3 commissioner of insurance within 14 calendar days; authorizing certain
4 rebate pilot programs to exceed one year in duration; amending K.S.A.
5 2024 Supp. 40-2404 and 40-4909 and repealing the existing sections.
6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-2404 is hereby amended to read as
9 follows: 40-2404. The following are hereby defined as unfair methods of
10 competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of
11 insurance:
12 (1) Misrepresentations and false advertising of insurance policies.
13 Making, issuing, circulating or causing to be made, issued or circulated,
14 any estimate, illustration, circular, statement, sales presentation, omission
15 or comparison that:
16 (a) Misrepresents the benefits, advantages, conditions or terms of any
17 insurance policy;
18 (b) misrepresents the dividends or share of the surplus to be received
19 on any insurance policy;
20 (c) makes any false or misleading statements as to the dividends or
21 share of surplus previously paid on any insurance policy;
22 (d) is misleading or is a misrepresentation as to the financial
23 condition of any person, or as to the legal reserve system upon which any

29 insurance policy;
30 (g) is a misrepresentation for the purpose of effecting a pledge or
31 assignment of or effecting a loan against any insurance policy; or
32 (h) misrepresents any insurance policy as being shares of stock.
33 (2) False information and advertising generally. Making, publishing,

HB 2043—Am. by SC 2
1 disseminating, circulating or placing before the public, or causing, directly
2 or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated or placed
3 before the public, in a newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the
4 form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio or
5 television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement or
6 statement containing any assertion, misrepresentation or statement with
7 respect to the business of insurance or with respect to any person in the
8 conduct of such person's insurance business, that is untrue, deceptive or
9 misleading.
10 (3) Defamation. Making, publishing, disseminating or circulating,
11 directly or indirectly, or aiding, abetting or encouraging the making,
12 publishing, disseminating or circulating of any oral or written statement or
13 any pamphlet, circular, article or literature that is false, or maliciously
14 critical of or derogatory to the financial condition of any person, and that
15 is calculated to injure such person.
16 (4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement
17 to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott,
18 coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable
19 restraint of the business of insurance, or by any act of boycott, coercion or
20 intimidation monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of the
21 business of insurance.
22 (5) False statements and entries. (a) Knowingly filing with any
23 supervisory or other public official, or knowingly making, publishing,
24 disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before
25 the public, or knowingly causing directly or indirectly, to be made,
26 published, disseminated, circulated, delivered to any person, or placed
27 before the public, any false material statement of fact as to the financial
28 condition of a person.
29 (b) Knowingly making any false entry of a material fact in any book,
30 report or statement of any person or knowingly omitting to make a true
31 entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of such person in any
32 book, report or statement of such person.
33 (6) Stock operations and advisory board contracts. Issuing or
34 delivering or permitting agents, officers or employees to issue or deliver,
35 agency company stock or other capital stock, or benefit certificates or
36 shares in any common-law corporation, or securities or any special or
37 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns
38 and profits as an inducement to insurance. Nothing herein shall prohibit
39 the acts permitted by K.S.A. 40-232, and amendments thereto.
40 (7) Unfair discrimination. (a) Making or permitting any unfair
41 discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation
42 of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or life annuity
43 or in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the

HB 2043—Am. by SC 3
1 terms and conditions of such contract.
2 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between
3 individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the
4 amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract
5 of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in
6 any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner
7 whatever.
8 (c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
9 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual, or
10 charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage solely
11 because of blindness or partial blindness. With respect to all other
12 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
13 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
14 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
15 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
16 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
17 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
18 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
19 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
20 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.
21 (d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
22 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health
23 and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a
24 different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for
25 losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based
26 on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or
27 may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
28 (d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined
29 in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto, between family members,
30 current or former household members, or current or former intimate
31 partners.
32 (i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health
33 insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may
34 be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek
35 medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse,
36 protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
37 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
38 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
39 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
40 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
41 insurance policy.
42 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
43 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall

HB 2043—Am. by SC 4
1 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
2 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
3 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
4 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
5 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
6 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
7 based on sound actuarial principles.
8 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
9 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
10 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
11 provided that:
12 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
13 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
14 of abuse;
15 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
16 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
17 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
18 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
19 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
20 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
21 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
22 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.

19 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
20 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
