30 and digital proof of identification card showing or turning over their
31 electronic device to any other person or entity in order to provide proof of
32 digital proof of driver's license and digital proof of identification card for

30 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 8-235 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-235. (a)
31 No person, except those expressly exempted, shall drive any motor vehicle
32 upon a highway in this state unless such person has a valid driver's license.
33 No person shall receive a driver's license unless and until such person
34 surrenders or with the approval of the division, lists to the division all
35 valid licenses in such person's possession issued to such person by any
36 other jurisdiction. All surrendered licenses, digital proof of drivers'
37 licenses or the information listed on foreign licenses shall be returned by

42 may exercise the privilege granted upon all streets and highways in this

2 requiring licenses of persons who drive taxicabs or municipally franchised
3 transit systems for hire upon city streets, to protect the public from drivers
4 whose character or habits make them unfit to transport the public. If a
5 license is denied, the applicant may appeal such decision to the district
6 court of the county in which such city is located by filing within 14 days
7 after such denial, a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court and
8 by filing a copy of such notice with the city clerk of the involved city. The
9 city clerk shall certify a copy of such decision of the city governing body
10 to the clerk of the district court and the matter shall be docketed as any
11 other cause and the applicant shall be granted a trial of such person's
12 character and habits. The matter shall be heard by the court de novo in
13 accordance with the code of civil procedure. The cost of such appeal shall
14 be assessed in such manner as the court may direct.
15 (c) Any person operating in this state a motor vehicle shall be the
16 holder of a driver's license that is classified for the operation of such motor
17 vehicle, and any person operating in this state a motorcycle that is
18 registered in this state shall be the holder of a class M driver's license.

20 this state unless such person:
21 (1) Has a valid driver's license that entitles the licensee to drive a
22 motor vehicle in any class or classes;
23 (2) is at least 15 years of age and has passed the written and visual
24 examinations required for obtaining a class C driver's license, in which
25 case the division shall issue to such person a class C license, which shall
26 clearly indicate that such license is valid only for the operation of
27 motorized bicycles; or
28 (3) has had their driving privileges revoked under K.S.A. 8-286, and
29 amendments thereto, has not had a test refusal or test failure or alcohol or
30 drug-related conviction, as those terms are defined in K.S.A. 8-1013, and
31 amendments thereto, in the last five years, has not been convicted of a
32 violation of K.S.A. 8-1568(b), and amendments thereto, in the last five
33 years and has made application to the division for issuance of a class C
34 license for the operation of motorized bicycles, in accordance with
35 paragraph (2), in which case the division shall issue such person a class C
36 license, which shall clearly indicate that such license is valid only for the
37 operation of motorized bicycles. As used in this subsection, "motorized
38 bicycle" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in K.S.A. 8-126, and
39 amendments thereto.
40 (e) Violation of this section is a class B nonperson misdemeanor.

9 or commercial drive test fee shall not be required. The examination shall
10 consist of three tests, as follows: (A) Vision; (B) written; and (C) driving.
11 For a commercial driver's license, the drive test shall consist of three
12 components, as follows: (A) Pre-trip; (B) skills test; and (C) road test. If
13 the applicant fails the vision test, the applicant may have correction of
14 vision made and take the vision test again without any additional fee. If an
15 applicant fails the written test, the applicant may take such test again upon
16 the payment of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant fails

20 may take such test again upon the payment of an additional drive test fee
21 of $10. If an applicant fails to pass all three of the tests within a period of
22 six months from the date of original application and desires to take
23 additional tests, the applicant shall file an application for reexamination
24 upon a form furnished by the division, which shall be accompanied by a
25 reexamination fee of $3, except that any applicant who fails to pass the
26 written or driving portion of an examination four times within a six-month
27 period, shall be required to wait a period of six months from the date of the
28 last failed examination before additional examinations may be given.
29 Upon the filing of such application and the payment of such reexamination
30 fee, the applicant shall be entitled to reexamination in like manner and
31 subject to the additional fees and time limitation as provided for
32 examination on an original application. If the applicant passes the
33 reexamination, the applicant shall be issued the classified driver's license
34 for which the applicant originally applied, which license shall be issued to
35 expire as if the applicant had passed the original examination.
36 (2) Applicants for class M licenses who have completed prior

15 document is acceptable if it includes both the applicant's full legal name
16 and date of birth, and documentation showing the applicant's name, the
17 applicant's address of principal residence and the applicant's social security
18 number. The applicant's social security number shall remain confidential

33 remain effective until invalidated. The word "Donor" shall be placed on
34 the front of an applicant's identification card, indicating that the statement
35 for making an anatomical gift under this subsection has been executed by
36 such applicant.
37 Sec. 15. K.S.A. 8-235, 8-240, 8-1325 and 8-1328 and K.S.A. 2024
