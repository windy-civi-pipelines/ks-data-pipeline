25 (b) Valuations shall be established for each parcel of real property at

27 79-503a, and amendments thereto.
28 (c) (1) Valuations shall be established for each parcel of land devoted
29 to agricultural use upon the basis of the agricultural income or productivity
30 attributable to the inherent capabilities of such land in its current usage
31 under a degree of management reflecting median production levels in the
32 manner hereinafter provided. A classification system for all land devoted
33 to agricultural use shall be adopted by the director of property valuation
34 using criteria established by the United States department of agriculture
35 natural resources conservation service.
36 (A) For all taxable years commencing after December 31, 1989, all
37 land devoted to agricultural use that is subject to the federal conservation
38 reserve program shall be classified as cultivated dry land for the purpose
39 of valuation for property tax purposes pursuant to this section, except that
40 for all taxable years commencing after December 31, 2022, all land

6 (2) Productivity of land devoted to agricultural use shall be

8 based on an average of the eight calendar years immediately preceding the
9 calendar year that immediately precedes the year of valuation, at a degree
10 of management reflecting median production levels. The director of
11 property valuation shall determine median production levels based on
12 information available from state and federal crop and livestock reporting
13 services, the natural resources conservation service, and any other sources
14 of data that the director considers appropriate.
15 (d) The share of net income from land in the various land classes
16 within each county or homogeneous region that is normally received by

18 for all land devoted to agricultural use except pasture or rangeland. The net
19 income normally received by the landlord from such land shall be
20 determined by deducting expenses normally incurred by the landlord from
21 the share of the gross income normally received by the landlord. The net
22 rental income normally received by the landlord from pasture or rangeland
23 within each county or homogeneous region shall be used as the basis for
24 determining agricultural income from such land. The net rental income
25 from pasture and rangeland that is normally received by the landlord shall
26 be determined by deducting expenses normally incurred from the gross
27 income normally received by the landlord. Commodity prices, crop yields
28 and pasture and rangeland rental rates and expenses shall be based on an
29 average of the eight calendar years immediately preceding the calendar
30 year that immediately precedes the year of valuation. Net income for every
31 land class within each county or homogeneous region shall be capitalized
32 at a rate determined to be the sum of the contract rate of interest on new
33 federal land bank loans in Kansas on July 1 of each year averaged over a
34 five-year period that includes the five years immediately preceding the
35 calendar year which immediately precedes the year of valuation, plus a
36 percentage not less than 0.75% nor more than 2.75%, as determined by the
37 director of property valuation, except that the capitalization rate calculated
38 for property tax year 2003, and all such years thereafter, shall not be less
39 than 11% nor more than 12%.
40 (e) Based on the procedures provided in this section, the director of
41 property valuation shall make an annual determination of the value of land
42 within each of the various classes of land devoted to agricultural use
43 within each county or homogeneous region and furnish the same to the

HB 2400 4
