KANSAS DEPARTMENT FOR

above agency from such account during fiscal year 2026, to establish
the mental health intervention team program as provided by the

thereto, and continued and expanded through subsequent appropriation
acts of the legislature: And provided further, That the purposes of the
mental health intervention team program are to: Provide greater access
to behavioral health services for students enrolled in kindergarten or

between school districts and mental health intervention team providers
to optimize scarce behavioral health resources and workforce; identify
students, communicate with families and link students and their
families to the statewide behavioral health systems and resources
within the network of mental health intervention team providers;
alleviate the shortage of staff with specialized degrees or training such
as school counselors, psychologists and social workers and reduce the
competition for such staff between school districts and other private
and governmental service providers to provide broader-based and
collaborative services to students, especially in rural districts that do
not have enough students to justify a full-time staff position; provide
and coordinate mental health services to students throughout the
calendar year, not only during school hours over nine months of the
school year; and reduce barriers that families experience to access
mental health services and maintain consistency for a child to attend
recurring sessions and coordination between the child's classroom
schedule and the provision of such services: And provided further, That
the program shall focus on the following students: Any student who has
been adjudicated as a child in need of care and is in the custody of the
secretary for children and families or has been referred for a families
first program or family preservation program; and any other student

That the secretary for aging and disability services shall appoint a
mental health intervention team program manager and, within the limits

further, That if the school district chooses to partner with more than one
mental health intervention team provider, the school district shall enter
into a separate memorandum of understanding with each such mental
health intervention team provider: And provided further, That the above

provided further, That such category of provider shall provide the
required services and otherwise meet the requirements of a partnering
mental health intervention team provider under this proviso: And
provided further, That if the above agency authorizes another category
of provider other than a mental health intervention team provider, such
agency shall provide notification of this decision to the mental health
intervention team provider that provides services in that county: And
provided further, That, subject to appropriations therefor, a school
district and mental health intervention team provider that have been
approved by the above agency to establish or maintain a mental health
intervention team program shall be eligible to receive a mental health
intervention team program grant and a mental health intervention team
provider pass-through grant: Provided, however, That the amount of a
school district's mental health intervention team program grant shall be
determined in each school year by calculating the total amount of the
salary and fringe benefits paid by the school district to each school
liaison: And provided further, That the amount of a school district's
mental health intervention team provider pass-through grant shall be an
amount equal to 35% of the amount of the school district's mental
health intervention team grant: And provided further, That moneys
provided to a school district for the mental health intervention team
provider pass-through grant shall be paid to any mental health
intervention team provider that partners with the school district: And
provided further, That if the amount of appropriations are insufficient to

receive for the school year, the above agency shall prorate the amount

of mental health intervention team providers of Kansas to fund training
for school districts participating in the mental health intervention team
program pursuant to this proviso: And provided further, That the above
agency shall seek advice from mental health intervention team
providers prior to awarding any grant under this subsection: And
provided further, That the above agency may waive the requirement
that a school district employ a school liaison and may instead authorize
a mental health intervention team provider that partners with the school
district to employ a school liaison: And provided further, That such
waiver shall only be granted by the above agency in limited
circumstances: And provided further, That a school district that is
granted a waiver pursuant to this proviso shall continue to be eligible to
receive the mental health intervention team program grant and the
mental health intervention team provider pass-through grant authorized
pursuant to this proviso: And provided further, That the amount of the
mental health intervention team program grant shall be determined in
the same manner as provided under this proviso as though the school
liaison was employed by such school district: And provided further,

intervention team provider that employs the school liaison: And

students, communicate with families and link students and their

not have enough students to justify a full-time staff position; provide
and coordinate mental health services to students throughout the
