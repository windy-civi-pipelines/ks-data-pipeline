39 local official in this state shall attempt to independently determine whether
40 an individual is an unauthorized alien or an alien not lawfully present in
41 the United States. Such determination shall only be made by verifying the
42 alien's employment authorization status with the federal government
43 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c).

SB 196 4
1 (2) When making a determination of whether an employee is an
2 unauthorized alien, a court shall only consider the federal government's
3 determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c). The court shall take judicial
4 notice of any verification of the employment authorization status
5 previously provided by the federal government. The court may, and at the
6 request of a party shall, request the federal government to provide a new
7 verification of the employment authorization status of the employee
8 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c). The most recent determination of the

32 attorney general, the business entity shall provide this documentation to
33 such county or district attorney or the attorney general.
34 (2) The provisions of this subsection may be enforced in the courts of
35 this state by a civil action brought by any county or district attorney or the
36 attorney general. Upon a finding of a violation of this subsection by a

17 utilizing e-verify to verify the employment authorization of all new

32 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
33 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
34 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
35 with the modifications specified in this section.
36 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
37 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
38 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
39 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
40 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
41 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
42 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
43 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be

SB 196 6
1 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
2 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
3 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after

6 income.
7 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
8 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
9 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not

11 imposed under the provisions of K.S.A. 79-1107 or 79-1108, and

18 deduction of the taxes being refunded resulted in a tax benefit for Kansas
19 income tax purposes during a prior taxable year. Such refunds shall be
20 included in income in the year actually received regardless of the method
21 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
22 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
23 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
24 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
25 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
26 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
27 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
