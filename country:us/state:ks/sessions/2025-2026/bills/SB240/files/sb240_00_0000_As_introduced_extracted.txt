12 presents, causes to be presented or prepares with knowledge or belief that
13 it will be presented to or by an insurer, purported insurer, broker or any
14 agent thereof, or the Kansas automobile assigned claims plan, any written,
15 electronic, electronic impulse, facsimile, magnetic, oral, or telephonic
16 communication or statement as part of, or in support of, an application for
17 the issuance of, or the rating of an insurance policy for personal or
18 commercial insurance, or a claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to
19 an insurance policy for commercial or personal insurance or automobile
20 assigned claims plan that such person knows to contain materially false
21 information concerning any fact material thereto; or conceals, for the
22 purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.
23 (b) An insurer or automobile assigned claims plan that has
24 knowledge or a good faith belief that a fraudulent insurance act is being or
25 has been committed shall provide to the commissioner, on a form
26 prescribed by the commissioner, any and all information and such
27 additional information relating to such fraudulent insurance act as the
28 commissioner may require.
29 (c) Any other person who has knowledge or a good faith belief that a
30 fraudulent insurance act is being or has been committed may provide to
31 the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, any and all
32 information and such additional information relating to such fraudulent
33 insurance act as the commissioner may request.
34 (d) (1) Each insurer and automobile assigned claims plan shall have
35 antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect fraudulent insurance
36 acts. Antifraud initiatives may include fraud investigators, who may be
37 insurer employees or independent contractors and an antifraud plan
38 submitted to the commissioner not later than July 1, 2007. Each insurer
39 and automobile assigned claims plan that submits an antifraud plan shall
40 notify the commissioner of any material change in the information
41 contained in the antifraud plan within 30 days after such change occurs.
42 Such insurer or automobile assigned claims plan shall submit to the
43 commissioner in writing the amended antifraud plan.
SB 240 12
1 (2) Any antifraud plan, or any amendment thereof, submitted to the
2 commissioner for informational purposes only shall be confidential and
3 not be a public record and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in
4 a civil action unless following an in camera review, the court determines
5 that the antifraud plan is relevant and otherwise admissible under the rules
6 of evidence set forth in article 4 of chapter 60 of the Kansas Statutes
7 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
8 (e) Except as otherwise specifically provided in K.S.A. 44-5,125, and
9 amendments thereto, and K.S.A. 21-5812(a), and amendments thereto, a
10 fraudulent insurance act shall constitute a severity level 6, nonperson
11 felony if the amount involved is $25,000 or more; a severity level 7,
12 nonperson felony if the amount involved is at least $5,000 but less than
13 $25,000; a severity level 8, nonperson felony if the amount involved is at
14 least $1,000 but less than $5,000; and a class C nonperson misdemeanor if
15 the amount involved is less than $1,000. Any combination of fraudulent
16 acts as defined in subsection (a) that occur in a period of six consecutive
17 months and that involve $25,000 or more shall have a presumptive
18 sentence of imprisonment regardless of its location on the sentencing grid
19 block.
20 (f) In addition to any other penalty, a person who violates this statute
21 shall be ordered to make restitution to the insurer or any other person or
22 entity for any financial loss sustained as a result of such violation. An
23 insurer shall not be required to provide coverage or pay any claim
24 involving a fraudulent insurance act.
25 (g) For the purposes of this section:
26 (1) "Amount involved" means the greater of: (A) The actual
27 pecuniary harm resulting from the fraudulent insurance act; (B) the
28 pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the fraudulent insurance
29 act; or (C) the intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible
30 or unlikely to occur, such as in a government sting operation or a fraud in
31 which the claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to an insurance
32 policy exceeded the allowed value. The aggregate dollar amount of the
33 fraudulent claims submitted to the insurance company shall constitute
34 prima facie evidence of the amount of intended loss and is sufficient to
35 establish the aggregate amount involved in the fraudulent insurance act, if
36 not rebutted; and
37 (2) "pecuniary harm" means harm that is monetary or that otherwise
38 is readily measurable in money, and does not include emotional distress,
39 harm to reputation or other non-economic harm.
40 (h) This act shall apply to all insurance applications, ratings, claims
41 and other benefits made pursuant to any insurance policy or automobile
42 assigned claims plan.
43 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-2,119 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
SB 240 13
1 2,119. In the absence of fraud, bad faith or malice, no person or, insurer or
2 automobile assigned claims plan shall be subject to civil liability for libel,
3 slander or any other relevant cause of action:
4 (a) For filing reports or furnishing other information required by
5 chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or
6 required by the commissioner under the authority granted in chapter 40 of
7 the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
8 (b) for any information relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts
9 furnished to or received from law enforcement officials, their agents and
10 employees;
11 (c) for any information relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts
12 furnished to or received from other persons subject to the provisions of
13 chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
14 (d) for any such information furnished in reports to the insurance
15 department, regulatory agencies of any other state, the national association
16 of insurance commissioners or any organization established to detect and
17 prevent fraudulent insurance acts, their agents, employees or designees; or
18 (e) for the publication of any report or bulletin related to the official
19 activities of the insurance department by the commissioner or any
20 employee of the insurance department. Nothing herein is intended to
21 abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or
22 immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person.
23 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 21-6614, 40-2,118 and 40-2,119 are hereby repealed.
24 Sec. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
25 publication in the statute book.

Session of 2025
SENATE BILL No. 240
By Committee on Judiciary
2-6
1 AN ACT concerning fraudulent insurance acts; establishing procedures for
2 a civil action instituted by the commissioner of insurance and
3 authorizing civil penalties, restitution and other relief; providing that
4 expunged criminal records will be disclosed in any application for
5 licensure as an insurance producer or public adjuster if the arrest,
6 conviction or diversion is for a fraudulent insurance act; including
7 automobile assigned claims plans in provisions related to fraudulent
8 insurance acts; amending K.S.A. 21-6614, 40-2,118 and 40-2,119 and

11 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
12 New Section 1. (a) If the commissioner believes that a person has
13 committed a fraudulent insurance act, the commissioner may bring a civil
14 action in the district court of Shawnee county or in the district court of any
15 county in which an alleged fraudulent insurance act occurred.
16 (b) In an action brought pursuant to this section, the burden of proof
17 shall be on the commissioner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
18 that the person committed a fraudulent insurance act.
19 (c) In an action pursuant to this section, if the court finds that the
20 person committed a fraudulent insurance act, the court may:
21 (1) Impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each fraudulent
22 insurance act, which shall be paid into the insurance department service
23 regulation fund;
24 (2) order the person who engaged in the fraudulent insurance act to
25 pay restitution to the insurer or automobile assigned claims plan to the
26 extent of such insurer's or plan's actual pecuniary harm;
27 (3) order payment of reasonable expenses and investigation fees
28 incurred by the department of insurance as a result of the fraudulent
29 insurance act or acts, which shall be paid into the department of insurance
30 service regulation fund; and
31 (4) order such other relief as the court considers appropriate.
32 (d) An aggrieved insurer or automobile assigned claims plan shall not
33 be joined as a party pursuant to K.S.A 60-219 or 60-220, and amendments

2 (f) In an action pursuant to this section, a person shall not be excused
3 from testifying, producing a record or other evidence or obeying a

5 evidence, directly or indirectly, may tend to incriminate the individual or
6 subject the person to a criminal fine, penalty or forfeiture. If the person
7 refuses to testify, produce a record or other evidence or obey a subpoena
8 based on the person's privilege against self-incrimination, the court may
9 compel the testimony, the production of the record or other evidence or
10 compliance with the subpoena. The testimony, record or other evidence
11 compelled under such an order shall not be used, directly or indirectly,
12 against the person in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury or

9 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 40-2,118 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
10 2,118. (a) For purposes of this act, a "fraudulent insurance act" means an
11 act committed by any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud,
12 presents, causes to be presented or prepares with knowledge or belief that
13 it will be presented to or by an insurer, purported insurer, broker or any
14 agent thereof, or the Kansas automobile assigned claims plan, any written,
15 electronic, electronic impulse, facsimile, magnetic, oral, or telephonic
16 communication or statement as part of, or in support of, an application for
17 the issuance of, or the rating of an insurance policy for personal or
18 commercial insurance, or a claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to
19 an insurance policy for commercial or personal insurance or automobile
20 assigned claims plan that such person knows to contain materially false
21 information concerning any fact material thereto; or conceals, for the
22 purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.
23 (b) An insurer or automobile assigned claims plan that has
24 knowledge or a good faith belief that a fraudulent insurance act is being or
25 has been committed shall provide to the commissioner, on a form
26 prescribed by the commissioner, any and all information and such
27 additional information relating to such fraudulent insurance act as the
28 commissioner may require.
29 (c) Any other person who has knowledge or a good faith belief that a
30 fraudulent insurance act is being or has been committed may provide to
31 the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, any and all
32 information and such additional information relating to such fraudulent
33 insurance act as the commissioner may request.
34 (d) (1) Each insurer and automobile assigned claims plan shall have
35 antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect fraudulent insurance
36 acts. Antifraud initiatives may include fraud investigators, who may be
37 insurer employees or independent contractors and an antifraud plan
38 submitted to the commissioner not later than July 1, 2007. Each insurer
39 and automobile assigned claims plan that submits an antifraud plan shall
40 notify the commissioner of any material change in the information
41 contained in the antifraud plan within 30 days after such change occurs.
42 Such insurer or automobile assigned claims plan shall submit to the
43 commissioner in writing the amended antifraud plan.

SB 240 12
1 (2) Any antifraud plan, or any amendment thereof, submitted to the
2 commissioner for informational purposes only shall be confidential and
3 not be a public record and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in
4 a civil action unless following an in camera review, the court determines
5 that the antifraud plan is relevant and otherwise admissible under the rules
6 of evidence set forth in article 4 of chapter 60 of the Kansas Statutes
7 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
8 (e) Except as otherwise specifically provided in K.S.A. 44-5,125, and
9 amendments thereto, and K.S.A. 21-5812(a), and amendments thereto, a
10 fraudulent insurance act shall constitute a severity level 6, nonperson
11 felony if the amount involved is $25,000 or more; a severity level 7,
12 nonperson felony if the amount involved is at least $5,000 but less than
13 $25,000; a severity level 8, nonperson felony if the amount involved is at
14 least $1,000 but less than $5,000; and a class C nonperson misdemeanor if
15 the amount involved is less than $1,000. Any combination of fraudulent
16 acts as defined in subsection (a) that occur in a period of six consecutive
17 months and that involve $25,000 or more shall have a presumptive
18 sentence of imprisonment regardless of its location on the sentencing grid
19 block.
20 (f) In addition to any other penalty, a person who violates this statute
21 shall be ordered to make restitution to the insurer or any other person or
22 entity for any financial loss sustained as a result of such violation. An
23 insurer shall not be required to provide coverage or pay any claim
24 involving a fraudulent insurance act.
25 (g) For the purposes of this section:
26 (1) "Amount involved" means the greater of: (A) The actual
27 pecuniary harm resulting from the fraudulent insurance act; (B) the
28 pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the fraudulent insurance
29 act; or (C) the intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible
30 or unlikely to occur, such as in a government sting operation or a fraud in
31 which the claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to an insurance
32 policy exceeded the allowed value. The aggregate dollar amount of the
33 fraudulent claims submitted to the insurance company shall constitute
34 prima facie evidence of the amount of intended loss and is sufficient to
35 establish the aggregate amount involved in the fraudulent insurance act, if
36 not rebutted; and
37 (2) "pecuniary harm" means harm that is monetary or that otherwise
38 is readily measurable in money, and does not include emotional distress,
39 harm to reputation or other non-economic harm.
40 (h) This act shall apply to all insurance applications, ratings, claims
41 and other benefits made pursuant to any insurance policy or automobile
42 assigned claims plan.
43 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-2,119 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-

SB 240 13
1 2,119. In the absence of fraud, bad faith or malice, no person or, insurer or
2 automobile assigned claims plan shall be subject to civil liability for libel,
3 slander or any other relevant cause of action:
4 (a) For filing reports or furnishing other information required by
5 chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or
6 required by the commissioner under the authority granted in chapter 40 of
7 the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
8 (b) for any information relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts
9 furnished to or received from law enforcement officials, their agents and
10 employees;
11 (c) for any information relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts
12 furnished to or received from other persons subject to the provisions of
13 chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
14 (d) for any such information furnished in reports to the insurance
15 department, regulatory agencies of any other state, the national association
16 of insurance commissioners or any organization established to detect and
17 prevent fraudulent insurance acts, their agents, employees or designees; or
18 (e) for the publication of any report or bulletin related to the official
19 activities of the insurance department by the commissioner or any
20 employee of the insurance department. Nothing herein is intended to
21 abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or
22 immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person.
23 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 21-6614, 40-2,118 and 40-2,119 are hereby repealed.
24 Sec. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
25 publication in the statute book.
