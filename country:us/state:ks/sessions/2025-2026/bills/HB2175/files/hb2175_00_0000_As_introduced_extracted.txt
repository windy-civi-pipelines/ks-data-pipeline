42 (2) The secretary or a law enforcement officer may request the

9 conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the secretary and the investigating
10 law enforcement agency, or the designees of the secretary and such
11 agency, shall both visually observe the child who is the alleged victim of
12 abuse or neglect. All investigation reports shall include the date, time and

26 determines that an investigation shall be closed, whether such
27 investigation results in a referral to the county or district attorney, the
28 secretary shall make a complete written report of the investigation
29 conducted and findings of such investigation. Such report shall be
30 included in the file of the child who is the subject of the investigation.

38 secretary be granted access to the child to interview, examine and
39 investigate, except that the secretary may have access to the child when
40 the secretary:

22 assist in the investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect, the court
23 may issue a subpoena, subpoena duces tecum or an order for the
24 production of the requested documents, reports or information and
25 directing the documents, reports or information to be delivered to the

34 designated by the court.
35 (B) The court shall not issue an order or conduct a hearing under

5 with an alcohol or substance abuse problem as defined in K.S.A. 59-
6 29b46, and amendments thereto, the court may:
7 (1)(A) Direct or authorize the county or district attorney or the person

10 issues raised by the application as provided in the care and treatment act
11 for mentally ill persons or the petition provided for in K.S.A. 59-29b57,
12 and amendments thereto, and proceed to hear and determine the issues
13 raised by the application as provided in the care and treatment act for
14 persons with an alcohol or substance abuse problem; or
15 (2)(B) authorize that the child seek voluntary admission to a treatment
16 facility as provided in K.S.A. 59-2949, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A.
17 59-29b49, and amendments thereto.
18 (2) The application to determine whether the child is a mentally ill
19 person or a person with an alcohol or substance abuse problem may be
20 filed in the same proceedings as the petition alleging the child to be a child
21 in need of care, or may be brought in separate proceedings. In either event,
22 the court may enter an order staying any further proceedings under this
23 code until all proceedings have been concluded under the care and
24 treatment act for mentally ill persons or the care and treatment act for
25 persons with an alcohol or substance abuse problem.
26 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2226 is hereby amended to read as
27 follows: 38-2226. (a) Investigation for child abuse or neglect. The
28 secretary and law enforcement officers shall have the duty to receive and
29 investigate reports of child abuse or neglect for the purpose of determining
30 whether the report is valid and whether action is required to protect a
31 child. Any person or agency which that maintains records relating to the
32 involved child which that are relevant to any investigation conducted by
33 the secretary or law enforcement agency under this code shall provide the
34 secretary or law enforcement agency with the necessary records to assist in
35 investigations. In order to provide such records, the person or agency
36 maintaining the records shall receive from the secretary or law
37 enforcement:
38 (1) A written request for information; and
39 (2) a written notice that the investigation is being conducted by the
40 secretary or law enforcement. If the secretary and such officers determine
41 that no action is necessary to protect the child but that a criminal
42 prosecution should be considered, such law enforcement officers shall
43 make a report of the case to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

HB 2175 8
1 (b) Joint investigations. When a report of child abuse or neglect
2 indicates: (1) That there is serious physical harm to, serious deterioration
3 of or sexual abuse of the child; and (2) that action may be required to
4 protect the child, the investigation shall be conducted as a joint effort
5 between the secretary and the appropriate law enforcement agency or
6 agencies, with a free exchange of information between them pursuant to
7 K.S.A. 38-2210, and amendments thereto. If a statement of a suspect is
8 obtained by either agency, a copy of the statement shall be provided to the
9 other.
10 (c) Investigation of certain cases. Suspected child abuse or neglect
11 which that occurs in an institution operated by the Kansas department of
12 corrections shall be investigated by the attorney general or secretary of
13 corrections. Any suspected child abuse or neglect in an institution operated
14 by the Kansas department for aging and disability services, or by persons
15 employed by the Kansas department for aging and disability services or
16 the Kansas department for children and families, or of children of persons
17 employed by either department, shall be investigated by the appropriate
18 law enforcement agency.
19 (d) Coordination of investigations by county or district attorney. If a
20 dispute develops between agencies investigating a reported case of child
21 abuse or neglect, the appropriate county or district attorney shall take
22 charge of, direct and coordinate the investigation.
23 (e) Investigations concerning certain facilities. Any investigation
24 involving a facility subject to licensing or regulation by the secretary of
25 health and environment shall be promptly reported to the state secretary of
26 health and environment.
27 (f) Cooperation between agencies. Law enforcement agencies and the
28 secretary shall assist each other in taking action which that is necessary to
29 protect a child regardless of which agency conducted the initial
30 investigation.
31 (g) Cooperation between school personnel and investigative
32 agencies. (1) Educational institutions, the secretary and law enforcement
33 agencies shall cooperate with each other in the investigation of reports of
34 suspected child abuse or neglect. The secretary and law enforcement
35 agencies shall have access to a child in a setting designated by school
36 personnel on the premises of an educational institution. Attendance at an
37 interview conducted on such premises shall be at the discretion of the
38 agency conducting the interview, giving consideration to the best interests
39 of the child. To the extent that safety and practical considerations allow,
40 law enforcement officers on such premises for the purpose of investigating
41 a report of suspected child abuse or neglect shall not be in uniform.
42 (2) The secretary or a law enforcement officer may request the
43 presence of school personnel during an interview if the secretary or officer

HB 2175 9
1 determines that the presence of such person might provide comfort to the
2 child or facilitate the investigation.
3 (h) Visual observation required. As part of any investigation
4 conducted pursuant to this sectionWhen the secretary or law enforcement
5 opens an investigation of abuse or neglect, the secretary or the law
6 enforcement agency, or such agency's designee, that is conducting the
7 investigation shall, as soon as possible, visually observe the child who is
8 the alleged victim of abuse or neglect. In the case of a joint investigation
9 conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the secretary and the investigating
10 law enforcement agency, or the designees of the secretary and such
11 agency, shall both visually observe the child who is the alleged victim of
12 abuse or neglect. All investigation reports shall include the date, time and
13 location of any visual observation of a child that is required by this
14 subsection.
15 (i) Child abuse review and evaluation referrals. (1) Upon
16 investigation by law enforcement or assignment by the secretary of any
17 investigation of physical abuse or physical neglect conducted pursuant to
18 this section that concerns a child five years of age or younger, the
19 secretary, the law enforcement agency or the agency's designee shall make
20 a CARE referral for such child.
21 (2) In any other investigation of physical abuse, emotional abuse,
22 medical neglect or physical neglect conducted pursuant to this section, the
23 secretary, the law enforcement agency or the agency's designee may make
24 a CARE referral for such child.
25 (j) Report required for closed investigations. When the secretary
26 determines that an investigation shall be closed, whether such
27 investigation results in a referral to the county or district attorney, the
28 secretary shall make a complete written report of the investigation
29 conducted and findings of such investigation. Such report shall be
30 included in the file of the child who is the subject of the investigation.
31 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 38-2229 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
32 2229. (a) (1) A person shall not interfere with an investigation of child
33 abuse or neglect being conducted under this code.
34 (2) If the secretary is denied access to the child who is the subject of
35 an investigation in the home, school or other place and the court
36 determines there is probable cause to believe that access is necessary to
37 protect the child from abuse or neglect, the court shall order that the
38 secretary be granted access to the child to interview, examine and
39 investigate, except that the secretary may have access to the child when
40 the secretary:
41 (A) Has probable cause to believe the child has been harmed;
42 (B) has probable cause to believe that the child is a missing person
43 or a verified missing person entry for the child can be found in the

HB 2175 10
1 national crime information center missing person system;
2 (C) reasonably believes the child is a victim of human trafficking,
3 aggravated human trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation of a
4 child; or
5 (D) reasonably believes the child is experiencing a behavioral health
6 crisis and is likely to cause harm to self or others.
7 (3) (A) The court shall not issue an order or conduct a hearing under
8 this section ex parte unless the court has probable cause to believe that
9 conducting a full hearing would endanger or harm the physical health or
10 safety of the child.
11 (B) A court order described by paragraph (2) shall include written
12 findings of fact whether evidence is sufficient to support an order issued.
13 (C) Upon the request of a party to a proceeding initiated under this
14 section, the court shall provide a copy of an order issued under this
15 section to such party.
16 (b) (1) The secretary, a law enforcement officer, or a multidisciplinary
17 team appointed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2228, and amendments thereto, may
18 request disclosure of documents, reports or information in regard to a
19 child, who is the subject of a report of abuse or neglect, by making a
20 written verified application to the district court. Upon a finding by the
21 court that there is probable cause to believe the information sought will
22 assist in the investigation of a report of child abuse or neglect, the court
23 may issue a subpoena, subpoena duces tecum or an order for the
24 production of the requested documents, reports or information and
25 directing the documents, reports or information to be delivered to the
