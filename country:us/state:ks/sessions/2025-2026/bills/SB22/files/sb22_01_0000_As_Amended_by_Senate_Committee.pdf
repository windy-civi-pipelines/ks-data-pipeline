23 (2) the funds shall be applied only in accordance with the terms of the
24 individual instructions or agreements under which the funds were

2 of the individual escrow and none of the funds shall be utilized until the
3 necessary conditions of the escrow have been met. All funds deposited for

34 accounts while acting as a title insurance agent providing any escrow or
35 settlement services.

34 (4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement
35 to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott,

19 terms and conditions of such contract.
20 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between

30 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
31 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
32 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
33 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
34 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
35 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
36 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
37 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
38 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

2 has been, or may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in
3 subsection (7)(d)(v). "Abuse" As used in this paragraph, "abuse" means
4 one or more acts defined in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto,
5 between family members, current or former household members, or
6 current or former intimate partners.
7 (i) An insurer may shall not ask an applicant for life or accident and
8 health insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been
9 or may be the subject of domestic abuse, or seeks, has sought or had
10 reason to seek medical or psychological treatment or counseling
11 specifically for abuse, protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
12 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
13 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
14 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
15 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
16 insurance policy.
17 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
18 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
19 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
20 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
21 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
22 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
23 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
24 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
25 based on sound actuarial principles.
26 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
27 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
28 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
29 provided that:
30 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
31 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
32 of abuse;
33 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
34 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
35 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
36 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
37 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
38 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
39 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
40 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
41 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
42 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
43 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the

SB 22—Am. by SC 7
1 effective date of this act.
2 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
3 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
4 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
5 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
6 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
7 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
8 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
9 donors.
10 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
11 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
12 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to
13 such contract other than as plainly expressed in the insurance contract
14 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
15 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any
16 rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage

18 inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or giving, selling,
19 purchasing or offering to give, sell or purchase as inducement to such
20 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
21 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
22 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
23 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
24 (b) Nothing in subsection (7)(a) or (8)(a) shall be construed as
25 including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the
26 following practices:
27 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
28 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
29 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
30 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
31 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
32 policyholders;
33 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
34 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
35 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
36 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
37 expenses;
38 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
39 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
40 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be
41 made retroactive only for such policy year;
42 (iv) engaging in an arrangement that would not violate section 106 of
43 the bank holding company act amendments of 1972, as interpreted by the

2 home owners' loan act;
3 (v) the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through
4 employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
5 products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services

7 (A) Relates to the insurance coverage; and
8 (B) is primarily designed to satisfy one or more of the following:
9 (1) Provide loss mitigation or loss control;
10 (2) reduce claim costs or claim settlement costs;
11 (3) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons or
12 property;

14 strategies for eliminating or reducing risk;
15 (5) enhance health;
16 (6) enhance financial wellness through items such as education or
17 financial planning services;
18 (7) provide post-loss services;
19 (8) (a) incentivize behavioral changes to improve the health or reduce
20 the risk of death or disability of a customer;

24 (9) assist in the administration of the employee or retiree benefit
25 insurance coverage.
26 (C) The cost to the insurer or producer offering the product or service
27 to any given customer shall be reasonable in comparison to such
28 customer's premiums or insurance coverage for the policy class.
29 (D) If the insurer or producer is providing the product or service
30 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
31 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with
32 questions regarding the product or service.
33 (E) The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations when
34 implementing the permitted practices set forth in this section to ensure

39 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
40 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
41 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
42 (G) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
43 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in

SB 22—Am. by SC 9
1 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
2 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
3 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall

12 commissioner per policy year per term. The offer shall be made in a

14 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
15 for the gift, item or service.

17 as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the drawing
18 or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance, the prizes are

19 insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim
20 report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of
21 loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same
22 information;
23 (m) failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become
24 reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in

37 between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or one or more
38 title insurance companies and one or more title insurance agents, if such
39 division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate under
40 the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a
41 finder's fee.
42 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) through (14)(i), unless the context
43 otherwise requires:

SB 22—Am. by SC 12
1 (i) "Associate" means any firm, association, organization, partnership,
2 business trust, corporation or other legal entity organized for profit in
3 which a producer of title business is a director, officer or partner thereof,
4 or owner of a financial interest; the spouse or any relative within the
5 second degree by blood or marriage of a producer of title business who is a
6 natural person; any director, officer or employee of a producer of title
7 business or associate; any legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
8 under common control with a producer of title business or associate; and
9 any natural person or legal entity with whom a producer of title business or
10 associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding or pursues any
11 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
12 of this section.
13 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
14 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
15 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
16 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
17 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
18 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
19 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
20 business.
21 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
22 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
23 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
24 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or
25 capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business,
26 occupation or profession of:
27 (A) Buying or selling interests in real property;
28 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
29 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
30 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
31 money with such interest as security.
32 (v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any
33 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
34 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
35 with respect to the referral.
36 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
37 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
38 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
39 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
40 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
41 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
42 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
43 business or associate referring the title insurance business.

SB 22—Am. by SC 13
1 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
2 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
3 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
4 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
5 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
6 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
7 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
8 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The
9 prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall not apply to transactions
10 involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by
11 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
12 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
13 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent
14 shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which
15 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
16 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
17 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
18 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
19 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
20 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
21 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
22 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
23 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
24 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
25 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
26 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
27 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
28 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
29 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
30 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
31 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
32 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
33 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges
34 generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services. Such
35 disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated
36 to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate
37 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
38 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
39 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
40 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers
41 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed
42 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment
43 having been made to such title insurer or agent.

SB 22—Am. by SC 14
1 (2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall
2 require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any
3 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
4 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
5 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
6 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
7 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
8 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to
9 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
10 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
11 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
12 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
13 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
14 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
15 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
16 realized from such financial interest, so long as:
17 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
18 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
19 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
20 the referral of business; and
21 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
22 on the investment of the producer or associate.
23 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
24 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
25 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
26 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
27 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
28 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
29 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
30 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
31 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
32 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
33 to the premium for the title insurance.
34 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
35 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
36 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
37 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
38 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
39 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
40 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this
41 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of
42 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.
43 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide

SB 22—Am. by SC 15
1 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
2 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
3 to carry out the provisions of this act.
4 (15) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
5 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
6 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law
7 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
8 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent
9 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
10 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
11 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
12 information regulation".
13 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
14 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
15 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
16 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
17 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
18 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
19 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-1139 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-1137 and 40-2404
20 are hereby repealed.
21 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after
22 January 1, 2026, and its publication in the statute book.
