23 (2) the funds shall be applied only in accordance with the terms of the
24 individual instructions or agreements under which the funds were
25 accepted; and
26 (3) an agent shall not retain any interest on any money held in an

1 funds or other moneys with escrow funds. In addition, the agent shall not
2 use escrow funds to pay or to indemnify against the debts of the agent or

4 of the individual escrow and none of the funds shall be utilized until the
5 necessary conditions of the escrow have been met. All funds deposited for

21 terms and conditions of such contract.
22 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between

32 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
33 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
34 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
35 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
36 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
37 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
38 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
39 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
40 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.
41 (d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting

5 subsection (7)(d)(v). "Abuse" As used in this paragraph, "abuse" means
6 one or more acts defined in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto,
7 between family members, current or former household members, or
8 current or former intimate partners.
9 (i) An insurer may shall not ask an applicant for life or accident and
10 health insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been
11 or may be the subject of domestic abuse, or seeks, has sought or had
12 reason to seek medical or psychological treatment or counseling
13 specifically for abuse, protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
14 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
15 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
16 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
17 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
18 insurance policy.
19 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
20 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
21 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
22 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
23 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
24 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
25 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
26 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
27 based on sound actuarial principles.
28 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
29 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
30 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
31 provided that:
32 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
33 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
34 of abuse;
35 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
36 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
37 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
38 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
39 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
40 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
41 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
42 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
43 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
SB 22—Am. by HC 7
1 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
2 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
3 effective date of this act.
4 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
5 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
6 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
7 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
8 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
9 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
10 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
11 donors.
12 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
13 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
14 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to

16 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
17 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any

22 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
23 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
24 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
25 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
26 (b) Nothing in subsection (7)(a) or (8)(a) shall be construed as
27 including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the
28 following practices:
29 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
30 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
31 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
32 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
33 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
34 policyholders;
35 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
36 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
37 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
38 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
39 expenses;
40 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
41 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
42 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be

22 the risk of death or disability of a customer;

32 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided

4 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
5 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall

1 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) through (14)(i), unless the context
2 otherwise requires:
3 (i) "Associate" means any firm, association, organization, partnership,
4 business trust, corporation or other legal entity organized for profit in
5 which a producer of title business is a director, officer or partner thereof,

12 associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding or pursues any
13 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
14 of this section.
15 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
16 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
17 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
18 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
19 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
20 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
21 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
22 business.
23 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
24 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
25 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
26 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or
27 capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business,
28 occupation or profession of:

30 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
31 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person

35 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
36 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
37 with respect to the referral.
38 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
39 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
40 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
41 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
42 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
43 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
SB 22—Am. by HC 13
1 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
2 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
3 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
4 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
5 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
6 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
7 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
8 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
9 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
10 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The

13 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
14 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
15 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent

17 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
18 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
19 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
20 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
21 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
22 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
23 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
24 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
25 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
26 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
27 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
28 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
29 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
30 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
31 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
32 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
33 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
34 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
35 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges

39 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
40 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
41 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
42 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers
43 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed
SB 22—Am. by HC 14
1 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment
2 having been made to such title insurer or agent.
3 (2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall
4 require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any
5 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
6 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
7 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
8 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
9 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
10 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to
11 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
12 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
13 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
14 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
15 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
16 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
17 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
18 realized from such financial interest, so long as:
19 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
20 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
21 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
22 the referral of business; and
23 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
24 on the investment of the producer or associate.
25 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
26 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
27 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
28 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
29 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
30 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
31 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
32 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
33 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
34 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
35 to the premium for the title insurance.
36 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
37 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
38 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
39 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
40 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
41 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
42 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this
43 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of
SB 22—Am. by HC 15
1 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.
2 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide
3 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
4 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
5 to carry out the provisions of this act.
6 (15) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
7 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
8 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law
9 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
10 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent
11 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
12 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
13 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
14 information regulation".
15 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
16 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
17 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
18 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
19 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
20 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
21 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-1139 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-1137 and 40-2404
22 are hereby repealed.
23 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after
24 January 1, 2026, and its publication in the statute book Kansas register.

12 settlement or closing agent, provided that:
13 (a) All funds deposited with the title insurance agent in connection
14 with an escrow, settlement or closing shall be submitted for collection to,
15 invested in or deposited in a separate fiduciary trust account or accounts in
16 a qualified financial institution no later than the close of the next business
17 day, in accordance with the following requirements:
18 (1) The funds shall be the property of the person or persons entitled to
19 them under the provisions of the escrow, settlement or closing agreement
20 and shall be segregated for each depository by escrow, settlement or
21 closing in the records of the title insurance agent in a manner that permits
22 the funds to be identified on an individual basis;
23 (2) the funds shall be applied only in accordance with the terms of the
24 individual instructions or agreements under which the funds were
25 accepted; and
26 (3) an agent shall not retain any interest on any money held in an
27 interest-bearing account without the written consent of all parties to the
28 transaction.
29 (b) Funds held in an escrow account shall be disbursed only:

35 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
36 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
37 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
38 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
39 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
40 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.
41 (d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
42 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health

1 charging a different rate for the same coverage or, excluding or limiting
2 coverage for losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of
3 abuse based on the fact that the applicant who, is the proposed insured, is,
4 has been, or may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in
5 subsection (7)(d)(v). "Abuse" As used in this paragraph, "abuse" means
6 one or more acts defined in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto,
7 between family members, current or former household members, or
8 current or former intimate partners.
9 (i) An insurer may shall not ask an applicant for life or accident and
10 health insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been
11 or may be the subject of domestic abuse, or seeks, has sought or had
12 reason to seek medical or psychological treatment or counseling
13 specifically for abuse, protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
14 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
15 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
16 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
17 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
18 insurance policy.
19 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
20 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
21 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
22 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
23 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
24 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
25 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
26 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
27 based on sound actuarial principles.
28 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
29 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
30 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
31 provided that:
32 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
33 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
34 of abuse;
35 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
36 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
37 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
38 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
39 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
40 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
41 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
42 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
43 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life

SB 22—Am. by HC 7
1 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
2 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
3 effective date of this act.
4 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
5 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
6 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
7 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
8 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
9 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
10 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
11 donors.
12 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,

23 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
24 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
25 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
26 (b) Nothing in subsection (7)(a) or (8)(a) shall be construed as
27 including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the
28 following practices:
29 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
30 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
31 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
32 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
33 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
34 policyholders;
35 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
36 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
37 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
38 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
39 expenses;
40 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
41 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
42 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be

32 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided

41 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
42 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by

1 (G) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
2 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
3 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
4 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
5 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall

7 consumers in this state prior to launching and may proceed with the
8 program unless the commissioner objects within 21 days of notice.
9 (vi) An insurer or a producer may:

16 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
17 for the gift, item or service.
18 (B) Conduct raffles or drawings to the extent permitted by state law,
19 as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the drawing
20 or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance, the prizes are
21 not valued in excess of a reasonable amount determined by the
22 commissioner and the drawing or raffle is open to the public. The raffle or

21 insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim
22 report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of
23 loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same
24 information;
25 (m) failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become
26 reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in

33 any person, who is an insurer on an insurance policy, to maintain a

36 such records shall be required for complaints received prior to the effective
37 date of this act. The record shall indicate the total number of complaints,
38 their classification by line of insurance, the nature of each complaint, the

11 any natural person or legal entity with whom a producer of title business or
12 associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding or pursues any
13 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
14 of this section.
15 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
16 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
17 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
18 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
19 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
20 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
21 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
22 business.
23 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
24 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
25 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
26 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or

30 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
31 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
32 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
33 money with such interest as security.

35 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
36 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
37 with respect to the referral.
38 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
39 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
40 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
41 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
42 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
43 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the

SB 22—Am. by HC 13
1 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
2 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
3 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
4 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any

10 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The

17 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
18 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
19 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
20 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
21 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
22 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
23 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
24 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
25 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
26 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
27 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
28 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
29 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
30 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
31 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
32 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
33 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
34 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
35 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges

39 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
40 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
41 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
42 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers
43 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed

SB 22—Am. by HC 14
1 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment
2 having been made to such title insurer or agent.
3 (2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall
4 require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any
5 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
6 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
7 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
8 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
9 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
10 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to
11 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
12 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
13 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
14 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
15 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
16 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
17 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
18 realized from such financial interest, so long as:
19 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
20 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
21 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
22 the referral of business; and
23 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
24 on the investment of the producer or associate.
25 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
26 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
27 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
28 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
29 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
30 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
31 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
32 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
33 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
34 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
35 to the premium for the title insurance.
36 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
37 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
38 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
39 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
40 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
41 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
42 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this
43 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of

SB 22—Am. by HC 15
1 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.
2 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide
3 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
4 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
5 to carry out the provisions of this act.
6 (15) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
7 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
8 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law
9 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
10 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent
11 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
12 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
13 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
14 information regulation".
15 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
16 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
17 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
18 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
19 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
20 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
21 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-1139 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-1137 and 40-2404

24 January 1, 2026, and its publication in the statute book Kansas register.
