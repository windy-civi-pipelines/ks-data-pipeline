13 enforcement agency to authorize the law enforcement agency to attach,
14 access, operate, maintain or remove law enforcement equipment on any
15 utility pole that is owned or operated by the public utility and located in

18 enforcement equipment will be attached pursuant to such agreement;
19 (2) specify the nature of the law enforcement equipment to be
20 attached, including, but not limited to, the size and weight of the

23 and any other provisions relating to the safe installation and use of the
24 equipment and the utility pole;
25 (3) establish the utility's safety and security specifications for
26 attaching, accessing, operating, maintaining or removing the law
27 enforcement equipment;
28 (4) provide the public utility the sole discretion to require that the law
29 enforcement equipment be attached, accessed, operated, maintained or

5 attachment agreement or to protect the public utility's systems and
6 infrastructure.
7 (c) Pursuant to a pole attachment agreement, a public utility may

13 equipment requires electricity to be supplied by the public utility, such
14 public utility may charge the law enforcement agency for the electric
15 service. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a public utility from charging
16 any other person or entity for the space required to attach other equipment
17 on utility poles.

26 or appropriate. A public utility that enters into a pole attachment agreement
27 pursuant to this section shall not be liable for any failure of a law
28 enforcement agency to secure a court order when necessary or appropriate
29 for any activity conducted pursuant to the pole attachment agreement.
30 (e) Any public utility that enters into a pole attachment agreement
31 with a law enforcement agency pursuant to this section shall be considered
32 an instrumentality of a governmental entity for the purposes of the Kansas
33 tort claims act, K.S.A. 75-6101 et seq., and amendments thereto, and
34 entitled to any limitations on liability therein. The law enforcement agency
35 shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the public utility for reasonable
36 costs and expenses, including attorney fees, that are associated with any
37 and all:
38 (1) Claims or court actions arising out of the attachment, access,
39 operation, maintenance or removal of law enforcement equipment or law
40 enforcement activities conducted pursuant to such agreement; and

42 enforcement equipment or attachment, access, operation, maintenance or
43 removal of such equipment, except that if any such damage to the utility's
