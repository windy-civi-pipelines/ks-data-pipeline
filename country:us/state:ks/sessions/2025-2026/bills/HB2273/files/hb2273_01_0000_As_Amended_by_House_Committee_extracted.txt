HB 2273—Am. by HC 21
1 provided in K.S.A. 79-4503, and amendments thereto, both domiciled in
2 this state and was:
3 (1) For purposes of a claim under K.S.A. 79-4508, and amendments
4 thereto:
5 (A) A person having a disability;
6 (B) a person who is 55 years of age or older;
7 (C) a disabled veteran;
8 (D) the surviving spouse of a deceased member of the armed forces
9 who died in the line of duty during a period of active service; or
10 (E) a person other than a person included under subparagraph (A),
11 (B), (C) or (D) having one or more dependent children under 18 years of
12 age residing at the person's homestead during the calendar year
13 immediately preceding the year in which a claim is filed under this act; or
14 (2) for purposes of a claim under K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-4508a, and
15 amendments thereto:
16 (A) A person who is 65 years of age or older; or
17 (B) a disabled veteran.
18 The surviving spouse of a disabled veteran who was receiving benefits
19 pursuant to subsection (e)(1)(C) at the time of the veterans' death, shall be
20 eligible to continue to receive benefits until such time the surviving spouse
21 remarries.
22 When a homestead is occupied by two or more individuals and more
23 than one of the individuals is able to qualify as a claimant, the individuals
24 may determine between them as to whom the claimant will be. If they are
25 unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the secretary of revenue
26 whose decision shall be final.
27 (f) "Property taxes accrued" means property taxes, exclusive of
28 special assessments, delinquent interest and charges for service, levied on
29 a claimant's homestead in 1979 or any calendar year thereafter by the state
30 of Kansas and the political and taxing subdivisions of the state. When a
31 homestead is owned by two or more persons or entities as joint tenants or
32 tenants in common and one or more of the persons or entities is not a
33 member of claimant's household, "property taxes accrued" is that part of
34 property taxes levied on the homestead that reflects the ownership
35 percentage of the claimant's household. For purposes of this act, property
36 taxes are "levied" when the tax roll is delivered to the local treasurer with
37 the treasurer's warrant for collection. When a claimant and household own
38 their homestead part of a calendar year, "property taxes accrued" means
39 only taxes levied on the homestead when both owned and occupied as a
40 homestead by the claimant's household at the time of the levy, multiplied
41 by the percentage of 12 months that the property was owned and occupied
42 by the household as its homestead in the year. When a household owns and
43 occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year,
HB 2273—Am. by HC 22
1 property taxes accrued shall be the sum of the taxes allocable to those
2 several properties while occupied by the household as its homestead
3 during the year. Whenever a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit
4 such as a multi-purpose or multi-dwelling building, property taxes accrued
5 shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of
6 the homestead is of the total value. For the purpose of this act, the word
7 "unit" refers to that parcel of property covered by a single tax statement of
8 which the homestead is a part.
9 (g) "Disability" means:
10 (1) Inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of
11 any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be
12 expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a
13 continuous period of not less than 12 months, and an individual shall be
14 determined to be under a disability only if the physical or mental
15 impairment or impairments are of such severity that the individual is not
16 only unable to do the individual's previous work but cannot, considering
17 age, education and work experience, engage in any other kind of
18 substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless
19 of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which the individual
20 lives or whether a specific job vacancy exists for the individual, or whether
21 the individual would be hired if application was made for work. For
22 purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), "work
23 which exists in the national economy" means work which exists in
24 significant numbers either in the region where the individual lives or in
25 several regions of the country; for purposes of this subsection, a "physical
26 or mental impairment" is an impairment that results from anatomical,
27 physiological or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by
28 medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques; or
29 (2) blindness and inability by reason of blindness to engage in
30 substantial gainful activity requiring skills or abilities comparable to those
31 of any gainful activity in which the individual has previously engaged with
32 some regularity and over a substantial period of time.
33 (h) "Blindness" means central visual acuity of 20/ or less in the
200
34 better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied
35 by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the
36 visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be
37 considered for the purpose of this paragraph as having a central visual
38 acuity of 20/ or less.
200
39 (i) "Disabled veteran" means a person who is a resident of Kansas
40 and who:
41 (1) Served in the active military, naval, air or space service, including
42 those groups and individuals listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.7, and who was
43 discharged or released therefrom under an honorable discharge or a
HB 2273—Am. by HC 23
1 general discharge under honorable conditions;
2 (2) received a disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of
3 duty in the active military, naval, air or space service, including those
4 groups and individuals listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.7; and
5 (3) has a service-connected evaluation percentage equal to or greater
6 than 50%, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. or 10 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq.
7 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-160, 8-1,221, 8-243, 8-1324, 32-934,
8 48-3601, 50-676, 73-201, 73-230, 73-1239, 73-1244, 75-3740 and 79-
9 4502 are hereby repealed.
10 Sec. 15. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
11 publication in the statute book.

8 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:

20 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-243 is hereby amended to read as
21 follows: 8-243. (a) Upon payment of the required fee, the division shall
22 issue to every applicant qualifying under the provisions of this act the
23 driver's license as applied for by the applicant. Such license shall bear the
24 class or classes of motor vehicles that the licensee is entitled to drive, a
25 distinguishing number assigned to the licensee, the full legal name, date of
26 birth, gender, address of principal residence and a brief description of the
27 licensee, either: (1) A digital color image or photograph; or (2) a laser-
28 engraved photograph of the licensee, a facsimile of the signature of the
29 licensee and the statement provided for in subsection (b). No driver's
30 license shall be valid until it has been signed by the licensee. All drivers'
31 licenses issued to persons under the age of 21 years shall be readily
32 distinguishable from licenses issued to persons age 21 years or older. In
33 addition, all drivers' licenses issued to persons under the age of 18 years
34 shall also be readily distinguishable from licenses issued to persons age 18
35 years or older. The secretary of revenue shall implement a vertical format

HB 2273—Am. by HC 2
1 to make drivers' licenses issued to persons under the age of 21 more
2 readily distinguishable. Except as otherwise provided, no driver's license
3 issued by the division shall be valid until either: (1) A digital color image
4 or photograph; or (2) a laser-engraved photograph of such licensee has

11 246, and amendments thereto, for issuance of a new license, the division
12 shall issue to such licensee a new license containing either: (1) A digital
13 color image or photograph; or (2) a laser-engraved photograph of such
14 licensee. A driver's license that does not contain the principal address as
15 required may be issued to persons who are program participants pursuant
16 to K.S.A. 75-455, and amendments thereto, upon payment of the fee
17 required by K.S.A. 8-246, and amendments thereto. All Kansas drivers'
18 licenses and identification cards shall have physical security features
19 designed to prevent tampering, counterfeiting or duplication of the
20 document for fraudulent purposes. The secretary of revenue shall
21 incorporate common machine-readable technology into all Kansas drivers'
22 licenses and identification cards.
23 (b) A Kansas driver's license issued to any person 16 years of age or
24 older who indicated on the person's application that the person wished to
25 make a gift of all or any part of the body of the licensee in accordance with
26 the revised uniform anatomical gift act, K.S.A. 65-3220 through 65-3244,
27 and amendments thereto, shall have the word "Donor" placed on the front
28 of the licensee's driver's license.
29 (c) Any person who is deaf or hard of hearing may request that the
30 division issue to such person a driver's license which is readily
31 distinguishable from drivers' licenses issued to other drivers and upon such
32 request the division shall issue such license. Drivers' licenses issued to
33 persons who are deaf or hard of hearing and under the age of 21 years shall
34 be readily distinguishable from drivers' licenses issued to persons who are
35 deaf or hard of hearing and 21 years of age or older. Upon satisfaction of
36 subsection (a), the division shall issue a receipt of application permitting
37 the operation of a vehicle consistent with the requested class, if there are
38 no other restrictions or limitations, pending the division's verification of
39 the information and production of a driver's license.
40 (d) A driver's license issued to a person required to be registered
41 under K.S.A. 22-4901 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be assigned a
42 distinguishing number by the division which will readily indicate to law
43 enforcement officers that such person is a registered offender. The division

HB 2273—Am. by HC 3
1 shall develop a numbering system to implement the provisions of this
2 subsection.
3 (e) (1) Any person who is a veteran may request that the division
4 issue to such person a driver's license that shall include the designation
5 "VETERAN" displayed on the front of the driver's license at a location to
6 be determined by the secretary of revenue. In order to receive a license

10 conditions.

19 vehicles, on a form provided by the director, that such person needs
20 assistance with cognition, including, but not limited to, persons with
21 autism spectrum disorder, may request that the division issue to such
22 person a driver's license, that shall note such impairment on the driver's
23 license at a location to be determined by the secretary of revenue.
24 (2) Satisfactory proof that a person needs assistance with cognition
25 shall include a statement from a person licensed to practice the healing arts
26 in any state, an advanced practice registered nurse licensed under K.S.A.

3 applicant's social security number shall remain confidential and shall not
4 be disclosed, except as provided pursuant to K.S.A. 74-2014, and
5 amendments thereto. If the applicant does not have a social security
6 number, the applicant shall provide proof of lawful presence and Kansas
7 residency. The division shall assign a distinguishing number to the
8 identification card. Before issuing an identification card to a person, the
9 division shall make reasonable efforts to verify with the issuing agency the
10 issuance, validity and completeness of each document required to be
11 presented by the applicant to prove age, identity and lawful presence.
12 (c) The division shall not issue an identification card to any person
13 who fails to provide proof that the person is lawfully present in the United

20 amendments thereto, and subsections (b) and (k), all contracts and
21 purchases made by or under the supervision of the director of purchases or
22 any state agency for which competitive bids are required shall be awarded
23 to the lowest responsible bidder, taking into consideration conformity with
24 the specifications, terms of delivery, and other conditions imposed in the
25 call for bids.
26 (b) A contract shall be awarded to a certified business or disabled
27 veteran business which is also a responsible bidder, whose total bid cost is
28 not more than 10% higher than the lowest competitive bid. Such contract
29 shall contain a promise by the certified business that the percentage of
30 employees that are individuals with disabilities will be maintained
31 throughout the contract term and a condition that the certified business
32 shall not subcontract for goods or services in an aggregate amount of more
33 than 25% of the total bid cost.
34 (c) The director of purchases shall have power to decide as to the
35 lowest responsible bidder for all purchases, but if:
36 (1) (A) A responsible bidder purchases from a qualified vendor goods
37 or services on the list certified by the director of purchases pursuant to
38 K.S.A. 75-3317 et seq., and amendments thereto, the dollar amount of
39 such purchases made during the previous fiscal year shall be deducted
40 from the original bid received from such bidder for the purpose of
41 determining the lowest responsible bid, except that such deduction shall
42 not exceed 10% of the original bid received from such bidder; or
43 (B) a responsible bidder purchases from a certified business the dollar

HB 2273—Am. by HC 16
1 amount of such purchases made during the previous fiscal year shall be
2 deducted from the original bid received from such bidder for the purpose
3 of determining the lowest responsible bid, except that such deduction shall
4 not exceed 10% of the original bid received from such bidder;
5 (2) the dollar amount of the bid received from the lowest responsible
6 bidder from within the state is identical to the dollar amount of the bid
7 received from the lowest responsible bidder from without the state, the
8 contract shall be awarded to the bidder from within the state; and
9 (3) in the case of bids for paper products specified in K.S.A. 75-
10 3740b, and amendments thereto, the dollar amounts of the bids received
11 from two or more lowest responsible bidders are identical, the contract
12 shall be awarded to the bidder whose bid is for those paper products
13 containing the highest percentage of recycled materials.
14 (d) (1) Any or all bids may be rejected, and a bid shall be rejected if it
15 contains any material alteration or erasure made after the bid is opened.
16 The director of purchases may reject the bid of any bidder who is in
17 arrears on taxes due the state, who is not properly registered to collect and
18 remit taxes due the state or who has failed to perform satisfactorily on a
19 previous contract with the state. The secretary of revenue is hereby
20 authorized to exchange such information with the director of purchases as
21 is necessary to effectuate the preceding sentence notwithstanding any other
22 provision of law prohibiting disclosure of the contents of taxpayer records
23 or information. Prior to determining the lowest responsible bidder on
24 contracts for construction of buildings or for major repairs or
25 improvements to buildings for state agencies, the director of purchases
26 shall consider the:
27 (A) Criteria and information developed by the secretary of
28 administration, with the advice of the state building advisory commission
29 to rate contractors on the basis of their performance under similar contracts
30 with the state, local governmental entities and private entities, in addition
31 to other criteria and information available; and
32 (B) recommendations of the project architect, or, if there is no project
33 architect, the recommendations of the secretary of administration or the
34 agency architect for the project as provided in K.S.A. 75-1254, and
35 amendments thereto.
36 (2) In any case where competitive bids are required and where all
37 bids are rejected, new bids shall be called for as in the first instance, unless
38 otherwise expressly provided by law or the state agency elects not to
39 proceed with the procurement.
40 (e) Before the awarding of any contract for construction of a building
41 or the making of repairs or improvements upon any building for a state
42 agency, the director of purchases shall receive written approval from the
43 state agency for which the building construction project has been

HB 2273—Am. by HC 17
1 approved, that the bids generally conform with the plans and specifications
2 prepared by the project architect, by the secretary of administration or by
3 the agency architect for the project, as the case may be, so as to avoid error
4 and mistake on the part of the contractors. In all cases where material
5 described in a contract can be obtained from any state institution, the
6 director of purchases shall exclude the same from the contract.
7 (f) All bids with the names of the bidders and the amounts thereof,
8 together with all documents pertaining to the award of a contract, shall be
9 made a part of a file or record and retained by the director of purchases for
10 five years, unless reproduced as provided in K.S.A. 75-3737, and

4 otherwise:
5 (a) "Income" means the sum of adjusted gross income under the
6 Kansas income tax act effective for tax year 2013 and thereafter without
7 regard to any modifications pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,117(b)(xx) through

27 disability payments received under the federal social security act.
28 (b) "Household" means a claimant, a claimant and spouse who
29 occupy the homestead or a claimant and one or more individuals not
30 related as husband and wife who together occupy a homestead.

32 a household in a calendar year while members of such household.
33 (d) "Homestead" means the dwelling, or any part thereof, owned and
34 occupied as a residence by the household and so much of the land
35 surrounding it, as defined as a home site for ad valorem tax purposes, and
36 may consist of a part of a multi-dwelling or multi-purpose building and a
37 part of the land upon which it is built or a manufactured home or mobile
38 home and the land upon which it is situated. "Owned" includes a vendee in
39 possession under a land contract, a life tenant, a beneficiary under a trust
40 and one or more joint tenants or tenants in common.
41 (e) "Claimant" means a person who has filed a claim under the
42 provisions of this act and was, during the entire calendar year preceding
43 the year in which such claim was filed for refund under this act, except as

HB 2273—Am. by HC 21
1 provided in K.S.A. 79-4503, and amendments thereto, both domiciled in
2 this state and was:
3 (1) For purposes of a claim under K.S.A. 79-4508, and amendments
4 thereto:

20 eligible to continue to receive benefits until such time the surviving spouse
21 remarries.
22 When a homestead is occupied by two or more individuals and more
23 than one of the individuals is able to qualify as a claimant, the individuals
24 may determine between them as to whom the claimant will be. If they are
25 unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the secretary of revenue
26 whose decision shall be final.

43 occupies two or more different homesteads in the same calendar year,

HB 2273—Am. by HC 22
1 property taxes accrued shall be the sum of the taxes allocable to those
2 several properties while occupied by the household as its homestead
3 during the year. Whenever a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit
4 such as a multi-purpose or multi-dwelling building, property taxes accrued
5 shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of
6 the homestead is of the total value. For the purpose of this act, the word
7 "unit" refers to that parcel of property covered by a single tax statement of
8 which the homestead is a part.
9 (g) "Disability" means:
10 (1) Inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of
11 any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be
12 expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a
13 continuous period of not less than 12 months, and an individual shall be
14 determined to be under a disability only if the physical or mental
15 impairment or impairments are of such severity that the individual is not
16 only unable to do the individual's previous work but cannot, considering
17 age, education and work experience, engage in any other kind of
18 substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless
19 of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which the individual
20 lives or whether a specific job vacancy exists for the individual, or whether
21 the individual would be hired if application was made for work. For
22 purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), "work
23 which exists in the national economy" means work which exists in
24 significant numbers either in the region where the individual lives or in
25 several regions of the country; for purposes of this subsection, a "physical
26 or mental impairment" is an impairment that results from anatomical,
27 physiological or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by
28 medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques; or

32 some regularity and over a substantial period of time.

200
34 better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied
35 by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the
36 visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be
37 considered for the purpose of this paragraph as having a central visual
38 acuity of 20/ or less.
200
39 (i) "Disabled veteran" means a person who is a resident of Kansas
40 and who:
41 (1) Served in the active military, naval, air or space service, including
42 those groups and individuals listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.7, and who was
43 discharged or released therefrom under an honorable discharge or a

HB 2273—Am. by HC 23
1 general discharge under honorable conditions;
2 (2) received a disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of
3 duty in the active military, naval, air or space service, including those
4 groups and individuals listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.7; and

6 than 50%, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. or 10 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq.
7 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-160, 8-1,221, 8-243, 8-1324, 32-934,
8 48-3601, 50-676, 73-201, 73-230, 73-1239, 73-1244, 75-3740 and 79-
9 4502 are hereby repealed.
10 Sec. 15. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
11 publication in the statute book.
