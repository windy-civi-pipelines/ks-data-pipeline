15
16 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
17 Section 1. K.S.A. 21-6810 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 21-6810. (a) Criminal history categories contained in the sentencing
19 guidelines grids are based on the following types of prior convictions:
20 Person felony adult convictions, nonperson felony adult convictions,
21 person felony juvenile adjudications, nonperson felony juvenile
22 adjudications, person misdemeanor adult convictions, nonperson class
23 A misdemeanor adult convictions, person misdemeanor juvenile
24 adjudications, nonperson class A misdemeanor juvenile adjudications,
25 select class B nonperson misdemeanor adult convictions, select class B
26 nonperson misdemeanor juvenile adjudications and convictions and
27 adjudications for violations of municipal ordinances or county
28 resolutions which that are comparable to any crime classified under
29 the state law of Kansas as a person misdemeanor, select nonperson
30 class B misdemeanor or nonperson class A misdemeanor. A prior
31 conviction is any conviction, other than another count in the current
32 case, which that was brought in the same information or complaint or
33 which was joined for trial with other counts in the current case
34 pursuant to K.S.A. 22-3203, and amendments thereto, which that
35 occurred prior to sentencing in the current case, regardless of whether
36 the offense that led to the prior conviction occurred before or after the
SB 186—Am. by HC 2
1 current offense or the conviction in the current case.
2 (b) A class B nonperson select misdemeanor is a special
3 classification established for weapons violations. Such classification
4 shall be considered and scored in determining an offender's criminal
5 history classification.
6 (c) Except as otherwise provided, all convictions, whether
7 sentenced consecutively or concurrently, shall be counted separately in
8 the offender's criminal history.
9 (d) Except as provided in K.S.A. 21-6815, and amendments
10 thereto, the following are applicable to determining an offender's
11 criminal history classification:
12 (1) Only verified convictions will be considered and scored.
13 (2) All prior adult felony convictions, including expungements,
14 will be considered and scored. Prior adult felony convictions for
15 offenses that were committed before July 1, 1993, shall be scored as a
16 person or nonperson crime using a comparable offense under the
17 Kansas criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of
18 conviction was committed.
19 (3) There will be no decay factor applicable for:
20 (A) Adult convictions;
21 (B) a juvenile adjudication for an offense committed before July
22 1, 1993, which would have been a class A, B or C felony, if committed
23 by an adult. Prior juvenile adjudications for offenses that were
24 committed before July 1, 1993, shall be scored as a person or
25 nonperson crime using a comparable offense under the Kansas
26 criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of conviction was
27 committed; or
28 (C) a juvenile adjudication for an offense committed on or after
29 July 1, 1993, which would be an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity
30 level 1 through 4 felony, if committed by an adult.
31 (4) Except as otherwise provided, a juvenile adjudication will
32 decay if the current crime of conviction is committed after the
33 offender reaches the age of 25, and the juvenile adjudication is for an
34 offense:
35 (A) Committed before July 1, 1993, which would have been a
36 class D or E felony, if committed by an adult;
37 (B) committed on or after July 1, 1993, which would be a
38 nondrug severity level 5 through 10 felony, a nongrid felony or any
39 drug felony, if committed by an adult; or
40 (C) which would be a misdemeanor, if committed by an adult.
41 (5) A juvenile adjudication will not be considered and scored if:
42 (A) The current crime of conviction is committed at least five
43 years after the date of the prior adjudication;
SB 186—Am. by HC 3
1 (B) the offender has no new adjudications or convictions during
2 such five-year period; and
3 (C) the juvenile adjudication is for an offense that would be a
4 nondrug severity level 5 through 10 felony, drug felony, nongrid felony
5 or misdemeanor, if committed by an adult.
6 (6) All person misdemeanors, class A nonperson misdemeanors
7 and class B select nonperson misdemeanors, and all municipal
8 ordinance and county resolution violations comparable to such
9 misdemeanors, shall be considered and scored. Prior misdemeanors
10 for offenses that were committed before July 1, 1993, shall be scored
11 as a person or nonperson crime using a comparable offense under the
12 Kansas criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of
13 conviction was committed.
14 (7) Unless otherwise provided by law, unclassified felonies and
15 misdemeanors, shall be considered and scored as nonperson crimes
16 for the purpose of determining criminal history.
17 (8) Prior convictions of a crime defined by a statute that has since
18 been repealed shall be scored using the classification assigned at the
19 time of such conviction.
20 (9) Prior convictions of a crime defined by a statute that has since
21 been determined unconstitutional by an appellate court shall not be
22 used for criminal history scoring purposes unless the basis of the
23 determination of unconstitutionality by the appellate court is later
24 overruled or reversed by an order or opinion of the supreme court of the
25 state of Kansas or the United States supreme court.
26 (10) Prior convictions of any crime shall not be counted in
27 determining the criminal history category if they enhance the severity
28 level, elevate the classification from misdemeanor to felony, or are
29 elements of the present crime of conviction. Except as otherwise
30 provided, all other prior convictions will be considered and scored.
31 (e) The amendments made to this section by section 1 of chapter 5
32 of the 2015 Session Laws of Kansas are procedural in nature and shall
33 be construed and applied retroactively.
34 Section 1.Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-2302 is hereby amended to read as
35 follows: 22-2302. (a) (1) If the magistrate finds from the complaint, or
36 from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint or from sworn
37 testimony, that there is probable cause to believe both that a crime has
38 been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the
39 arrest of the defendant shall issue, except that a summons instead of a
40 warrant may be issued if:
41 (1)(A) The prosecuting attorney so requests; or
42 (2)(B) in the case of a complaint alleging commission of a
43 misdemeanor, the magistrate determines that a summons should be issued.
SB 186—Am. by HC 4
1 (2) More than one warrant or summons may issue on the same
2 complaint. If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a
3 warrant shall issue.
4 (b) For a warrant or summons executed prior to July 1, 2014,
5 affidavits or sworn testimony in support of the probable cause requirement
6 of this section shall not be made available for examination without a
7 written order of the court, except that such affidavits or testimony when
8 requested shall be made available to the defendant or the defendant's
9 counsel for such disposition as either may desire.
10 (c) (1) For a warrant or summons executed on or after July 1, 2014,
11 Affidavits or sworn testimony in support of the probable cause
12 requirement of this section shall be made available to law enforcement
13 agencies prior to execution of the warrant or summons, but shall not be
14 open to the general public until the warrant or summons has been
15 executed. After the warrant or summons has been executed, such affidavits
16 or sworn testimony shall be made available to:
17 (A) The defendant or the defendant's counsel, when requested, for
18 such disposition as either may desire; and
19 (B) any person, when requested, in accordance with the requirements
20 of this subsection.
21 (2) Any person may request that affidavits or sworn testimony be
22 disclosed by filing such request with the clerk of the court. Upon entry of
23 appearance by an attorney on behalf of the defendant, or indication by the
24 defendant to the court that such defendant will represent the defendant's
25 self, the clerk of the court shall promptly notify the defendant or the
26 defendant's counsel, the prosecutor and the magistrate that such request
27 was filed. The prosecutor shall promptly notify any victim. For the
28 purposes of this subsection, victim shall include any victim of an alleged
29 crime that resulted in the issuance of the arrest warrant, or, if the victim is
30 deceased, the victim's family, as defined in K.S.A. 74-7335, and
31 amendments thereto.
32 (3) Within five business days after receiving notice of a request for
33 disclosure from the clerk of the court, the defendant or the defendant's
34 counsel and the prosecutor may submit to the magistrate, under seal,
35 either:
36 (A) Proposed redactions, if any, to the affidavits or sworn testimony
37 and the reasons supporting such proposed redactions; or
38 (B) a motion to seal the affidavits or sworn testimony and the reasons
39 supporting such proposed seal.
40 (4) The magistrate shall review the requested affidavits or sworn
41 testimony and any proposed redactions or motion to seal submitted by the
42 defendant, the defendant's counsel or the prosecutor. The magistrate shall
43 make appropriate redactions, or seal the affidavits or sworn testimony, as
SB 186—Am. by HC 5
1 necessary to prevent public disclosure of information that would:
2 (A) Jeopardize the physical, mental or emotional safety or well-being
3 of a victim, witness, confidential source or undercover agent, or cause the
4 destruction of evidence;
5 (B) reveal information obtained from a court-ordered wiretap or from
6 a search warrant for a tracking device that has not expired;
7 (C) interfere with any prospective law enforcement action, criminal
8 investigation or prosecution;
9 (D) reveal the identity of any confidential source or undercover agent;
10 (E) reveal confidential investigative techniques or procedures not
11 known to the general public;
12 (F) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;
13 (G) reveal the name, address, telephone number or any other
14 information which specifically and individually identifies the victim of any
15 sexual offense described in article 35 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes
16 Annotated, prior to their repeal, or article 55 of chapter 21 of the Kansas
17 Statutes Annotated or K.S.A. 21-6419 through 21-6422, and amendments
18 thereto;
19 (H) reveal the name of any minor;
20 (I) reveal any date of birth, personal or business telephone number,
21 driver's license number, nondriver's identification number, social security
22 number, employee identification number, taxpayer identification number,
23 vehicle identification number or financial account information; or
24 (J) constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. As
25 used in this subparagraph, "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
26 privacy" means revealing information that would be highly offensive to a
27 reasonable person and is totally unrelated to the alleged crime that resulted
28 in the issuance of the arrest warrant, including information totally
29 unrelated to the alleged crime that may pose a risk to a person or property
30 and is not of legitimate concern to the public. The provisions of this
31 subparagraph shall only be used to redact and shall not be used to seal
32 affidavits or sworn testimony.
33 (5) Within five business days after receiving proposed redactions or a
34 motion to seal from the defendant, the defendant's counsel or the
35 prosecutor, or within 10 business days after receiving notice of a request
36 for disclosure, whichever is earlier, the magistrate shall either:
37 (A) Order disclosure of the affidavits or sworn testimony with
38 appropriate redactions, if any; or
39 (B) order the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed and not subject to
40 public disclosure.
41 (6) (A) If the magistrate orders disclosure of the affidavits or sworn
42 testimony with appropriate redactions, if any, to any person in accordance
43 with the requirements of this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn
SB 186—Am. by HC 6
1 testimony shall become part of the court record and shall be accessible to
2 the public.
3 (B) If the magistrate orders the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed
4 and not subject to public disclosure in accordance with the requirements of
5 this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn testimony shall become part
6 of the court record that is not accessible to the public.
7 (C) Any request for disclosure of affidavits or sworn testimony in
8 accordance with the requirements of this subsection shall become part of
9 the court record and shall be accessible to the public, regardless of whether
10 the magistrate orders disclosure with appropriate redactions, if any, or
11 sealing of the requested affidavit or sworn testimony.
12 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 22-2802 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
13 2802. (1)(a) Any person charged with a crime shall, at the person's
14 first appearance before a magistrate, be ordered released pending
15 preliminary examination or trial upon the execution of an appearance
16 bond in an amount specified by the magistrate and sufficient to assure
17 the appearance of such person before the magistrate when ordered
18 and to assure the public safety. If the person is being bound over for a
19 felony, the bond shall also be conditioned on the person's appearance
20 in the district court or by way of a two-way electronic audio-video
21 communication as provided in subsection (14) (n) at the time required
22 by the court to answer the charge against such person and at any time
23 thereafter that the court requires. Unless the magistrate makes a
24 specific finding otherwise, if the person is being bonded out for a
25 person felony or a person misdemeanor, the bond shall be conditioned
26 on the person being prohibited from having any contact with the
27 alleged victim of such offense for a period of at least 72 hours. The
28 magistrate may impose such of the following additional conditions of
29 release as will reasonably assure the appearance of the person for
30 preliminary examination or trial:
31 (a)(1) Place the person in the custody of a designated person or
32 organization agreeing to supervise such person;
33 (b)(2) place restrictions on the travel, association or place of
34 abode of the person during the period of release;
35 (c)(3) impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary to
36 assure appearance as required, including a condition requiring that
37 the person return to custody during specified hours;
38 (d)(4) place the person under a house arrest program pursuant to
39 K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto; or
40 (e)(5) place the person under the supervision of a court services
41 officer responsible for monitoring the person's compliance with any
42 conditions of release ordered by the magistrate. The magistrate may
43 order the person to pay for any costs associated with the supervision
SB 186—Am. by HC 7
1 provided by the court services department in an amount not to exceed
2 $15 per week of such supervision. The magistrate may also order the
3 person to pay for all other costs associated with the supervision and
4 conditions for compliance in addition to the $15 per week.
5 (2)(b) In addition to any conditions of release provided in
6 subsection (1) (a), for any person charged with a felony, the magistrate
7 may order such person to submit to a drug and alcohol abuse
8 examination and evaluation in a public or private treatment facility or
9 state institution and, if determined by the head of such facility or
10 institution that such person is a drug or alcohol abuser or is
11 incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, to submit to treatment for such
12 drug or alcohol abuse, as a condition of release.
13 (3)(c) The appearance bond shall be executed with sufficient
14 solvent sureties who are residents of the state of Kansas, unless the
15 magistrate determines, in the exercise of such magistrate's discretion,
16 that requiring sureties is not necessary to assure the appearance of the
17 person at the time ordered.
18 (4)(d) A deposit of cash in the amount of the bond may be made
19 in lieu of the execution of the bond pursuant to subsection (3) (c).
20 Except as provided in subsection (5)(e), such deposit shall be in the full
21 amount of the bond and in no event shall a deposit of cash in less than
22 the full amount of bond be permitted. Any person charged with a
23 crime who is released on a cash bond shall be entitled to a refund of all
24 moneys paid for the cash bond, after deduction of any outstanding
25 restitution, costs, fines and fees, after the final disposition of the
26 criminal case if the person complies with all requirements to appear in
27 court. The court may not exclude the option of posting bond pursuant
28 to subsection (3) (c).
29 (5)(e) Except as provided further, the amount of the appearance
30 bond shall be the same whether executed as described in subsection (3)
31 (c) or posted with a deposit of cash as described in subsection (4) (d).
32 When the appearance bond has been set at $2,500 or less and the most
33 serious charge against the person is a misdemeanor, a severity level 8,
34 9 or 10 nonperson felony, a drug severity level 4 felony committed
35 prior to July 1, 2012, a drug severity level 5 felony committed on or
36 after July 1, 2012, or a violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and amendments
37 thereto, the magistrate may allow the person to deposit cash with the
38 clerk in the amount of 10% of the bond, provided the person meets at
39 least the following qualifications:
40 (A)(1) Is a resident of the state of Kansas;
41 (B)(2) has a criminal history score category of G, H or I;
42 (C)(3) has no prior history of failure to appear for any court
43 appearances;
SB 186—Am. by HC 8
1 (D)(4) has no detainer or hold from any other jurisdiction;
2 (E)(5) has not been extradited from, and is not awaiting
3 extradition to, another state; and
4 (F)(6) has not been detained for an alleged violation of probation.
5 (6)(f) In the discretion of the court, a person charged with a crime
6 may be released upon the person's own recognizance by guaranteeing
7 payment of the amount of the bond for the person's failure to comply
8 with all requirements to appear in court. The release of a person
9 charged with a crime upon the person's own recognizance shall not
10 require the deposit of any cash by the person.
11 (7)(g) The court shall not impose any administrative fee.
12 (8)(h) In determining which conditions of release will reasonably
13 assure appearance and the public safety, the magistrate shall, on the
14 basis of available information, take into account the nature and
15 circumstances of the crime charged; the weight of the evidence against
16 the defendant; whether the defendant is lawfully present in the United
17 States; the defendant's family ties, employment, financial resources,
18 character, mental condition, length of residence in the community,
19 record of convictions, record of appearance or failure to appear at
20 court proceedings or of flight to avoid prosecution; the likelihood or
21 propensity of the defendant to commit crimes while on release,
22 including whether the defendant will be likely to threaten, harass or
23 cause injury to the victim of the crime or any witnesses thereto; and
24 whether the defendant is on probation or parole from a previous
25 offense at the time of the alleged commission of the subsequent
26 offense.
27 (9)(i) The appearance bond shall set forth all of the conditions of
28 release.
29 (10)(j) A person for whom conditions of release are imposed and
30 who continues to be detained as a result of the person's inability to
31 meet the conditions of release shall be entitled, upon application, to
32 have the conditions reviewed without unnecessary delay by the
33 magistrate who imposed them. If the magistrate who imposed
34 conditions of release is not available, any other magistrate in the
35 county may review such conditions.
36 (11)(k) A magistrate ordering the release of a person on any
37 conditions specified in this section may at any time amend the order to
38 impose additional or different conditions of release. If the imposition
39 of additional or different conditions results in the detention of the
40 person, the provisions of subsection (10) (j) shall apply.
41 (12)(l) Statements or information offered in determining the
42 conditions of release need not conform to the rules of evidence. No
43 statement or admission of the defendant made at such a proceeding
SB 186—Am. by HC 9
1 shall be received as evidence in any subsequent proceeding against the
2 defendant.
3 (13)(m) The appearance bond and any security required as a
4 condition of the defendant's release shall be deposited in the office of
5 the magistrate or the clerk of the court where the release is ordered. If
6 the defendant is bound to appear before a magistrate or court other
7 than the one ordering the release, the order of release, together with
8 the bond and security shall be transmitted to the magistrate or clerk
9 of the court before whom the defendant is bound to appear.
10 (14)(n) Proceedings before a magistrate as provided in this section
11 to determine the release conditions of a person charged with a crime
12 including release upon execution of an appearance bond may be
13 conducted by two-way electronic audio-video communication between
14 the defendant and the judge in lieu of personal presence of the
15 defendant or defendant's counsel in the courtroom in the discretion of
16 the court. The defendant may be accompanied by the defendant's
17 counsel. The defendant shall be informed of the defendant's right to be
18 personally present in the courtroom during such proceeding if the
19 defendant so requests. Exercising the right to be present shall in no
20 way prejudice the defendant.
21 (15)(o) The magistrate may order the person to pay for any costs
22 associated with the supervision of the conditions of release of the
23 appearance bond in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of such
24 supervision. As a condition of sentencing under K.S.A. 21-6604, and
25 amendments thereto, the court may impose the full amount of any
26 such costs in addition to the $15 per week, including, but not limited
27 to, costs for treatment and evaluation under subsection (2) (b).
28 (p) (1) If a defendant is charged with rape, as described in K.S.A. 21-
29 5503, and amendments thereto, criminal sodomy or aggravated criminal
30 sodomy, as described in K.S.A. 21-5504, and amendments thereto,
31 aggravated sexual battery, as described in K.S.A. 21-5505, and
32 amendments thereto, or indecent liberties with a child or aggravated
33 indecent liberties with a child, as described in K.S.A. 21-5506, and
34 amendments thereto, the magistrate shall determine prior convictions of
35 such offenses or comparable out-of-state convictions upon available
36 evidence.
37 (2) If the magistrate determines that such defendant has a prior
38 conviction of any crime that constitutes a sexually violent crime as defined
39 in K.S.A. 22-4902, and amendments thereto, bond shall be at least
40 $750,000 cash or surety and have at least minimum conditions of no
41 contact with any victims or witnesses and the magistrate shall place the
42 person under a house arrest program pursuant to subsection (a)(4). Such
43 bond shall not be reduced or modified downward unless the magistrate
SB 186—Am. by HC 10
1 determines by a preponderance of the evidence at an evidentiary hearing
2 and makes a written finding on the record that the defendant is not a
3 public safety risk and not a flight risk. At such evidentiary hearing, there
4 shall be a presumption that the defendant is both a public safety risk and a
5 flight risk.
6 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 22-2803 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
7 2803. A person who remains in custody after review of such person's
8 application pursuant to subsection (9) or (10) of K.S.A. 22-2802(i) or
9 (j), and amendments thereto, by a district magistrate judge may apply
10 to a district judge of the judicial district in which the charge is
11 pending to modify the order fixing conditions of release. Such motion
12 shall be determined promptly.
13 Sec. 2. 5. K.S.A. 21-6810, 22-2302 is, 22-2802 and 22-2803 are
14 hereby repealed.
15 Sec. 3. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
16 publication in the statute book.

By Committee on Judiciary
2-4
1 AN ACT concerning crimes, punishment and criminal procedure;
2 relating to sentencing; providing that prior convictions of a crime
3 defined by a statute that has since been determined
4 unconstitutional by an appellate court shall not be used for
5 criminal history scoring purposes unless the basis of the
6 determination of unconstitutionality by the appellate court is later
7 overruled or reversed; relating to affidavits or sworn testimony in
8 support of probable cause; requiring such information to be made
9 available to law enforcement; relating to release prior to trial;
10 requiring that certain prior convictions be considered when bond is
11 being set for certain sex offenses; specifying minimum

13 6810, 22-2302, 22-2802 and 22-2803 and repealing the existing section
14 sections.
15
16 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
17 Section 1. K.S.A. 21-6810 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 21-6810. (a) Criminal history categories contained in the sentencing
19 guidelines grids are based on the following types of prior convictions:
20 Person felony adult convictions, nonperson felony adult convictions,
21 person felony juvenile adjudications, nonperson felony juvenile
22 adjudications, person misdemeanor adult convictions, nonperson class
23 A misdemeanor adult convictions, person misdemeanor juvenile
24 adjudications, nonperson class A misdemeanor juvenile adjudications,
25 select class B nonperson misdemeanor adult convictions, select class B
26 nonperson misdemeanor juvenile adjudications and convictions and
27 adjudications for violations of municipal ordinances or county
28 resolutions which that are comparable to any crime classified under
29 the state law of Kansas as a person misdemeanor, select nonperson
30 class B misdemeanor or nonperson class A misdemeanor. A prior
31 conviction is any conviction, other than another count in the current
32 case, which that was brought in the same information or complaint or
33 which was joined for trial with other counts in the current case
34 pursuant to K.S.A. 22-3203, and amendments thereto, which that
35 occurred prior to sentencing in the current case, regardless of whether
36 the offense that led to the prior conviction occurred before or after the

SB 186—Am. by HC 2
1 current offense or the conviction in the current case.
2 (b) A class B nonperson select misdemeanor is a special
3 classification established for weapons violations. Such classification
4 shall be considered and scored in determining an offender's criminal
5 history classification.
6 (c) Except as otherwise provided, all convictions, whether
7 sentenced consecutively or concurrently, shall be counted separately in
8 the offender's criminal history.
9 (d) Except as provided in K.S.A. 21-6815, and amendments
10 thereto, the following are applicable to determining an offender's
11 criminal history classification:
12 (1) Only verified convictions will be considered and scored.
13 (2) All prior adult felony convictions, including expungements,
14 will be considered and scored. Prior adult felony convictions for
15 offenses that were committed before July 1, 1993, shall be scored as a
16 person or nonperson crime using a comparable offense under the
17 Kansas criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of
18 conviction was committed.
19 (3) There will be no decay factor applicable for:
20 (A) Adult convictions;
21 (B) a juvenile adjudication for an offense committed before July
22 1, 1993, which would have been a class A, B or C felony, if committed
23 by an adult. Prior juvenile adjudications for offenses that were
24 committed before July 1, 1993, shall be scored as a person or
25 nonperson crime using a comparable offense under the Kansas
26 criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of conviction was
27 committed; or
28 (C) a juvenile adjudication for an offense committed on or after
29 July 1, 1993, which would be an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity
30 level 1 through 4 felony, if committed by an adult.
31 (4) Except as otherwise provided, a juvenile adjudication will
32 decay if the current crime of conviction is committed after the
33 offender reaches the age of 25, and the juvenile adjudication is for an
34 offense:
35 (A) Committed before July 1, 1993, which would have been a
36 class D or E felony, if committed by an adult;
37 (B) committed on or after July 1, 1993, which would be a
38 nondrug severity level 5 through 10 felony, a nongrid felony or any
39 drug felony, if committed by an adult; or
40 (C) which would be a misdemeanor, if committed by an adult.
41 (5) A juvenile adjudication will not be considered and scored if:
42 (A) The current crime of conviction is committed at least five
43 years after the date of the prior adjudication;

SB 186—Am. by HC 3
1 (B) the offender has no new adjudications or convictions during
2 such five-year period; and
3 (C) the juvenile adjudication is for an offense that would be a
4 nondrug severity level 5 through 10 felony, drug felony, nongrid felony
5 or misdemeanor, if committed by an adult.
6 (6) All person misdemeanors, class A nonperson misdemeanors
7 and class B select nonperson misdemeanors, and all municipal
8 ordinance and county resolution violations comparable to such
9 misdemeanors, shall be considered and scored. Prior misdemeanors
10 for offenses that were committed before July 1, 1993, shall be scored
11 as a person or nonperson crime using a comparable offense under the
12 Kansas criminal code in effect on the date the current crime of
13 conviction was committed.
14 (7) Unless otherwise provided by law, unclassified felonies and
15 misdemeanors, shall be considered and scored as nonperson crimes
16 for the purpose of determining criminal history.
17 (8) Prior convictions of a crime defined by a statute that has since
18 been repealed shall be scored using the classification assigned at the
19 time of such conviction.
20 (9) Prior convictions of a crime defined by a statute that has since
21 been determined unconstitutional by an appellate court shall not be
22 used for criminal history scoring purposes unless the basis of the
23 determination of unconstitutionality by the appellate court is later
24 overruled or reversed by an order or opinion of the supreme court of the
25 state of Kansas or the United States supreme court.
26 (10) Prior convictions of any crime shall not be counted in
27 determining the criminal history category if they enhance the severity
28 level, elevate the classification from misdemeanor to felony, or are
29 elements of the present crime of conviction. Except as otherwise
30 provided, all other prior convictions will be considered and scored.
31 (e) The amendments made to this section by section 1 of chapter 5
32 of the 2015 Session Laws of Kansas are procedural in nature and shall
33 be construed and applied retroactively.
34 Section 1.Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-2302 is hereby amended to read as
35 follows: 22-2302. (a) (1) If the magistrate finds from the complaint, or
36 from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint or from sworn
37 testimony, that there is probable cause to believe both that a crime has
38 been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the
39 arrest of the defendant shall issue, except that a summons instead of a
40 warrant may be issued if:
41 (1)(A) The prosecuting attorney so requests; or
42 (2)(B) in the case of a complaint alleging commission of a
43 misdemeanor, the magistrate determines that a summons should be issued.

SB 186—Am. by HC 4
1 (2) More than one warrant or summons may issue on the same
2 complaint. If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons, a
3 warrant shall issue.
4 (b) For a warrant or summons executed prior to July 1, 2014,
5 affidavits or sworn testimony in support of the probable cause requirement
6 of this section shall not be made available for examination without a
7 written order of the court, except that such affidavits or testimony when
8 requested shall be made available to the defendant or the defendant's
9 counsel for such disposition as either may desire.
10 (c) (1) For a warrant or summons executed on or after July 1, 2014,
11 Affidavits or sworn testimony in support of the probable cause
12 requirement of this section shall be made available to law enforcement
13 agencies prior to execution of the warrant or summons, but shall not be
14 open to the general public until the warrant or summons has been
15 executed. After the warrant or summons has been executed, such affidavits
16 or sworn testimony shall be made available to:
17 (A) The defendant or the defendant's counsel, when requested, for
18 such disposition as either may desire; and
19 (B) any person, when requested, in accordance with the requirements
20 of this subsection.
21 (2) Any person may request that affidavits or sworn testimony be
22 disclosed by filing such request with the clerk of the court. Upon entry of
23 appearance by an attorney on behalf of the defendant, or indication by the
24 defendant to the court that such defendant will represent the defendant's
25 self, the clerk of the court shall promptly notify the defendant or the
26 defendant's counsel, the prosecutor and the magistrate that such request
27 was filed. The prosecutor shall promptly notify any victim. For the
28 purposes of this subsection, victim shall include any victim of an alleged
29 crime that resulted in the issuance of the arrest warrant, or, if the victim is
30 deceased, the victim's family, as defined in K.S.A. 74-7335, and
31 amendments thereto.
32 (3) Within five business days after receiving notice of a request for
33 disclosure from the clerk of the court, the defendant or the defendant's
34 counsel and the prosecutor may submit to the magistrate, under seal,
35 either:
36 (A) Proposed redactions, if any, to the affidavits or sworn testimony
37 and the reasons supporting such proposed redactions; or
38 (B) a motion to seal the affidavits or sworn testimony and the reasons
39 supporting such proposed seal.
40 (4) The magistrate shall review the requested affidavits or sworn
41 testimony and any proposed redactions or motion to seal submitted by the
42 defendant, the defendant's counsel or the prosecutor. The magistrate shall
43 make appropriate redactions, or seal the affidavits or sworn testimony, as

SB 186—Am. by HC 5
1 necessary to prevent public disclosure of information that would:
2 (A) Jeopardize the physical, mental or emotional safety or well-being
3 of a victim, witness, confidential source or undercover agent, or cause the
4 destruction of evidence;
5 (B) reveal information obtained from a court-ordered wiretap or from
6 a search warrant for a tracking device that has not expired;
7 (C) interfere with any prospective law enforcement action, criminal
8 investigation or prosecution;
9 (D) reveal the identity of any confidential source or undercover agent;
10 (E) reveal confidential investigative techniques or procedures not
11 known to the general public;
12 (F) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;
13 (G) reveal the name, address, telephone number or any other
14 information which specifically and individually identifies the victim of any
15 sexual offense described in article 35 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes
16 Annotated, prior to their repeal, or article 55 of chapter 21 of the Kansas
17 Statutes Annotated or K.S.A. 21-6419 through 21-6422, and amendments
18 thereto;
19 (H) reveal the name of any minor;
20 (I) reveal any date of birth, personal or business telephone number,
21 driver's license number, nondriver's identification number, social security
22 number, employee identification number, taxpayer identification number,
23 vehicle identification number or financial account information; or
24 (J) constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. As
25 used in this subparagraph, "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
26 privacy" means revealing information that would be highly offensive to a
27 reasonable person and is totally unrelated to the alleged crime that resulted
28 in the issuance of the arrest warrant, including information totally
29 unrelated to the alleged crime that may pose a risk to a person or property
30 and is not of legitimate concern to the public. The provisions of this
31 subparagraph shall only be used to redact and shall not be used to seal
32 affidavits or sworn testimony.
33 (5) Within five business days after receiving proposed redactions or a
34 motion to seal from the defendant, the defendant's counsel or the
35 prosecutor, or within 10 business days after receiving notice of a request
36 for disclosure, whichever is earlier, the magistrate shall either:
37 (A) Order disclosure of the affidavits or sworn testimony with
38 appropriate redactions, if any; or
39 (B) order the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed and not subject to
40 public disclosure.
41 (6) (A) If the magistrate orders disclosure of the affidavits or sworn
42 testimony with appropriate redactions, if any, to any person in accordance
43 with the requirements of this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn

SB 186—Am. by HC 6
1 testimony shall become part of the court record and shall be accessible to
2 the public.
3 (B) If the magistrate orders the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed
4 and not subject to public disclosure in accordance with the requirements of
5 this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn testimony shall become part
6 of the court record that is not accessible to the public.
7 (C) Any request for disclosure of affidavits or sworn testimony in
8 accordance with the requirements of this subsection shall become part of
9 the court record and shall be accessible to the public, regardless of whether
10 the magistrate orders disclosure with appropriate redactions, if any, or
11 sealing of the requested affidavit or sworn testimony.
12 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 22-2802 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
13 2802. (1)(a) Any person charged with a crime shall, at the person's
14 first appearance before a magistrate, be ordered released pending
15 preliminary examination or trial upon the execution of an appearance
16 bond in an amount specified by the magistrate and sufficient to assure
17 the appearance of such person before the magistrate when ordered
18 and to assure the public safety. If the person is being bound over for a
19 felony, the bond shall also be conditioned on the person's appearance
20 in the district court or by way of a two-way electronic audio-video
21 communication as provided in subsection (14) (n) at the time required
22 by the court to answer the charge against such person and at any time
23 thereafter that the court requires. Unless the magistrate makes a
24 specific finding otherwise, if the person is being bonded out for a
25 person felony or a person misdemeanor, the bond shall be conditioned
26 on the person being prohibited from having any contact with the
27 alleged victim of such offense for a period of at least 72 hours. The
28 magistrate may impose such of the following additional conditions of
29 release as will reasonably assure the appearance of the person for
30 preliminary examination or trial:
31 (a)(1) Place the person in the custody of a designated person or
32 organization agreeing to supervise such person;
33 (b)(2) place restrictions on the travel, association or place of
34 abode of the person during the period of release;
35 (c)(3) impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary to
36 assure appearance as required, including a condition requiring that
37 the person return to custody during specified hours;
38 (d)(4) place the person under a house arrest program pursuant to
39 K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto; or
40 (e)(5) place the person under the supervision of a court services
41 officer responsible for monitoring the person's compliance with any
42 conditions of release ordered by the magistrate. The magistrate may
43 order the person to pay for any costs associated with the supervision

SB 186—Am. by HC 7
1 provided by the court services department in an amount not to exceed
2 $15 per week of such supervision. The magistrate may also order the
3 person to pay for all other costs associated with the supervision and
4 conditions for compliance in addition to the $15 per week.
5 (2)(b) In addition to any conditions of release provided in
6 subsection (1) (a), for any person charged with a felony, the magistrate
7 may order such person to submit to a drug and alcohol abuse
8 examination and evaluation in a public or private treatment facility or
9 state institution and, if determined by the head of such facility or
10 institution that such person is a drug or alcohol abuser or is
11 incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, to submit to treatment for such
12 drug or alcohol abuse, as a condition of release.
13 (3)(c) The appearance bond shall be executed with sufficient
14 solvent sureties who are residents of the state of Kansas, unless the
15 magistrate determines, in the exercise of such magistrate's discretion,
16 that requiring sureties is not necessary to assure the appearance of the
17 person at the time ordered.
18 (4)(d) A deposit of cash in the amount of the bond may be made
19 in lieu of the execution of the bond pursuant to subsection (3) (c).
20 Except as provided in subsection (5)(e), such deposit shall be in the full
21 amount of the bond and in no event shall a deposit of cash in less than
22 the full amount of bond be permitted. Any person charged with a
23 crime who is released on a cash bond shall be entitled to a refund of all
24 moneys paid for the cash bond, after deduction of any outstanding
25 restitution, costs, fines and fees, after the final disposition of the
26 criminal case if the person complies with all requirements to appear in
27 court. The court may not exclude the option of posting bond pursuant
28 to subsection (3) (c).
29 (5)(e) Except as provided further, the amount of the appearance
30 bond shall be the same whether executed as described in subsection (3)
31 (c) or posted with a deposit of cash as described in subsection (4) (d).
32 When the appearance bond has been set at $2,500 or less and the most
33 serious charge against the person is a misdemeanor, a severity level 8,
34 9 or 10 nonperson felony, a drug severity level 4 felony committed
35 prior to July 1, 2012, a drug severity level 5 felony committed on or
36 after July 1, 2012, or a violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and amendments
37 thereto, the magistrate may allow the person to deposit cash with the
38 clerk in the amount of 10% of the bond, provided the person meets at
39 least the following qualifications:
40 (A)(1) Is a resident of the state of Kansas;
41 (B)(2) has a criminal history score category of G, H or I;
42 (C)(3) has no prior history of failure to appear for any court
43 appearances;

SB 186—Am. by HC 8
1 (D)(4) has no detainer or hold from any other jurisdiction;
2 (E)(5) has not been extradited from, and is not awaiting
3 extradition to, another state; and
4 (F)(6) has not been detained for an alleged violation of probation.
5 (6)(f) In the discretion of the court, a person charged with a crime
6 may be released upon the person's own recognizance by guaranteeing
7 payment of the amount of the bond for the person's failure to comply
8 with all requirements to appear in court. The release of a person
9 charged with a crime upon the person's own recognizance shall not
10 require the deposit of any cash by the person.
11 (7)(g) The court shall not impose any administrative fee.
12 (8)(h) In determining which conditions of release will reasonably
13 assure appearance and the public safety, the magistrate shall, on the
14 basis of available information, take into account the nature and
15 circumstances of the crime charged; the weight of the evidence against
16 the defendant; whether the defendant is lawfully present in the United
17 States; the defendant's family ties, employment, financial resources,
18 character, mental condition, length of residence in the community,
19 record of convictions, record of appearance or failure to appear at
20 court proceedings or of flight to avoid prosecution; the likelihood or
21 propensity of the defendant to commit crimes while on release,
22 including whether the defendant will be likely to threaten, harass or
23 cause injury to the victim of the crime or any witnesses thereto; and
24 whether the defendant is on probation or parole from a previous
25 offense at the time of the alleged commission of the subsequent
26 offense.
27 (9)(i) The appearance bond shall set forth all of the conditions of
28 release.
29 (10)(j) A person for whom conditions of release are imposed and
30 who continues to be detained as a result of the person's inability to
31 meet the conditions of release shall be entitled, upon application, to
32 have the conditions reviewed without unnecessary delay by the
33 magistrate who imposed them. If the magistrate who imposed
34 conditions of release is not available, any other magistrate in the
35 county may review such conditions.
36 (11)(k) A magistrate ordering the release of a person on any
37 conditions specified in this section may at any time amend the order to
38 impose additional or different conditions of release. If the imposition
39 of additional or different conditions results in the detention of the
40 person, the provisions of subsection (10) (j) shall apply.
41 (12)(l) Statements or information offered in determining the
42 conditions of release need not conform to the rules of evidence. No
43 statement or admission of the defendant made at such a proceeding

SB 186—Am. by HC 9
1 shall be received as evidence in any subsequent proceeding against the
2 defendant.
3 (13)(m) The appearance bond and any security required as a
4 condition of the defendant's release shall be deposited in the office of
5 the magistrate or the clerk of the court where the release is ordered. If
6 the defendant is bound to appear before a magistrate or court other
7 than the one ordering the release, the order of release, together with
8 the bond and security shall be transmitted to the magistrate or clerk
9 of the court before whom the defendant is bound to appear.
10 (14)(n) Proceedings before a magistrate as provided in this section
11 to determine the release conditions of a person charged with a crime
12 including release upon execution of an appearance bond may be
13 conducted by two-way electronic audio-video communication between
14 the defendant and the judge in lieu of personal presence of the
15 defendant or defendant's counsel in the courtroom in the discretion of
16 the court. The defendant may be accompanied by the defendant's
17 counsel. The defendant shall be informed of the defendant's right to be
18 personally present in the courtroom during such proceeding if the
19 defendant so requests. Exercising the right to be present shall in no
20 way prejudice the defendant.
21 (15)(o) The magistrate may order the person to pay for any costs
22 associated with the supervision of the conditions of release of the
23 appearance bond in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of such
24 supervision. As a condition of sentencing under K.S.A. 21-6604, and
25 amendments thereto, the court may impose the full amount of any
26 such costs in addition to the $15 per week, including, but not limited
27 to, costs for treatment and evaluation under subsection (2) (b).
28 (p) (1) If a defendant is charged with rape, as described in K.S.A. 21-
29 5503, and amendments thereto, criminal sodomy or aggravated criminal
30 sodomy, as described in K.S.A. 21-5504, and amendments thereto,
31 aggravated sexual battery, as described in K.S.A. 21-5505, and
32 amendments thereto, or indecent liberties with a child or aggravated
33 indecent liberties with a child, as described in K.S.A. 21-5506, and
34 amendments thereto, the magistrate shall determine prior convictions of
35 such offenses or comparable out-of-state convictions upon available
36 evidence.
37 (2) If the magistrate determines that such defendant has a prior
38 conviction of any crime that constitutes a sexually violent crime as defined
39 in K.S.A. 22-4902, and amendments thereto, bond shall be at least
40 $750,000 cash or surety and have at least minimum conditions of no
41 contact with any victims or witnesses and the magistrate shall place the
42 person under a house arrest program pursuant to subsection (a)(4). Such
43 bond shall not be reduced or modified downward unless the magistrate

SB 186—Am. by HC 10
1 determines by a preponderance of the evidence at an evidentiary hearing
2 and makes a written finding on the record that the defendant is not a
3 public safety risk and not a flight risk. At such evidentiary hearing, there
4 shall be a presumption that the defendant is both a public safety risk and a
5 flight risk.
6 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 22-2803 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
7 2803. A person who remains in custody after review of such person's
8 application pursuant to subsection (9) or (10) of K.S.A. 22-2802(i) or
9 (j), and amendments thereto, by a district magistrate judge may apply
10 to a district judge of the judicial district in which the charge is
11 pending to modify the order fixing conditions of release. Such motion
12 shall be determined promptly.
13 Sec. 2. 5. K.S.A. 21-6810, 22-2302 is, 22-2802 and 22-2803 are
14 hereby repealed.
15 Sec. 3. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
16 publication in the statute book.
