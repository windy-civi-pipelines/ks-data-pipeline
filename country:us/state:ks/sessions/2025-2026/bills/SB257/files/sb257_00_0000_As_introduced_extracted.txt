17 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of privilege
18 fees actually owed shall be reconciled when the commissioner assesses

12 the commissioner shall determine at any time that the application of the
13 privilege fee, or a change in the rate of the privilege fee, would cause a
14 denial of, reduction in or elimination of federal financial assistance to the
15 state or to any health maintenance organization subject to this act, the
16 commissioner is hereby authorized to terminate the operation of such
17 privilege fee or the change in such privilege fee.
18 (c) For the purpose of insuring the collection of the privilege fee
19 provided for by subsection (b), every health maintenance organization
20 subject to this act and required by subsection (b) to pay such privilege fee
21 shall at the time it files its annual report, as required by K.S.A. 40-3220,
22 and amendments thereto, make a return, generated by or at the direction of
23 its chief officer or principal managing director, under penalty of K.S.A.
24 21-5824, and amendments thereto, to the commissioner, stating the amount
25 of all premiums, assessments and charges received by the health
26 maintenance organization, whether in cash or notes, during the year ending
27 on the last day of the preceding calendar year. Upon the receipt of such
28 returns the commissioner of insurance shall verify such returns and
29 reconcile the fees pursuant to subsection (f) upon such organization on the
30 basis and at the rate provided in this section.
31 (d) Premiums or other charges received by an insurance company
32 from the operation of a health maintenance organization subject to this act
33 shall not be subject to any fee or tax imposed under the provisions of
34 K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto.
35 (e) Fees charged under this section shall be remitted to the state
36 treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and
37 amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state
38 treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit
39 of the medical assistance fee fund created by K.S.A. 40-3236, and
40 amendments thereto.
41 (f) (1) On and after January 1, 2018, In addition to any other filing or
42 return required by this section, each health maintenance organization shall
43 submit a report to the commissioner on or before March 31 and September

SB 257 11
1 30 of each year containing an estimate of the total amount of all premiums,
2 subscription charges or any other term that may be used to describe the
3 charges made by such organization to enrollees that the organization
4 expects to collect during the current calendar year. Upon filing each March
5 31 report, the organization shall submit payment equal to ½ of the
6 privilege fee that would be assessed by the commissioner for the current
7 calendar year based upon the organization's reported estimate. Upon filing
8 each September 30 report, the organization shall submit payment equal to
9 the balance of the privilege fee that would be assessed by the
10 commissioner for the current calendar year based upon the organization's
11 reported estimates.
12 (2) Any amount of privilege fees actually owed by a health
13 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of estimated
14 privilege fees paid shall be assessed by the commissioner and shall be due
15 and payable upon issuance of such assessment.
16 (3) Any amount of estimated privilege fees paid by a health
17 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of privilege
18 fees actually owed shall be reconciled when the commissioner assesses
19 privilege fees in the ensuing calendar year. The commissioner shall credit
20 such excess amount against future privilege fee assessments. Any such
21 excess amount paid by a health maintenance organization that is no longer
22 doing business in Kansas and that no longer has a duty to pay the privilege
23 fee shall be refunded by the commissioner from funds appropriated by the
24 legislature for such purpose.
25 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 39-7,160 and 40-3213 are hereby repealed.
26 Sec. 15. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
27 publication in the Kansas register.
