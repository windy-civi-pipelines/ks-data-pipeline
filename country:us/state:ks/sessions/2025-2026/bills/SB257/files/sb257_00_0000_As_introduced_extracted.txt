12 the commissioner shall determine at any time that the application of the
13 privilege fee, or a change in the rate of the privilege fee, would cause a
14 denial of, reduction in or elimination of federal financial assistance to the
15 state or to any health maintenance organization subject to this act, the
16 commissioner is hereby authorized to terminate the operation of such
17 privilege fee or the change in such privilege fee.
18 (c) For the purpose of insuring the collection of the privilege fee
19 provided for by subsection (b), every health maintenance organization

25 of all premiums, assessments and charges received by the health
26 maintenance organization, whether in cash or notes, during the year ending
27 on the last day of the preceding calendar year. Upon the receipt of such
28 returns the commissioner of insurance shall verify such returns and
29 reconcile the fees pursuant to subsection (f) upon such organization on the
30 basis and at the rate provided in this section.
31 (d) Premiums or other charges received by an insurance company

36 treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and

2 subscription charges or any other term that may be used to describe the
3 charges made by such organization to enrollees that the organization
4 expects to collect during the current calendar year. Upon filing each March
5 31 report, the organization shall submit payment equal to ยฝ of the
6 privilege fee that would be assessed by the commissioner for the current
7 calendar year based upon the organization's reported estimate. Upon filing
8 each September 30 report, the organization shall submit payment equal to
9 the balance of the privilege fee that would be assessed by the
10 commissioner for the current calendar year based upon the organization's
11 reported estimates.
12 (2) Any amount of privilege fees actually owed by a health
13 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of estimated
14 privilege fees paid shall be assessed by the commissioner and shall be due
15 and payable upon issuance of such assessment.
16 (3) Any amount of estimated privilege fees paid by a health
17 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of privilege
18 fees actually owed shall be reconciled when the commissioner assesses
19 privilege fees in the ensuing calendar year. The commissioner shall credit
20 such excess amount against future privilege fee assessments. Any such
21 excess amount paid by a health maintenance organization that is no longer
22 doing business in Kansas and that no longer has a duty to pay the privilege
23 fee shall be refunded by the commissioner from funds appropriated by the
24 legislature for such purpose.
25 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 39-7,160 and 40-3213 are hereby repealed.
26 Sec. 15. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
27 publication in the Kansas register.
