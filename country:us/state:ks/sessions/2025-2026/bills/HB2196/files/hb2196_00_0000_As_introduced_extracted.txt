25 the building is conspicuously posted in accordance with K.S.A. 75-7c10,
26 and amendments thereto.
27 (d) (1) It shall not be a violation of the personal and family protection

30 enter through a restricted access entrance into such building, or public area
31 thereof, that provides adequate security measures at all public access
32 entrances and the building, or public area thereof, is conspicuously posted
33 in accordance with K.S.A. 75-7c10, and amendments thereto.
34 (2) Any person, who is not an employee of the state or a municipality

6 secure area of a building located on such premises, except those areas of
