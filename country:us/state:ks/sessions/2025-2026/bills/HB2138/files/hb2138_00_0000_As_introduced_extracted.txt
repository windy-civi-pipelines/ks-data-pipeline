32 shall receive payment from the school district capital outlay state aid fund
33 in an amount determined by the state board of education as provided in
34 this section.
35 (c) The state board shall:
36 (1) Determine the amount of the assessed valuation per student of
37 each school district in the state for the preceding school year and round
38 such amount to the nearest $1,000. The rounded amount is the assessed
39 valuation per student of a school district for the purposes of this
40 subsection;
41 (2) determine the median assessed valuation per student of all school
42 districts;
43 (3) prepare a schedule of dollar amounts using the amount of the
HB 2138 12
1 median assessed valuation per student of all school districts as the point of
2 beginning. The schedule of dollar amounts shall range upward in equal
3 $1,000 intervals from the point of beginning to and including an amount
4 that is equal to the amount of the assessed valuation per student of the
5 school district with the highest assessed valuation per student of all school
6 districts and shall range downward in equal $1,000 intervals from the point
7 of beginning to and including an amount that is equal to the amount of the
8 assessed valuation per student of the school district with the lowest
9 assessed valuation per student of all school districts;
10 (4) determine a state aid percentage factor for each school district by
11 assigning a state aid computation percentage to the amount of the median
12 assessed valuation per student shown on the schedule, decreasing the state
13 aid computation percentage assigned to the amount of the median assessed
14 valuation per student by one percentage point for each $1,000 interval
15 above the amount of the median assessed valuation per student, and
16 increasing the state aid computation percentage assigned to the amount of
17 the median assessed valuation per student by one percentage point for each
18 $1,000 interval below the amount of the median assessed valuation per
19 student. The state aid percentage factor of a school district is the
20 percentage assigned to the schedule amount that is equal to the amount of
21 the assessed valuation per student of the school district, except that the
22 state aid percentage factor of a school district shall not exceed 100%. The
23 state aid computation percentage is 25%;
24 (5) determine the aggregate amount levied by each school district
25 pursuant to K.S.A. 72-53,113 et seq., and amendments thereto, and section
26 1, and amendments thereto; and
27 (6) multiply the amount computed under subsection (c)(5), but not to
28 exceed eight 10 mills, by the applicable state aid percentage factor. The
29 resulting product is the amount of payment the school district is to receive
30 from the school district capital outlay state aid fund in the school year.
31 (d) The state board shall certify to the director of accounts and reports
32 the amount of school district capital outlay state aid determined under the
33 provisions of subsection (c), and an amount equal thereto shall be
34 transferred by the director from the state general fund to the school district
35 capital outlay state aid fund for distribution to school districts. All transfers
36 made in accordance with the provisions of this subsection shall be
37 considered to be demand transfers from the state general fund.
38 (e) Payments from the school district capital outlay state aid fund
39 shall be distributed to school districts at times determined by the state
40 board of education. The state board of education shall certify to the
41 director of accounts and reports the amount due each school district, and
42 the director of accounts and reports shall draw a warrant on the state
43 treasury payable to the treasurer of the school district. Upon receipt of the
HB 2138 13
1 warrant, the treasurer of the school district shall credit the amount thereof
2 to the capital outlay fund of the school district to be used for the purposes
3 of such fund.
4 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 12-1770a and 72-53,126 are hereby repealed.
5 Sec. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
6 publication in the statute book.

15 so adopted and the tax levy therein specified is approved under, the
16 amount of bonds that may be issued under K.S.A. 72-53,117, and
17 amendments thereto, may be increased accordingly.
18 (e) The board of education of any school district that has made a tax
19 levy under this section may at any time initiate procedures to renew its
