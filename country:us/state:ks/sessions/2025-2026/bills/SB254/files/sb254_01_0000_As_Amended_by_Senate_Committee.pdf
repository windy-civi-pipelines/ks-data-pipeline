29 (2) Such affirmative proof shall include documentary evidence
30 recognized by the division of motor vehicles when processing an
31 application for a driver's license, as established in K.S.A. 8-240, and
32 amendments thereto, as well as any document issued by the federal
33 government that confirms an alien's lawful presence in the United States.
34 (c) (1) No state, county or local agency shall provide any public
35 benefit to any alien without first verifying that the alien is lawfully present
36 in the United States and a qualified alien.

SB 254—Am. by SC 2
1 (2) Such verification shall occur through the systematic alien
2 verification for entitlements program, operated by the United States
3 department of homeland security.
4 (d) State and local agencies administering public benefits in this state
5 shall cooperate with the United States department of homeland security in
6 achieving verification of aliens' lawful presence in the United States in
7 furtherance of this section.
8 (e) As used in this section:
9 (1) "Lawfully present in the United States" means the same as
10 defined in 8 C.F.R. § 1.3.
11 (2) "Postsecondary educational institution" means the same as
12 defined in K.S.A. 74-3201b, and amendments thereto.

21 reduced tuition or fee amounts under any circumstances. Any provision of
22 K.S.A. 76-731a, and amendments thereto, that is contrary to the
23 prohibitions of this section shall be void.
24 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-2802 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
25 2802. (1) Any person charged with a crime shall, at the person's first
26 appearance before a magistrate, be ordered released pending preliminary
27 examination or trial upon the execution of an appearance bond in an
28 amount specified by the magistrate and sufficient to assure the appearance
29 of such person before the magistrate when ordered and to assure the public
30 safety. If the person charged with a crime is not a citizen or national of the
31 United States, such person's immigration status shall be verified with the
32 federal government pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c). For the purposes of
33 determining the grant of or issuance of an appearance bond, it shall be a
34 rebuttable presumption that a person who has been determined to be an
35 alien unlawfully present in the United States is at risk of flight. If the
36 person is being bound over for a felony, the bond shall also be conditioned
37 on the person's appearance in the district court or by way of a two-way
38 electronic audio-video communication as provided in subsection (14) at
39 the time required by the court to answer the charge against such person
40 and at any time thereafter that the court requires. Unless the magistrate
41 makes a specific finding otherwise, if the person is being bonded out for a
42 person felony or a person misdemeanor, the bond shall be conditioned on
43 the person being prohibited from having any contact with the alleged

SB 254—Am. by SC 3
1 victim of such offense for a period of at least 72 hours. The magistrate
2 may impose such of the following additional conditions of release as will
3 reasonably assure the appearance of the person for preliminary
4 examination or trial:
5 (a) Place the person in the custody of a designated person or
6 organization agreeing to supervise such person;
7 (b) place restrictions on the travel, association or place of abode of
8 the person during the period of release;
9 (c) impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary to
10 assure appearance as required, including a condition requiring that the
11 person return to custody during specified hours;
12 (d) place the person under a house arrest program pursuant to K.S.A.
13 21-6609, and amendments thereto; or
14 (e) place the person under the supervision of a court services officer
15 responsible for monitoring the person's compliance with any conditions of
16 release ordered by the magistrate. The magistrate may order the person to
17 pay for any costs associated with the supervision provided by the court
18 services department in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of such
19 supervision. The magistrate may also order the person to pay for all other
20 costs associated with the supervision and conditions for compliance in
21 addition to the $15 per week.
22 (2) In addition to any conditions of release provided in subsection (1),
23 for any person charged with a felony, the magistrate may order such
24 person to submit to a drug and alcohol abuse examination and evaluation
25 in a public or private treatment facility or state institution and, if
26 determined by the head of such facility or institution that such person is a
27 drug or alcohol abuser or is incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, to submit to
28 treatment for such drug or alcohol abuse, as a condition of release.
29 (3) The appearance bond shall be executed with sufficient solvent
30 sureties who are residents of the state of Kansas, unless the magistrate
31 determines, in the exercise of such magistrate's discretion and after a
32 hearing at which the person charged is present, that requiring sureties is
33 not necessary to assure the appearance of the person at the time ordered.
34 (4) A deposit of cash in the amount of the bond may be made in lieu
35 of the execution of the bond pursuant to subsection (3). Except as provided
36 in subsection (5), such deposit shall be in the full amount of the bond and
37 in no event shall a deposit of cash in less than the full amount of bond be
38 permitted. Any person charged with a crime who is released on a cash
39 bond shall be entitled to a refund of all moneys paid for the cash bond,
40 after deduction of any outstanding restitution, costs, fines and fees, after
41 the final disposition of the criminal case if the person complies with all
42 requirements to appear in court. The court may not exclude the option of
43 posting bond pursuant to subsection (3).

SB 254—Am. by SC 4
1 (5) Except as provided further, the amount of the appearance bond
2 shall be the same whether executed as described in subsection (3) or
3 posted with a deposit of cash as described in subsection (4). When the
4 appearance bond has been set at $2,500 or less and the most serious charge
5 against the person is a misdemeanor, a severity level 8, 9 or 10 nonperson
6 felony, a drug severity level 4 felony committed prior to July 1, 2012, a
7 drug severity level 5 felony committed on or after July 1, 2012, or a
8 violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and amendments thereto, the magistrate may
9 allow the person to deposit cash with the clerk in the amount of 10% of the
10 bond, provided the person meets at least the following qualifications:
11 (A) Is a resident of the state of Kansas;
12 (B) has a criminal history score category of G, H or I;
13 (C) has no prior history of failure to appear for any court
14 appearances;
15 (D) has no detainer or hold from any other jurisdiction;
16 (E) has not been extradited from, and is not awaiting extradition to,
17 another state; and
18 (F) has not been detained for an alleged violation of probation.
19 (6) In the discretion of the court, a person charged with a crime who
20 is not a flight risk or a risk to public safety may be released upon the
21 person's own recognizance by guaranteeing payment of the amount of the
22 bond for the person's failure to comply with all requirements to appear in
23 court. The release of a person charged with a crime upon the person's own
24 recognizance shall not require the deposit of any cash by the person.
25 (7) The court shall not impose any administrative fee.
26 (8) (A) In determining which conditions of release will reasonably
27 assure appearance and the public safety, the magistrate shall, on the basis
28 of available information, take into account the nature and circumstances of
29 the crime charged; the weight of the evidence against the defendant;
30 whether the defendant is lawfully present in the United States; the
31 defendant's family ties, employment, financial resources, character, mental
32 condition, length of residence in the community, record of convictions,
33 record of appearance or failure to appear at court proceedings or of flight
34 to avoid prosecution; the likelihood or propensity of the defendant to
35 commit crimes while on release, including whether the defendant will be
36 likely to threaten, harass or cause injury to the victim of the crime or any
37 witnesses thereto; and whether the defendant is on probation or parole
38 from a previous offense at the time of the alleged commission of the
39 subsequent offense.
40 (B) If the person charged with a crime is not a citizen or national of
41 the United States, such person's immigration status shall be verified with
42 the federal government pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c). For the purposes
43 of determining the grant of or issuance of an appearance bond, it shall

SB 254—Am. by SC 5
1 be a rebuttable presumption that a person who has been determined to
2 be an alien unlawfully present in the United States is at risk of flight.
3 (9) The appearance bond shall set forth all of the conditions of
4 release.
5 (10) A person for whom conditions of release are imposed and who
6 continues to be detained as a result of the person's inability to meet the
7 conditions of release shall be entitled, upon application, to have the
8 conditions reviewed without unnecessary delay by the magistrate who
9 imposed them. If the magistrate who imposed conditions of release is not
10 available, any other magistrate in the county may review such conditions.
11 (11) A magistrate ordering the release of a person on any conditions
12 specified in this section may at any time amend the order to impose
13 additional or different conditions of release. If the imposition of additional
14 or different conditions results in the detention of the person, the provisions
15 of subsection (10) shall apply.
16 (12) Statements or information offered in determining the conditions
17 of release need not conform to the rules of evidence. No statement or
18 admission of the defendant made at such a proceeding shall be received as
19 evidence in any subsequent proceeding against the defendant.
20 (13) The appearance bond and any security required as a condition of
21 the defendant's release shall be deposited in the office of the magistrate or
22 the clerk of the court where the release is ordered. If the defendant is
23 bound to appear before a magistrate or court other than the one ordering
24 the release, the order of release, together with the bond and security shall
25 be transmitted to the magistrate or clerk of the court before whom the
26 defendant is bound to appear.
27 (14) Proceedings before a magistrate as provided in this section to
28 determine the release conditions of a person charged with a crime
29 including release upon execution of an appearance bond may be conducted
30 by two-way electronic audio-video communication between the defendant
31 and the judge in lieu of personal presence of the defendant or defendant's
32 counsel in the courtroom in the discretion of the court. The defendant may
33 be accompanied by the defendant's counsel. The defendant shall be
34 informed of the defendant's right to be personally present in the courtroom
35 during such proceeding if the defendant so requests. Exercising the right to
36 be present shall in no way prejudice the defendant.
37 (15) The magistrate may order the person to pay for any costs
38 associated with the supervision of the conditions of release of the
39 appearance bond in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of such
40 supervision. As a condition of sentencing under K.S.A. 21-6604, and
41 amendments thereto, the court may impose the full amount of any such
42 costs in addition to the $15 per week, including, but not limited to, costs
43 for treatment and evaluation under subsection (2).

SB 254—Am. by SC 6
1 New Sec. 3. If any provision of this act is held to be unconstitutional
2 under the constitution of the United States or the constitution of the state

5 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 22-2802 is hereby repealed.
6 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
7 publication in the statute book.
