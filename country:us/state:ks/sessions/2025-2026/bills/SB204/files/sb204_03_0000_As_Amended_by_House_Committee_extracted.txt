12 paragraph shall prohibit disclosure of case or warrant information to law
13 enforcement for the purposes of executing such warrant.
14 (2) All subpoenas issued in a criminal case or a case pursuant to the
15 revised Kansas juvenile justice code shall be sealed by the court and a
16 subpoena shall only be unsealed if the court makes a finding that
17 unsealing such subpoena is in the interest of justice.
18 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall apply retroactively to any
19 case or warrant information or subpoenas that are currently pending.
20 (4) Nothing in this subsection shall{:
21 (A) }Prohibit disclosure of warrant information, subpoenas, returns
22 of service or other case information to law enforcement for the purposes
23 of executing a warrant or serving a subpoena{; or
24 (B) apply to a warrant issued pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2807, and
25 amendments thereto}.
26 (5) As used in this subsection, "seal" means that no information
27 related to a case, or warrant or subpoena, including the existence of such
28 case, or warrant or subpoena, shall be made available to the public.
29 Subpoenas and returns of service for subpoenas shall not be made
30 available to the public.
31 (b) In a civil or criminal case, the court, upon the court's own motion,
32 may hold a hearing or any party may request a hearing to seal or redact the
SB 204—Am. by HC 2
1 court records or to close a court proceeding. Reasonable notice of a
2 hearing to seal or redact court records or to close a court proceeding shall
3 be given to all parties in the case. In a criminal case, reasonable notice of a
4 hearing to seal or redact court records or to close a court proceeding shall
5 also be given to the victim, if ascertainable.
6 (b)(c) After the hearing, the court may order the court files and
7 records in the proceeding, or any part thereof, to be sealed or redacted or

10 make and enter a written finding of good cause.
11 (c)(d) In granting the order, the court shall recognize that the public

14 public forum for resolution.
15 (d)(e) Good cause to close a proceeding or seal or redact records,
16 whether upon the motion of a party, or on the court's own motion, does not
17 exist unless the court makes a finding on the record that there exists an
18 identified safety, property or privacy interest of a litigant or a public or
19 private harm that predominates the case and such interest or harm
20 outweighs the strong public interest in access to the court record and
21 proceedings.
22 (e)(f) Agreement of the parties shall be considered by the court but
23 shall not constitute the sole basis for the sealing or redaction of court
24 records or for closing the court proceeding.

28 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto, the Kansas adoption and
29 relinquishment act, K.S.A. 59-2111 et seq., and amendments thereto, to
30 supreme court rules which allow motions, briefs, opinions and orders of
31 the court to identify parties by initials or by familial relationship or to
32 supreme court rules which require appellate court deliberations to be kept
33 in strict confidence. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
34 the issuance of a protective order pursuant to subsection (c) of K.S.A. 60-
35 226(c), and amendments thereto.
