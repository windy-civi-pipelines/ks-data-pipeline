HB 2108 5
1 to exceed $10,000 upon finding that a large energy facility owner has
2 violated the provisions of this act, the provisions of a code of conduct
3 permit or any rule and regulation or order of the commission. Such penalty
4 shall constitute an actual and substantial economic deterrent to the
5 violation for which the penalty is assessed. In the case of a continuing
6 violation, the commission may deem every day such violation continues as
7 a separate violation.
8 (2) No penalty shall be imposed pursuant to this subsection except
9 upon the written order of the commission to the large energy facility owner
10 who committed the violation. The order shall state the violation, the
11 penalty imposed and the right to appeal such order to the commission. Any
12 such facility owner, within 30 days after service of such order, may make
13 written request to the commission for a hearing. The commission shall
14 conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas
15 administrative procedure act within 30 days after receipt of such request.
16 (3) Any large energy facility owner aggrieved by any order issued
17 pursuant to this subsection may appeal such order in accordance with the
18 provisions of the Kansas judicial review act.
19 (4) The commission may order a large energy facility owner to pay
20 any costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the commission in
21 imposing and collecting any penalty pursuant to this subsection and may
22 collect interest on any portion of such penalty, costs and attorney fees that
23 remains unpaid more than 30 days after imposition, at the rate provided by
24 K.S.A. 16-204, and amendments thereto, for interest on judgments.
25 (5) All moneys received from penalties imposed and costs and
26 attorney fees assessed pursuant to this section shall be remitted to the state
27 treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and

29 treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit
30 of the state general fund.
31 Sec. 4. The commission may adopt rules and regulations to
32 administer sections 1 through 3, and amendments thereto.
33 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
34 publication in the statute book.
