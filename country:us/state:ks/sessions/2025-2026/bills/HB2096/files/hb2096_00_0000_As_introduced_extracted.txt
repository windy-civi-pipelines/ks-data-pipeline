25 and issue such amount of tax credits in the immediately succeeding tax
26 year in addition to the statutory amount that may be issued under this

40 (d) Any qualified investor who receives a tax credit pursuant to this
41 section shall be deemed to acquire an interest in the nature of a
42 transferable credit limited to the amount of the credit issued to the
43 qualified investor by the director. All or a portion of such credit may be
HB 2096 3
1 transferred by the qualified investor or any subsequent transferee to one or
2 more persons, whether or not such transferee is then a qualified investor,
3 and be claimed by the transferee as a credit against the transferee's Kansas
4 tax liability in the same manner as the transferor beginning in the year the
5 credit is transferred provided in subsection (a) beginning in the year the
6 cash investment was originally made by the qualified investor. The credit
7 may be carried forward as permitted by subsection (a). There shall be no

12 such transferee succeeds to all remaining rights and restrictions of the
13 transferor with respect to the credit being transferred on the date of such
14 transfer. Documentation of any credit acquired by transfer shall be
15 provided by the taxpayer claiming such credit in the manner required by
16 the secretary of revenue. The qualified investor or subsequent transferee

27 tax paid under K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto.
28 (g) The provisions of subsection (d), as amended by this act, shall
29 apply retroactively to any credits issued for tax year 2022 and all tax
30 years thereafter.
