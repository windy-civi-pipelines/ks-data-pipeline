37 action where the underlying rental agreement is governed by K.S.A. 58-
38 2540 et seq., and amendments thereto, within the two-year period

7 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 60-2617 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 60-2617. (a) In a civil or criminal case, the court, upon the court's
9 own motion, may hold a hearing or any party may request a hearing to seal
10 or redact the court records or to close a court proceeding. Reasonable
11 notice of a hearing to seal or redact court records or to close a court
12 proceeding shall be given to all parties in the case. In a criminal case,
13 reasonable notice of a hearing to seal or redact court records or to close a
14 court proceeding shall also be given to the victim, if ascertainable.
15 (b) After the hearing, the court may order the court files and records
16 in the proceeding, or any part thereof, to be sealed or redacted or the court
17 proceeding closed. If the court grants such an order, before closing
18 proceedings or granting leave to file under seal, the court shall make and
19 enter a written finding of good cause.
20 (c) In granting the order, the court shall recognize that the public has
21 a paramount interest in all that occurs in a case, whether at trial or during
22 discovery and in understanding disputes that are presented to a public
23 forum for resolution.
24 (d) Good cause to close a proceeding or seal or redact records,
25 whether upon the motion of a party, or on the court's own motion, does not
26 exist unless the court makes a finding on the record that there exists an
27 identified safety, property or privacy interest of a litigant or a public or
28 private harm that predominates the case and such interest or harm
29 outweighs the strong public interest in access to the court record and
30 proceedings.
31 (e) Agreement of the parties shall be considered by the court but shall
32 not constitute the sole basis for the sealing or redaction of court records or
33 for closing the court proceeding.
34 (f) The provisions of this section shall not apply to proceedings under
35 the revised Kansas code for care of children, K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq., and

37 2301 et seq., and amendments thereto, the Kansas adoption and
38 relinquishment act, K.S.A. 59-2111 et seq., and amendments thereto,

40 rental agreement is governed by K.S.A. 58-2540 et seq., and amendments
41 thereto, and section 1, and amendments thereto, to supreme court rules
42 which allow motions, briefs, opinions and orders of the court to identify
43 parties by initials or by familial relationship or to supreme court rules

HB 2357 4
1 which require appellate court deliberations to be kept in strict confidence.
2 Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the issuance of a
3 protective order pursuant to subsection (c) of K.S.A. 60-226(c), and
4 amendments thereto.
5 (g) The provisions of this section shall not preclude a court from
6 allowing a settlement which includes a confidentiality clause to be filed

8 settlement being filed under seal.

10 3804. (a) The petition shall describe the premises for which possession is
11 sought and why the plaintiff is seeking possession. If there is rent due for
12 possession of the premises, the petition may include a request for
13 judgment for that amount or the plaintiff may bring a subsequent lawsuit
14 for that amount.
15 (b) In an action where the underlying rental agreement is governed
16 by K.S.A. 58-2540 et seq., and amendments thereto, the petition, court
17 records and file shall be sealed as provided by section 1, and amendments
18 thereto.
19 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 61-3806 is hereby amended to read as follows: 61-

21 appear in person or by counsel at the time and date set forth in the
22 summons or file on or before such date a written answer.

27 (1) Allow the defendant to appear by two-way electronic audio-video
28 communication between the defendant and the judge in lieu of personal
29 presence of the defendant; and
