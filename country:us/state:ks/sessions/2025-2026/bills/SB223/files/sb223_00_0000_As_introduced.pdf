23 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
24 (c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
25 subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total tangible
26 property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax revenue
27 derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible property
28 located within each such city or county. The ad valorem property tax levy
29 of any county or city district entity or subdivision shall be included within
30 this term if the levy of any such district entity or subdivision is applicable
31 to all tangible property located within each such city or county.
32 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
33 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for the
34 purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be included
35 within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such city regardless
36 of its applicability to all tangible property located within each such city. If
37 the tax is levied by a district which extends across city boundaries, for
38 purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy shall be apportioned
39 among each city in which such district extends in the proportion that such
40 tax levied within each city bears to the total tax levied by the district.
41 (d) (1) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
42 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I), (6),
43 (7), (8), (9), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (23), (25),

1 (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and, (38) and
2 (39), and amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by
3 the county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue
4 received from the tax was pledged.
5 (2) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and
6 amendments thereto, all revenues received from a countywide retailers'
7 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
8 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
9 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax
10 was pledged.
11 (3) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
12 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, shall
13 be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended only for
14 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged
15 unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax authorized
16 by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes the
17 apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
18 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall be
19 paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general fund
20 of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or more
21 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
22 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
23 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
24 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
25 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
26 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
27 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
28 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
29 each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county from the
30 state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.
31 (g) Prior to December 31 of each year, the clerk of every county
32 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such information
33 deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion and remit
34 revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
35 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment of
36 countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues received
37 pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or collected
38 under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such revenue
39 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall be
40 deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
41 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.
42 74-8927, and amendments thereto.
43 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-187, 12-189 and 12-192 are hereby

SB 223 22
1 repealed.
2 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
3 publication in the statute book.
