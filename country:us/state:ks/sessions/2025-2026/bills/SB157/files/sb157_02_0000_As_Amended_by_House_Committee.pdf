22 searched and things to be seized. Any statement which that is made
23 orally shall be either taken down by a certified shorthand reporter,
24 sworn to under oath and made part of the application for a search
25 warrant, or recorded before the magistrate from whom the search
26 warrant is requested and sworn to under oath. Any statement orally
27 made shall be reduced to writing as soon thereafter as possible. If the
28 magistrate is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that
29 there is probable cause to believe that they exist, the magistrate may
30 issue a search warrant for:
31 (1) The search or seizure of the following:
32 (A) Anything that can be seized under the fourth amendment of
33 the United States constitution;
34 (B) anything which that has been used in the commission of a

SB 157—Am. by HC 2
1 crime, or any contraband or any property which that constitutes or
2 may be considered a part of the evidence, fruits or instrumentalities of
3 a crime under the laws of this state, any other state or of the United
4 States. The term "fruits" as used in this act shall be interpreted to
5 include any property into which the thing or things unlawfully taken
6 or possessed may have been converted;
7 (C) any person who has been kidnapped in violation of the laws
8 of this state or who has been kidnapped in another jurisdiction and is
9 now concealed within this state;

17 electronic communications systems, including, but not limited to,
18 towers transmitting cellular signals involved in any wire
19 communication;, and any other information made through an
20 electronic communications system; or
21 (ii) the jurisdiction granted in this paragraph shall extend to
22 information held by entities registered to do business in the state of
23 Kansas, submitting to the jurisdiction thereof, and entities primarily
24 located outside the state of Kansas if the jurisdiction in which the
25 entity is primarily located recognizes the authority of the magistrate to
26 issue the search warrant; or
27 (2) the installation, maintenance and use of a tracking device.
28 (b) (1) The search warrant under subsection (a)(2) shall authorize
29 the installation and use of the tracking device to track and collect
30 tracking data relating to a person or property for a specified period of
31 time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the installation of the
32 device.
33 (2) The search warrant under subsection (a)(2) may authorize the
34 retrieval of the tracking data recorded by the tracking device during
35 the specified period of time for authorized use of such tracking device
36 within a reasonable time after the expiration of such warrant, for good
37 cause shown.
38 (3) The magistrate may, for good cause shown, grant one or more
39 extensions of a search warrant under subsection (a)(2) for the use of a
40 tracking device, not to exceed 30 days each.
41 (c) Before ruling on a request for a search warrant, the
42 magistrate may require the affiant to appear personally and may
43 examine under oath the affiant and any witnesses that the affiant may

SB 157—Am. by HC 3
1 produce. Such proceeding shall be taken down by a certified
2 shorthand reporter or recording equipment and made part of the
3 application for a search warrant.
4 (d) For a warrant executed prior to July 1, 2014, affidavits or
5 sworn testimony in support of the probable cause requirement of this
6 section or search warrants for tracking devices shall not be made
7 available for examination without a written order of the court, except
8 that such affidavits or testimony when requested shall be made
9 available to the defendant or the defendant's counsel for such
10 disposition as either may desire.
11 (e) (1) For a warrant executed on or after July 1, 2014, affidavits
12 or sworn testimony in support of the probable cause requirement of
13 this section or search warrants for tracking devices shall not be open
14 to the public until the warrant has been executed. After the warrant
15 has been executed, such affidavits or sworn testimony shall be made
16 available to:
17 (A) The defendant or the defendant's counsel, when requested,
18 for such disposition as either may desire; and
19 (B) any person, when requested, in accordance with the
20 requirements of this subsection.
21 (2) Any person may request that affidavits or sworn testimony be
22 disclosed by filing such request with the clerk of the court. The clerk
23 of the court shall promptly notify the defendant or the defendant's
24 counsel, the prosecutor and the magistrate that such request was filed.
25 The prosecutor shall promptly notify any victim.
26 (3) Within five business days after receiving notice of a request
27 for disclosure from the clerk of the court, the defendant or the
28 defendant's counsel and the prosecutor may submit to the magistrate,
29 under seal, either:
30 (A) Proposed redactions, if any, to the affidavits or sworn
31 testimony and the reasons supporting such proposed redactions; or
32 (B) a motion to seal the affidavits or sworn testimony and the
33 reasons supporting such proposed seal.
34 (4) The magistrate shall review the requested affidavits or sworn
35 testimony and any proposed redactions or motion to seal submitted by
36 the defendant, the defendant's counsel or the prosecutor. The
37 magistrate shall make appropriate redactions, or seal the affidavits or
38 sworn testimony, as necessary to prevent public disclosure of
39 information that would:
40 (A) Jeopardize the physical, mental or emotional safety or well-
41 being of a victim, witness, confidential source or undercover agent, or
42 cause the destruction of evidence;
43 (B) reveal information obtained from a court-ordered wiretap or

SB 157—Am. by HC 4
1 from a search warrant for a tracking device that has not expired;
2 (C) interfere with any prospective law enforcement action,
3 criminal investigation or prosecution;
4 (D) reveal the identity of any confidential source or undercover
5 agent;
6 (E) reveal confidential investigative techniques or procedures not
7 known to the general public;
8 (F) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;
9 (G) reveal the name, address, telephone number or any other
10 information which specifically and individually identifies the victim of
11 any sexual offense described in article 35 of chapter 21 of the Kansas
12 Statutes Annotated, prior to their repeal, or article 55 of chapter 21 of
13 the Kansas Statutes Annotated or K.S.A. 21-6419 through 21-6422,
14 and amendments thereto;
15 (H) reveal the name of any minor;
16 (I) reveal any date of birth, personal or business telephone
17 number, driver's license number, nondriver's identification number,
18 social security number, employee identification number, taxpayer
19 identification number, vehicle identification number or financial
20 account information; or
21 (J) constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
22 As used in this subparagraph, "clearly unwarranted invasion of
23 personal privacy" means revealing information that would be highly
24 offensive to a reasonable person and is totally unrelated to the alleged
25 crime that resulted in the issuance of the search warrant, including
26 information totally unrelated to the alleged crime that may pose a risk
27 to a person or property and is not of legitimate concern to the public.
28 The provisions of this subparagraph shall only be used to redact and
29 shall not be used to seal affidavits or sworn testimony.
30 (5) Within five business days after receiving proposed redactions
31 or a motion to seal from the defendant, the defendant's counsel or the
32 prosecutor, or within 10 business days after receiving notice of a
33 request for disclosure, whichever is earlier, the magistrate shall either:
34 (A) Order disclosure of the affidavits or sworn testimony with
35 appropriate redactions, if any; or
36 (B) order the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed and not subject
37 to public disclosure.
38 (6) (A) If the magistrate orders disclosure of the affidavits or
39 sworn testimony with appropriate redactions, if any, to any person in
40 accordance with the requirements of this subsection, then such
41 affidavits or sworn testimony shall become part of the court record
42 and shall be accessible to the public.
43 (B) If the magistrate orders the affidavits or sworn testimony

SB 157—Am. by HC 5
1 sealed and not subject to public disclosure in accordance with the
2 requirements of this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn
3 testimony shall become part of the court record that is not accessible
4 to the public.
5 (C) Any request for disclosure of affidavits or sworn testimony in
6 accordance with the requirements of this subsection shall become part
7 of the court record and shall be accessible to the public, regardless of
8 whether the magistrate orders disclosure with appropriate redactions,
9 if any, or sealing of the requested affidavit or sworn testimony.
10 (f) As used in this section:
11 (1) "Electronic communication" means the use of electronic
12 equipment to send or transfer a copy of an original document;
13 (2) "electronic communication service" and "electronic
14 communication system" have the meaning as defined in K.S.A. 22-
15 2514, and amendments thereto;
16 (3) "tracking data" means information gathered or recorded by a
17 tracking device;
18 (4) "tracking device" means an electronic or mechanical device
19 that permits a person to remotely determine or track the position or
20 movement of a person or object. "Tracking device" includes, but is

23 of movement; and
24 (5) "victim" shall include any victim of an alleged crime that
25 resulted in the issuance of the search warrant, or, if the victim is
26 deceased, the victim's family, as defined in K.S.A. 74-7335, and
27 amendments thereto.
28 (g) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
29 search warrant for cellular location information in an emergency
30 situation pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4615, and amendments thereto.
31 Section 1. Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-2807 is hereby amended to read as
32 follows: 22-2807. (a) If a defendant fails to appear as directed by the court
33 and guaranteed by an appearance bond, the court in which the bond is
34 deposited shall declare a forfeiture of the bail and issue a warrant for the
35 defendant's arrest. If the defendant is charged with a felony offense, the
36 sheriff shall enter such warrant into the national crime information center's
37 index within 14 days of issuance of the warrant and, upon request, the
38 court shall make a copy of the warrant available to a compensated surety
39 who deposited the bond on behalf of the defendant within 14 days of
40 issuance of the warrant. If such warrant is not entered into such index, the
41 sheriff shall notify the court thereof.
42 (b) An appearance bond may only be forfeited by the court upon a
43 failure to appear. If a defendant violates any other condition of bond, the

SB 157—Am. by HC 6
1 bond may be revoked and the defendant remanded to custody. An
2 appearance bond is revoked by the execution of a warrant for a defendant's
3 arrest for a violation of a bond condition. The magistrate shall promptly set
4 a new bond pursuant to requirements of K.S.A. 22-2802, and amendments
5 thereto.
6 (c) (1) The court may direct that a forfeiture be set aside, upon such
7 conditions as the court may impose, if it appears that justice does not
8 require the enforcement of the forfeiture.
9 (2) The court shall direct that a forfeiture be set aside, upon such
10 conditions as the court may impose, if:
11 (A) The surety can prove that the defendant has left the country been
12 deported from the United States or is incarcerated somewhere within the
13 United States prior to judgment of default by providing to the court a
14 written statement, signed by the surety under penalty of perjury, setting
15 forth details of the facts substantiating such incarceration claim
16 incarceration;
17 (B) the warrant required to be issued by subsection (a) was not issued
18 within 14 days of the forfeiture;
19 (C) a warrant that is required to be entered into the national crime
20 information center's index or provided to a compensated surety pursuant to
21 subsection (a) was not entered or provided within 14 days of issuance or
22 provided by the court to the surety upon request pursuant to
23 subsection (a), unless there is good cause shown for the failure to enter
24 such warrant into the index or provide such warrant to the compensated
25 surety; or
26 (D) the defendant has been arrested outside of this state and the
27 prosecuting attorney has declined to proceed with extradition; or
28 (E) the defendant was not held subject to an immigration
29 detainer when the bond was posted and the surety can prove that the
30 defendant has been deported from the United States prior to judgment
31 of default by providing to the court a written statement, signed by the
32 surety under penalty of perjury, setting forth the facts substantiating
33 the deportation.
34 (3) Upon the defendant's return, the surety may be ordered to pay the
35 costs of such return.
36 (d) When a forfeiture has not been set aside, the court shall on motion
37 enter a judgment of default and execution may issue thereon. If the
38 forfeiture has been decreed by a district magistrate judge and the amount
39 of the bond exceeds the limits of the civil jurisdiction prescribed by law
40 for a district magistrate judge, the judge shall notify the chief judge in
41 writing of the forfeiture and the matter shall be assigned to a district judge
42 who, on motion, shall enter a judgment of default. By entering into a bond
43 the obligors submit to the jurisdiction of any court having power to enter

SB 157—Am. by HC 7
1 judgment upon default and irrevocably appoint the clerk of that court as
2 their agent upon whom any papers affecting their liability may be served.
3 Their liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an
4 independent action. The motion and notice thereof may be served on the
5 clerk of the court, who shall forthwith promptly mail copies to the obligors
6 to their last known addresses. No judgment may be entered against the
7 obligor in an appearance bond until more than 60 days after notice is
8 served as provided herein in this section. No judgment may be entered
9 against the obligor in an appearance bond more than two years after a
10 defendant's failure to appear.
11 (e) After entry of judgment pursuant to subsection (d), the court:
12 (1) May remit such judgment in whole or in part under the conditions
13 applying to the setting aside of forfeiture in subsection (c); and
14 (2) shall remit 95% a portion of the amount of the appearance bond
15 to the obligor if the defendant is returned to custody within 180 the
16 following number of days after judgment is entered, as follows:
17 (A) 90% if the defendant is returned to custody within 90 days;
18 (B) 75% if the defendant is returned to custody within 91 to 180
19 days;
20 (C) 50% if the defendant is returned to custody within 181 to 270
21 days.

36 (3) "Property surety" means a compensated surety who secures

27 documentation from such bail agents demonstrating compliance with
28 subsection (b)(1); and

37 district, a compensated surety to submit to a state and national
38 criminal history record check. The fingerprints shall be used to

15 district pursuant to subsection (b) shall be allowed outstanding
16 appearance bonds in the state of Kansas not to exceed an aggregate
17 amount that is 15 times the valuation of the property described in
18 subsection (b)(3). Such property surety shall not write any single

5 information from any compensated surety and establish what
6 property is acceptable for bonding purposes under subsection (b)(3).
7 (2) A judicial district shall not require any compensated surety to
8 apply for authorization in such judicial district more than once per
9 year, but may require additional reporting from any compensated
10 surety in its discretion. If the judicial district does not require an

12 provide a certificate of continuing education compliance in accordance
13 with subsection (g) to the judicial district each year.
14 (3) A judicial district shall not decline authorization for a
15 compensated surety solely on the basis of type of compensated surety.
16 (f) (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the
17 chief judge of the judicial district, or the chief judge's designee, to
18 authorize any compensated surety to act as a surety in such judicial
19 district if the judge or designee finds, in such person's discretion, that
20 such authorization is not warranted.
21 (2) (A) If such authorization is granted, the chief judge of the
22 judicial district, or the chief judge's designee, may terminate or
23 suspend the authorization at any time. Reasons for terminating or

43 the principal when the principal is entitled to return of such security;

10 terminate the authorization of the compensated surety.
11 (C) If the authorization is suspended for 30 days or more, the
12 chief judge shall make a record describing the length of the suspension
13 and the underlying cause and provide such record to the surety. Such
14 surety, upon request, shall be entitled to a hearing within 30 days after
15 the suspension is ordered.

20 (3) If an authorized compensated surety does not comply with the
21 continuing education requirements in subsection (g), the chief judge of

24 such compensated surety does not comply with the continuing
25 education requirements in subsection (g) within 90 days, such
26 conditional authorization shall be terminated and such compensated
27 surety shall not act as a surety in such judicial district.
28 (g) (1) Every compensated surety shall obtain at least eight hours
29 of continuing education credits during each 12-month period.
30 (2) The Kansas bail agents association shall either provide or

35 the continuing education classes. A schedule of such classes shall be
36 publicly available. The association shall not charge more than $300
37 annually for the eight hours of continuing education classes, and the
38 cost of any class with less than eight hours of continuing education
39 may be prorated accordingly. Any fee charged for attending
40 continuing education classes shall not be increased or decreased based
41 upon a compensated surety's membership or lack of membership in
42 the association.
43 (3) Upon completion of at least eight hours of continuing

SB 157—Am. by HC 12
1 education credits during each 12-month period by a compensated
2 surety, the Kansas bail agents association shall issue a certificate of
3 continuing education compliance to such surety. The certificate shall
4 be prepared and delivered to the compensated surety within 30 days of
