3 other healthcare providers; amending K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 60-460 and
4 repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 60-460 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 60-460. Evidence of a statement which is made other than by a
9 witness while testifying at the hearing, offered to prove the truth of the
10 matter stated, is hearsay evidence and inadmissible except:
11 (a) Previous statements of persons present. A statement previously
12 made by a person who is present at the hearing and available for cross-
13 examination with respect to the statement and its subject matter, provided
14 the statement would be admissible if made by the declarant while
15 testifying as a witness.
16 (b) Affidavits. Affidavits, to the extent admissible by the statutes of
17 this state.
18 (c) Depositions and prior testimony. Subject to the same limitations
19 and objections as though the declarant were testifying in person: (1)
20 Testimony in the form of a deposition taken in compliance with the law of
21 this state for use as testimony in the trial of the action in which offered; or
22 (2) if the judge finds that the declarant is unavailable as a witness at the
23 hearing, testimony given as a witness in another action or in a preliminary
24 hearing or former trial in the same action, or in a deposition taken in
25 compliance with law for use as testimony in the trial of another action,
26 when: (A) The testimony is offered against a party who offered it in the
27 party's own behalf on the former occasion or against the successor in
28 interest of such party; or (B) the issue is such that the adverse party on the
29 former occasion had the right and opportunity for cross-examination with
30 an interest and motive similar to that which the adverse party has in the
31 action in which the testimony is offered, but the provisions of this
32 subsection shall not apply in criminal actions if it denies to the accused the
33 right to meet the witness face to face.
34 (d) Contemporaneous statements and statements admissible on
35 ground of necessity generally. A statement which the judge finds was
36 made: (1) While the declarant was perceiving the event or condition which

SB 127 2
1 the statement narrates, describes or explains; (2) while the declarant was
2 under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception; or (3)
3 if the declarant is unavailable as a witness, by the declarant at a time when
4 the matter had been recently perceived by the declarant and while the
5 declarant's recollection was clear and was made in good faith prior to the
6 commencement of the action and with no incentive to falsify or to distort.
7 (e) Dying declarations. A statement by a person unavailable as a
8 witness because of the person's death if the judge finds that it was made:
9 (1) Voluntarily and in good faith; and (2) while the declarant was
10 conscious of the declarant's impending death and believed that there was
11 no hope of recovery.
12 (f) Confessions. In a criminal proceeding as against the accused, a
13 previous statement by the accused relative to the offense charged, but only
14 if the judge finds that the accused: (1) When making the statement was
15 conscious and was capable of understanding what the accused said and
16 did; and (2) was not induced to make the statement: (A) Under compulsion
17 or by infliction or threats of infliction of suffering upon the accused or
18 another, or by prolonged interrogation under such circumstances as to
19 render the statement involuntary; or (B) by threats or promises concerning
20 action to be taken by a public official with reference to the crime, likely to
21 cause the accused to make such a statement falsely, and made by a person
22 whom the accused reasonably believed to have the power or authority to
23 execute the same.
24 (g) Admissions by parties. As against a party, a statement by the
25 person who is the party to the action in the person's individual or a
26 representative capacity and, if the latter, who was acting in such
27 representative capacity in making the statement.
28 (h) Authorized and adoptive admissions. As against a party, a
29 statement: (1) By a person authorized by the party to make a statement or
30 statements for the party concerning the subject of the statement; or (2) of
31 which the party with knowledge of the content thereof has, by words or
32 other conduct, manifested the party's adoption or belief in its truth.
33 (i) Vicarious admissions. As against a party, a statement which would
34 be admissible if made by the declarant at the hearing if: (1) The statement
35 concerned a matter within the scope of an agency or employment of the
36 declarant for the party and was made before the termination of such
37 relationship; (2) the party and the declarant were participating in a plan to
38 commit a crime or a civil wrong and the statement was relevant to the plan
39 or its subject matter and was made while the plan was in existence and
40 before its complete execution or other termination; or (3) one of the issues
41 between the party and the proponent of the evidence of the statement is a
42 legal liability of the declarant, and the statement tends to establish that
43 liability.

SB 127 3
1 (j) Declarations against interest. Subject to the limitations of the
2 exception in subsection (f), a statement which the judge finds was at the
3 time of the assertion so far contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or
4 proprietary interest or so far subjected the declarant to civil or criminal
5 liability or so far rendered invalid a claim by the declarant against another
6 or created such risk of making the declarant an object of hatred, ridicule or
7 social disapproval in the community that a reasonable person in the
8 declarant's position would not have made the statement unless the person
9 believed it to be true.
10 (k) Voter's statements. A statement by a voter concerning the voter's
11 qualifications to vote or the fact or content of the voter's vote.
12 (l) Statements of physical or mental condition of declarant. Unless
13 the judge finds it was made in bad faith, a statement of the declarant's: (1)
14 Then existing state of mind, emotion or physical sensation, including
15 statements of intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain and bodily
16 health, but not including memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or
17 believed, when such a mental or physical condition is in issue or is
18 relevant to prove or explain acts or conduct of the declarant; or (2)
19 previous symptoms, pain or physical sensation, made to a physician
20 healthcare provider as defined in K.S.A. 65-4915, and amendments
21 thereto, consulted for treatment or for diagnosis with a view to treatment,
22 and relevant to an issue of declarant's bodily condition.
23 (m) Business entries and the like. Writings offered as memoranda or
24 records of acts, conditions or events to prove the facts stated therein, if the
25 following conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or other
26 qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with K.S.A. 60-465(b)
27 (7) or (8), and amendments thereto: (1) They were made in the regular
28 course of a business at or about the time of the act, condition or event
29 recorded; and (2) the sources of information from which made and the
30 method and circumstances of their preparation were such as to indicate
31 their trustworthiness.
32 If the procedure specified by K.S.A. 60-245a(b), and amendments
33 thereto, for providing business records has been complied with and no
34 party has required the personal attendance of a custodian of the records or
35 the production of the original records, the affidavit or declaration of the
36 custodian shall be prima facie evidence that the records satisfy the
37 requirements of this subsection.
38 (n) Absence of entry in business records. Evidence of the absence of a
39 memorandum or record from the memoranda or records of a business of an
40 asserted act, event or condition, to prove the nonoccurrence of the act or
