4 38-2347 and repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 38-2347 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
8 2347. (a) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, at any time after
9 commencement of proceedings under this code against a juvenile and prior
10 to the beginning of an evidentiary hearing at which the court may enter a
11 sentence as provided in K.S.A. 38-2356, and amendments thereto, the
12 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee may
13 file a motion requesting that the court authorize prosecution of the juvenile
14 as an adult under the applicable criminal statute. The juvenile shall be
15 presumed to be a juvenile, and the presumption must be rebutted by a
16 preponderance of the evidence. No juvenile less than 14 18 years of age
17 shall be prosecuted as an adult.
18 (2) At any time after commencement of proceedings under this code
19 against a juvenile offender for an offense which that, if committed by an
20 adult, would constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1
21 through 4 person felony, and prior to the beginning of an evidentiary
22 hearing at which the court may enter a sentence as provided in K.S.A. 38-
23 2356, and amendments thereto, the county or district attorney or the
24 county or district attorney's designee may file a motion requesting that the
25 court designate the proceedings as an extended jurisdiction juvenile
26 prosecution.
27 (3) If the county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's
28 designee files a motion to designate the proceedings as an extended
29 jurisdiction juvenile prosecution, the burden of proof is on the prosecutor
30 to prove the juvenile should be designated as an extended jurisdiction
31 juvenile.
32 (b) (1) Upon receiving the motion, the court shall set a time and place
33 for hearing. The court shall give notice of the hearing to the juvenile, each
34 parent, if service is possible, and the attorney representing the juvenile.
35 The motion shall be heard and determined prior to any further proceedings

HB 2350 2
1 on the complaint.
2 (2) At the hearing, the court shall inform the juvenile of the
3 following:
4 (A) The nature of the charges in the complaint;
5 (B) the right of the juvenile to be presumed innocent of each charge;
6 (C) the right to trial without unnecessary delay and to confront and
7 cross-examine witnesses appearing in support of the allegations of the
8 complaint;
9 (D) the right to subpoena witnesses;
10 (E) the right of the juvenile to testify or to decline to testify; and
11 (F) the sentencing alternatives the court may select as the result of the
12 juvenile being prosecuted under an extended jurisdiction juvenile
13 prosecution.
14 (c) If the juvenile fails to appear for hearing on the motion after
15 having been served with notice of the hearing, the court may hear and
16 determine the motion in the absence of the juvenile. If the court is unable
17 to obtain service of process and give notice of the hearing, the court may
18 hear and determine the motion in the absence of the alleged juvenile
19 offender after having given notice of the hearing at least once a week for
20 two consecutive weeks in the official county newspaper of the county
21 where the hearing will be held.
22 (d) In determining whether or not prosecution as an adult should be
23 authorized or designating the proceeding as an extended jurisdiction
24 juvenile prosecution, the court shall consider each of the following factors:
25 (1) The seriousness of the alleged offense and whether the protection
26 of the community requires prosecution as an adult or designating the
27 proceeding as an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution;
28 (2) whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive,
29 violent, premeditated or willful manner;
30 (3) whether the offense was against a person or against property.
31 Greater weight shall be given to offenses against persons, especially if
32 personal injury resulted;
33 (4) the number of alleged offenses unadjudicated and pending against
34 the juvenile;
35 (5) the previous history of the juvenile, including whether the
36 juvenile had been adjudicated a juvenile offender under this code or the
37 Kansas juvenile justice code and, if so, whether the offenses were against
38 persons or property, and any other previous history of antisocial behavior
39 or patterns of physical violence;
40 (6) the sophistication or maturity of the juvenile as determined by
41 consideration of the juvenile's home, environment, emotional attitude,
42 pattern of living or desire to be treated as an adult;
43 (7) whether there are facilities or programs available to the court

HB 2350 3
1 which are likely to rehabilitate the juvenile prior to the expiration of the
2 court's jurisdiction under this code; and
3 (8) whether the interests of the juvenile or of the community would
4 be better served by criminal prosecution or extended jurisdiction juvenile
5 prosecution.
6 The insufficiency of evidence pertaining to any one or more of the
7 factors listed in this subsection, in and of itself, shall not be determinative
8 of the issue. Subject to the provisions of K.S.A. 38-2354, and amendments
9 thereto, written reports and other materials relating to the juvenile's
10 mental, physical, educational and social history may be considered by the
11 court.
12 (e) (1) The court may authorize prosecution as an adult upon
13 completion of the hearing if the court finds from a preponderance of the
14 evidence that the alleged juvenile offender should be prosecuted as an
15 adult for the offense charged. In that case, the court shall direct the alleged
16 juvenile offender be prosecuted under the applicable criminal statute and
17 that the proceedings filed under this code be dismissed.
18 (2) The court may designate the proceeding as an extended
19 jurisdiction juvenile prosecution upon completion of the hearing if the
20 court finds from a preponderance of the evidence that the juvenile should
21 be prosecuted under an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution.
22 (3) After a proceeding in which prosecution as an adult is requested
23 pursuant to subsection (a)(2), and prosecution as an adult is not authorized,
24 the court may designate the proceedings to be an extended jurisdiction
25 juvenile prosecution.
26 (4) A juvenile who is the subject of an extended jurisdiction juvenile
27 prosecution shall have the right to a trial by jury, to the effective assistance
28 of counsel and to all other rights of a defendant pursuant to the Kansas
29 code of criminal procedure. Each court shall adopt local rules to establish
30 the basic procedures for extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution in such
31 court's jurisdiction.
32 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 38-2347 is hereby repealed.
33 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
34 publication in the statute book.
