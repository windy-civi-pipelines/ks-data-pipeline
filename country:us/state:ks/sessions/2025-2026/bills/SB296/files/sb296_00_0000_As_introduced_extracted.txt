22 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
23 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the

23 2020, a taxpayer may elect to take an expense deduction from Kansas net
24 income before expensing or recapture allocated or apportioned to this state
25 for the cost of the following property placed in service in this state during
26 the taxable year: (1) Tangible property eligible for depreciation under the
27 modified accelerated cost recovery system in section 168 of the internal
28 revenue code, as amended, but not including residential rental property,
29 nonresidential real property, any railroad grading or tunnel bore or any
30 other property with an applicable recovery period in excess of 25 years as
31 defined under section 168(c) or (g) of the internal revenue code, as
32 amended; and (2) computer software as defined in section 197(e)(3)(B) of
33 the internal revenue code, as amended, and as described in section 197(e)
34 (3)(A)(i) of the internal revenue code, as amended, to which section 167 of
35 the internal revenue code, as amended, applies. If such election is made,
36 the amount of expense deduction for such cost shall equal the difference
37 between the depreciable cost of such property for federal income tax
38 purposes and the sum of the amount of bonus depreciation being claimed
39 for such property pursuant to section 168(k) and the amount of expensing
40 deduction being claimed for such property pursuant to section 179 of the
41 internal revenue code, as amended, for federal income tax purposes in such
42 tax year, multiplied by the applicable factor, determined by using, the table
43 provided in subsection (f), based on the method of depreciation selected
SB 296 23
1 pursuant to section 168(b)(1), (2), or (3) or (g) of the internal revenue
2 code, as amended, and the applicable recovery period for such property as
3 defined under section 168(c) or (g) of the internal revenue code, as
4 amended. This election shall be made by the due date of the original
5 return, including any extensions, and may be made only for the taxable
6 year in which the property is placed in service, and once made, shall be
7 irrevocable.
8 (b) If the amount of expense deduction calculated pursuant to
9 subsection (a) exceeds the taxpayer's Kansas net income before expensing
10 or recapture allocated or apportioned to this state, such excess amount
11 shall be treated as a Kansas net operating loss as provided in K.S.A. 79-
12 32,143, and amendments thereto.
13 (c) If the property for which an expense deduction is taken pursuant
14 to subsection (a) is subsequently sold during the applicable recovery
15 period for such property as defined under section 168(c) of the internal
16 revenue code, as amended, and in a manner that would cause recapture of
17 any previously taken expense or depreciation deductions for federal
18 income tax purposes, or if the situs of such property is otherwise changed
19 such that the property is relocated outside the state of Kansas during such
20 applicable recovery period, then the expense deduction determined
21 pursuant to subsection (a) shall be subject to recapture and treated as
22 Kansas taxable income allocated to this state. The amount of recapture
23 shall be the Kansas expense deduction determined pursuant to subsection
24 (a) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years
25 remaining in the applicable recovery period for such property as defined
26 under section 168(c) or (g) of the internal revenue code, as amended, after
27 such property is sold or removed from the state including the year of such
28 disposition, and the denominator of which is the total number of years in
29 such applicable recovery period.
30 (d) The situs of tangible property for purposes of claiming and
31 recapture of the expense deduction shall be the physical location of such
32 property. If such property is mobile, the situs shall be the physical location
33 of the business operations from where such property is used or based. The
34 situs of computer software shall be apportioned to Kansas based on the
35 fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the taxpayer's users
36 located in Kansas of licenses for such computer software used in the active
37 conduct of the taxpayer's business operations, and the denominator of
38 which is the total number of the taxpayer's users of the licenses for such
39 computer software used in the active conduct of the taxpayer's business
40 operations everywhere.
41 (e) Any member of a unitary group filing a combined report may
42 elect to take an expense deduction pursuant to subsection (a) for an
43 investment in property made by any member of the combined group,
SB 296 24
1 provided that the amount calculated pursuant to subsection (a) may only be
2 deducted from the Kansas net income before expensing or recapture
3 allocated to or apportioned to this state by such member making the
4 election.

6 deduction calculated pursuant to subsection (a):

10 or recapture allocated or apportioned to this state, such excess amount
11 shall be treated as a Kansas net operating loss as provided in K.S.A. 79-
12 32,143, and amendments thereto.

17 any previously taken expense or depreciation deductions for federal
18 income tax purposes, or if the situs of such property is otherwise changed
19 such that the property is relocated outside the state of Kansas during such
20 applicable recovery period, then the expense deduction determined

22 Kansas taxable income allocated to this state. The amount of recapture
23 shall be the Kansas expense deduction determined pursuant to subsection
24 (a) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years
25 remaining in the applicable recovery period for such property as defined

29 Sec. 10. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,160a is hereby amended to read as
30 follows: 79-32,160a. (a) For taxable years commencing after December
31 31, 1999, and before January 1, 2012, any taxpayer who shall invest in a
32 qualified business facility, as defined in K.S.A. 79-32,154(b), and
33 amendments thereto, and effective for tax years commencing after
34 December 31, 2010, and before January 1, 2012, located in an area other
35 than a metropolitan county as defined in either K.S.A. 74-50,114 or 74-
36 50,211, and amendments thereto, and also meets the definition of a
37 business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(b), and amendments thereto, shall be
38 allowed a credit for such investment, in an amount determined under
39 subsection (b) or (c), as the case requires, against the tax imposed by the
40 Kansas income tax act or where the qualified business facility is the
41 principal place from which the trade or business of the taxpayer is directed
42 or managed and the facility has facilitated the creation of at least 20 new
43 full-time positions, against the premium tax or privilege fees imposed

SB 296 26
1 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or as measured by the
2 net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to article 11 of
3 chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, for
4 the taxable year during which commencement of commercial operations,
5 as defined in K.S.A. 79-32,154(f), and amendments thereto, occurs at such
6 qualified business facility. In the case of a taxpayer who meets the
7 definition of a manufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(d), and
8 amendments thereto, no credit shall be allowed under this section unless
9 the number of qualified business facility employees, as determined under
10 K.S.A. 79-32,154(d), and amendments thereto, engaged or maintained in
11 employment at the qualified business facility as a direct result of the
12 investment by the taxpayer for the taxable year for which the credit is
13 claimed equals or exceeds two. In the case of a taxpayer who meets the
14 definition of a nonmanufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(f), and
15 amendments thereto, no credit shall be allowed under this section unless
16 the number of qualified business facility employees, as determined under
17 K.S.A. 79-32,154(d), and amendments thereto, engaged or maintained in
18 employment at the qualified business facility as a direct result of the
19 investment by the taxpayer for the taxable year for which the credit is
20 claimed equals or exceeds five. Where an employee performs services for
21 the taxpayer outside the qualified business facility, the employee shall be
22 considered engaged or maintained in employment at the qualified business
23 facility if: (1) The employee's service performed outside the qualified
24 business facility is incidental to the employee's service inside the qualified
25 business facility; or (2) the base of operations or, the place from which the
26 service is directed or controlled, is at the qualified business facility.
27 (b) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for any taxpayer who invests
28 in a qualified business facility that is located in a designated
29 nonmetropolitan region established under K.S.A. 74-50,116, and
30 amendments thereto, on or after the effective date of this act, shall be a
31 portion of the income tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the
32 taxpayer's Kansas taxable income, the premium tax or privilege fees
33 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the
34 privilege tax as measured by the net income of financial institutions
35 imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
36 Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year for which such
37 credit is allowed, but in the case where the qualified business facility
38 investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, not in excess of 50% of
39 such tax. Such portion shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
40 following:
41 (1) $2,500 for each qualified business facility employee determined
42 under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto; plus
43 (2) $1,000 for each $100,000, or major fraction thereof, which shall

SB 296 27
1 be deemed to be 51% or more, in qualified business facility investment, as
2 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto.
3 (c) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for any taxpayer who invests
4 in a qualified business facility that is not located in a nonmetropolitan
5 region established under K.S.A. 74-50,116, and amendments thereto, and
6 effective for tax years commencing after December 31, 2010, and before
7 January 1, 2012, located in an area other than a metropolitan county as
8 defined in either K.S.A. 74-50,114 or 74-50,211, and amendments thereto,
9 and that also meets the definition of business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(b), and
10 amendments thereto, on or after the effective date of this act, shall be a
11 portion of the income tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the
12 taxpayer's Kansas taxable income, the premium tax or privilege fees
13 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the
14 privilege tax as measured by the net income of financial institutions
15 imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
16 Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year for which such
17 credit is allowed, but in the case where the qualified business facility
18 investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, not in excess of 50% of
19 such tax. Such portion shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
20 following:
21 (1) $1,500 for each qualified business facility employee as
22 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto; and
23 (2) $1,000 for each $100,000, or major fraction thereof, which shall
24 be deemed to be 51% or more, in qualified business facility investment as
25 determined under K.S.A. 79-32,154, and amendments thereto.
26 (d) The credit allowed by subsection (a) for each qualified business
27 facility employee and for qualified business facility investment shall be a
28 one-time credit. If the amount of the credit allowed under subsection (a)
29 exceeds the tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act on the taxpayer's
30 Kansas taxable income, the premium tax and privilege fees imposed
31 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
32 measured by the net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
33 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
34 thereto, for the taxable year, or in the case where the qualified business
35 facility investment was made prior to January 1, 1996, 50% of such tax
36 imposed upon the amount which exceeds such tax liability or such portion
37 thereof may be carried over for credit in the same manner in the
38 succeeding taxable years until the total amount of such credit is used.
39 Except that, before the credit is allowed, a taxpayer, who meets the
40 definition of a manufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(d), and
41 amendments thereto, shall recertify annually that the net increase of a
42 minimum of two qualified business facility employees has continued to be
43 maintained and a taxpayer, who meets the definition of a

SB 296 28
1 nonmanufacturing business in K.S.A. 74-50,114(f), and amendments
2 thereto, shall recertify annually that the net increase of a minimum of five
3 qualified business employees has continued to be maintained.
4 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, and
5 except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any taxpayer qualified and
6 certified under the provisions of K.S.A. 74-50,131, and amendments
7 thereto, that prior to making a commitment to invest in a qualified Kansas
8 business, has filed a certificate of intent to invest in a qualified business
9 facility in a form satisfactory to the secretary of commerce, shall be
10 entitled to a credit in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the
11 qualified business facility investment that exceeds $50,000 in lieu of the
12 credit provided in subsection (b)(2) or (c)(2) without regard to the number
13 of qualified business facility employees engaged or maintained in
14 employment at the qualified business facility. For tax years beginning on
15 or after January 1, 2012, for a qualified business facility investment in
16 Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee or Wyandotte county, such credit
17 shall be in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the qualified business
18 facility investment that exceeds $1,000,000. Any taxpayer who has filed a
19 certificate of intent to invest in a qualified business facility pursuant to this
20 subsection in Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee or Wyandotte county
21 prior to December 31, 2011, and commences investments in a qualified
22 business facility prior to December 31, 2013, may claim credits under
23 K.S.A. 74-50,131, 74-50,132 and 79-32,160a(e), and amendments thereto,
24 in an amount equal to 10% of that portion of the qualified business facility
25 investment that exceeds $50,000. Timing modifications may be authorized
26 at the discretion of the secretary of commerce and the secretary of revenue
27 during the transition period. The credit allowed by this subsection shall be
28 a one-time credit. If the amount thereof exceeds the tax imposed by the
29 Kansas income tax act on the taxpayer's Kansas taxable income or the
30 premium tax or privilege fees imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and
31 amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as measured by net income of
32 financial institutions imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the
33 Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, for the taxable year,
34 the amount thereof that exceeds such tax liability may be carried forward
35 for credit in the succeeding taxable year or years until the total amount of
36 the tax credit is used, except that no such tax credit shall be carried
37 forward for deduction after the 16th taxable year succeeding the taxable
38 year in which such credit initially was claimed, and no carryforward shall
39 be allowed for deduction in any succeeding taxable year unless the
40 taxpayer certifies under oath that the taxpayer continues to meet the
41 requirements of K.S.A. 74-50,131, and amendments thereto, and this act.
42 In no event shall any credit allowed under this section that expired during
43 any taxable year prior to the taxable year commencing January 1, 2011, be

SB 296 29
1 revived under the provisions of this act.
2 (f) For projects placed into service on and after January 1, 2021, a
3 taxpayer may transfer up to 50% of the tax credit allowed under subsection
4 (e), as provided in this subsection. The taxpayer may make a transfer to
5 one or more transferees, but the total of all transfers shall not exceed 50%
6 of the taxpayer's tax credit. The taxpayer shall make the transfer or
7 transfers within a single tax year. The credit may be transferred to any
8 individual or entity and shall be claimed in the year the credit was
9 transferred against the transferee's tax liability for the income tax under the
10 Kansas income tax act or the premium tax or privilege fees imposed
11 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
12 measured by the net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
13 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
14 thereto. The amount of the credit that exceeds the transferee's tax liability
15 for such year may be carried forward for credit in the succeeding taxable
16 year or years until the total amount of the tax credit is used, except that no
17 such credit shall be carried forward for deduction after the 16th taxable
18 year succeeding the taxable year in which such credit was initially
19 claimed. The taxpayer or transferee shall provide such documentation of
20 the tax credit transfer to the secretary of revenue as may be required by the
21 secretary.
22 (g) In the event the tax credit earned by the taxpayer and transferred
23 to a transferee is later disallowed in whole or in part by the secretary of
24 revenue, the taxpayer that originally earned the tax credit shall be liable for
25 repayment to the state in the amount disallowed.
26 (h) For tax years commencing after December 31, 2005, any taxpayer
27 claiming credits pursuant to this section, as a condition for claiming and
28 qualifying for such credits, shall provide information pursuant to K.S.A.
29 79-32,243, and amendments thereto, as part of the tax return in which such
30 credits are claimed. Such credits shall not be denied solely on the basis of
31 the contents of the information provided by the taxpayer pursuant to
32 K.S.A. 79-32,243, and amendments thereto.
33 (i) This section and K.S.A. 79-32,160b, and amendments thereto,
34 shall be a part of and supplemental to the job expansion and investment
35 credit act of 1976, and amendments thereto.
