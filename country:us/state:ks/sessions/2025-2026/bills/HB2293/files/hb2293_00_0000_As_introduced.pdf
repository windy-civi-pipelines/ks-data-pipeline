16 equipment that were acquired prior to July 1, 2025, and that are not in
17 compliance with subsection (a) may continue to be used by the
18 governmental agency that acquired such critical components. When a
19 governmental agency determines that a critical component must be
20 replaced, the governmental agency may use any replacement component
21 acquired prior to July 1, 2025, but no new replacement component shall be
22 acquired from any foreign principal.
23 (c) Any acquisition that is otherwise prohibited under subsection (a)
24 or (b) may be completed by a governmental agency if:

26 components or of addressing the needs of the governmental agency
27 necessitating such acquisition;
28 (2) the agreement for such acquisition is approved by the secretary of
29 administration after consultation with the adjutant general; and
30 (3) failure to acquire such critical components or otherwise address
31 the needs of the governmental agency would pose a greater threat to the
32 safety and security of this state than that posed by entering into such
33 acquisition agreement.

35 agreement entered into prior to July 1, 2025.
