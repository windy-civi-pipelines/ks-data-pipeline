revenue code are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit
derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of
such section; or
(ii) the requirements of section 415(c) of the federal internal
revenue code are met, determined by treating all such contributions as
annual additions for purposes of such section. For purposes of applying
clause (i) a retirement plan shall not fail to meet the reduced limit under

Section 13:
section 415(b)(2)(C) of the federal internal revenue code solely by
reason of this subparagraph (C), and for purposes of applying clause
(ii), a retirement plan shall not fail to meet the percentage limitation
under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the federal internal revenue code solely
by reason of this paragraph.
(iii) For purposes of this clause, the term "permissive service
credit" means service credit:
(a) Specifically recognized by a retirement plan's law for purposes
of calculating a member's benefit under that retirement plan;
(b) that such member has not received under a retirement plan;
and
(c) that such member may receive under a retirement plan's law
only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount
determined under the retirement plan's law and procedures established
by the board, that does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the
benefit attributable to such service credit.
(iv) A retirement plan shall fail to meet the requirements of this
clause if the retirement plan's law specifically provides for a purchase
of nonqualified service purchase, and if:
(a) More than five years of nonqualified service credit are taken
into account for purposes of this subclause; or
(b) any nonqualified service credit is taken into account under this
subclause before the member has at least five years of participation
under a retirement plan. For purposes of this subclause, effective for
permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years
beginning after December 31, 1997, the term "nonqualified service
SENATE BILL No. 64—page 10
credit" means the same as provided in section 415(n)(3)(C) of the
federal internal revenue code.
(v) In the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer after December 31,
2001, to which section 403(b)(13)(A) or 457(e)(17)(A) of the federal
internal revenue code applies, without regard to whether the transfer is
made between plans maintained by the same employer:
(a) The limitations of clause (iv) shall not apply in determining
whether the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credit;
and
(b) the distribution rules applicable under federal law to a
retirement plan shall apply to such amounts and any benefits
attributable to such amounts.
(vi) For an eligible member, the limitation of section 415(c)(1) of
the federal internal revenue code shall not be applied to reduce the
amount of permissive service credit which may be purchased to an
amount less than the amount which was allowed to be purchased under
the terms of the statute as in effect on August 5, 1997. For purposes of
this clause, an eligible member is an individual who first became a
member in the retirement plan before January 1, 1998.
(D) Subject to approval by the internal revenue service, the board
shall maintain a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement
under section 415(m) of the federal internal revenue code. The board
shall establish the necessary and appropriate procedures for the
administration of such benefit arrangement under the federal internal
revenue code. The amount of any annual benefit that would exceed the
limitations imposed by section 415 of the federal internal revenue code
shall be paid from this benefit arrangement. The amount of any
contribution that would exceed the limitations imposed by section 415
of the federal internal revenue code shall be credited to this benefit
arrangement. The qualified excess benefit arrangement shall be a
separate portion of the retirement plan. The qualified excess benefit
arrangement is subject to the following requirements:
(i) The benefit arrangement shall be maintained solely for the
purpose of providing to participants in the retirement plans that part of
the participant's annual benefit otherwise payable under the terms of the
act that exceeds the limitations on benefits imposed by section 415 of
the federal internal revenue code; and
(ii) participants do not have an election, directly or indirectly, to
defer compensation to the excess benefit arrangement.
(E) For purposes of applying these limits only and for no other
purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable shall be
compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year,
except as noted below and as permitted by treasury regulation section

Section 14:
1.415(c)-2. Specifically, compensation shall be defined as wages within
the meaning of section 3401(a) of the federal internal revenue code and
all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for
which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written
statement under sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 of the federal
internal revenue code. Compensation shall be determined without
regard to any rules under section 3401(a) of the federal internal revenue
code that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature
or location of the employment or the services performed, such as the
exception for agricultural labor in section 3401(a)(2) of the federal
internal revenue code.
(i) However, for limitation years beginning after December 31,
1997, compensation shall also include amounts that would otherwise be
included in compensation but for an election under sections 125(a),
402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b) of the federal internal
revenue code. For limitation years beginning after December 30, 2000,
SENATE BILL No. 64—page 11
compensation shall also include any elective amounts that are not
includable in the gross income of the employee by reason of section
132(f)(4) of the federal internal revenue code.
(ii) The definition of compensation shall exclude employee
contributions picked up under section 414(h)(2) of the federal internal
revenue code.
(iii) For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007,
compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation
paid by the later of two and a half months after an employee's
severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that
includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if:
(a) The payment is regular compensation for services during the
employee's regular working hours or compensation for services outside
the employee's regular working hours, such as overtime or shift
differential, commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and
absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been
paid to the employee while the employee continues in employment
with the employer;
(b) the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or
other leave that the employee would have been able to use if
employment had continued; or
(c) for limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2012, the
payment is made pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred
compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to
the member at the same time if the member had continued employment
with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includable
in the member's gross income.
(iv) Any payments not described in clause (iii) are not considered
compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are
paid within two and a half months following severance from
employment, except for payments to the individual who does not
currently perform services for the employer by reason of qualified
military service, within the meaning of section 414(u)(1) of the federal
internal revenue code, to the extent these payments do not exceed the
amounts the individual would have received if the individual had
continued to perform services for the employer rather than entering
qualified military service.
(v) An employee who is in qualified military service, within the
meaning of section 414(u)(1) of the federal internal revenue code, shall
be treated as receiving compensation from the employer during such
period of qualified military service equal to: (a) The compensation the
employee would have received during such period if the employee
were not in qualified military service, determined based on the rate of
pay the employee would have received from the employer but for the
absence during the period of qualified military service; or (b) if the
compensation the employee would have received during such period
was not reasonably certain, the employee's average compensation from
the employer during the 12-month period immediately preceding the
qualified military service, or if shorter, the period of employment
immediately preceding the qualified military service.
(vi) Back pay, within the meaning of treasury regulation section

Section 15:
1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation
year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents
wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this
definition.
(7) On and after January 1, 2009, for purposes of applying the
limits under section 415(b) of the federal internal revenue code, the
following shall apply:
(A) A member's applicable limit shall be applied to the member's
SENATE BILL No. 64—page 12
annual benefit in the first limitation year without regard to any
automatic cost-of-living increases;
(B) to the extent the member's annual benefit equals or exceeds
such limit, the member shall no longer be eligible for cost-of-living
increases until such time as the benefit plus the accumulated increases
are less than such limit;
(C) thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, the member's
annual benefit including any automatic cost-of-living increase
applicable shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit
including any adjustment to the dollar limit under section 415(b)(1)(A)
or 415(d) of the federal internal revenue code and the regulations
thereunder; and
(D) in no event shall a member's annual benefit payable from a
retirement plan in any limitation year be greater than the limit
applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years
pursuant to section 415(d) of the federal internal revenue code and the
regulations thereunder. If the form of benefit without regard to the
automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the
preceding sentence is applied by reducing the limit under section
415(b) of the federal internal revenue code applicable at the annuity
starting date to an actuarially equivalent amount determined using the
assumptions specified in treasury regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)
that take into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. This
subsection applies to distributions made on and after January 1, 1993. A
distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee in a transfer made from the retirement system.
(i) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
eligible rollover distribution does not include: (a) Any distribution that
is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less
frequently than annually, made for the life or the life expectancy of the
distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee
and the distributee's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of
10 years or more; (b) any distribution to the extent such distribution is
required under section 401(a)(9) of the federal internal revenue code;
(c) the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income; and (d) any other distribution that is reasonably expected to
total less than $200 during the year. Effective January 1, 2002, a
portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover
distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions that are not includable in gross income. However, such
portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or
annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the federal internal
revenue code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in

Section 16:
section 401(a) of the federal internal revenue code or to a qualified plan
described in section 403(a) of the federal internal revenue code, that
agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred and earnings on
such amounts, including separately accounting for the portion of the
distribution that is includable in gross income and the portion of the
distribution that is not so includable, or on or after January 1, 2007, to a
qualified defined benefit plan described in section 401(a) of the federal
internal revenue code or to an annuity contract described in section
403(b) of the federal internal revenue code, that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred and earnings thereon, including
separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is
includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not
so includable.
(ii) An eligible retirement plan is any of the following that accepts
SENATE BILL No. 64—page 13
the distributee's eligible rollover distribution:
(a) An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of
the federal internal revenue code;
(b) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of
the federal internal revenue code;
(c) an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the federal
internal revenue code;
(d) a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the federal
internal revenue code;
(e) effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in

Section 17:
section 403(b) of the federal internal revenue code;
(f) effective January 1, 2002, a plan eligible under section 457(b)
of the federal internal revenue code that is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state or any agency or instrumentality of a
state or a political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately
account for amounts transferred into the plan from a retirement plan; or
(g) effective January 1, 2008, a roth IRA described in section
408(A) of the federal internal revenue code; or
(h) effective January 1, 2016, a SIMPLE IRA, as described in

Section 18:
section 408(p) of the federal internal revenue code, provided that the
rollover contribution is made after the two-year period described in

Section 19:
section 72(t)(6) of the federal internal revenue code.
(iii) Effective January 1, 2002, the definition of eligible rollover
distribution also includes a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a
spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a domestic
relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the federal internal
revenue code.
(iv) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It
also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse
and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who
is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in section 414(p) of the federal internal revenue code. Effective
July 1, 2007, a distributee further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who
is a designated beneficiary as defined by section 401(a)(9)(E) of the
federal internal revenue code. However, a nonspouse beneficiary may
rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or
individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving
the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an
"inherited" individual retirement account or annuity.
(v) A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
(8) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board may accept
a direct or indirect eligible rollover distributions for the purpose of the
purchase of service credit. In addition, the board may accept a direct
trustee to trustee transfer from a deferred compensation plan under

Section 20:
section 457(b) of the federal internal revenue code or a tax sheltered
annuity under section 403(b) of the federal internal revenue code for:
(A) The purchase of permissive service credit, as defined under section
415(n)(3)(A) of the federal internal revenue code; or (B) a repayment to
which section 415 of the federal internal revenue code does not apply
pursuant to section 415(k)(3) of the federal internal revenue code. Any
such transfer shall be allowed as provided in this subsection to the
extent permitted by law, subject to any conditions, proofs or acceptance
established or required by the board or the board's designee.
(9) Where required by the act, an employer shall pick up and pay
contributions that would otherwise be payable by members of a
retirement plan in accordance with section 414(h)(2) of the federal
internal revenue code as follows:
(A) The contributions, although designated as employee
SENATE BILL No. 64—page 14

by the employee;
(B) the employee must not have been given the option of receiving
the amounts directly instead of having them paid to the retirement plan;
and
(C) the pickup shall apply to amounts that a member elects to
contribute to receive credit for prior or participating service if the
election is irrevocable and applies to amounts contributed before
retirement.
(10) (A) Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the
contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to
qualified military service will be provided in accordance with section
414(u) of the federal internal revenue code and the uniformed services
employment and reemployment rights act of 1994.

survivors of a member in the system, are entitled to any additional
benefits that the system would provide if the member had resumed
employment and then died, such as accelerated vesting or survivor
benefits that are contingent on the member's death while employed. A
deceased member's period of qualified military service must be counted
for vesting purposes.
(C) Effective with respect to deaths or disabilities, or both,
occurring on or after January 1, 2007, while a member is performing
qualified military service, as defined in chapter 43 of title 38, United
States code, to the extent permitted by section 414(u)(9) of the federal
internal revenue code, for the benefit accrual purposes and in the case
of death, for vesting purposes, the member will be treated as having
earned years of service for the period of qualified military service,
having returned to employment on the day before the death or
disability, or both, and then having terminated on the date of death or
disability. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated
individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.
(D) Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section
414(u)(12) of the federal internal revenue code, an individual receiving
differential wage payments, as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the
federal internal revenue code, from an employer shall be treated as
employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be
treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual
additions under section 415(c) of the federal internal revenue code.
This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a
reasonably equivalent manner.
(11) Upon the complete or partial termination of a retirement plan,
the rights of members to benefits accrued to the date of termination, to
the extent funded, or to the amounts in their accounts are
nonforfeitable, and amounts in their accounts may be distributed to

Supp. 74-49,123 and repealing the existing sections.
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
Section 1. K.S.A. 74-4902 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
(3) "actuarial equivalent" means an annuity or benefit of equal
value to the accumulated contributions, annuity or benefit, when
computed upon the basis of the actuarial tables in use by the system.
Whenever the amount of any benefit is to be determined on the basis of
actuarial assumptions, the assumptions shall be specified in a way that
precludes employer discretion;
(4) "actuarial tables" means the actuarial tables approved and in
use by the board at any given time;
(5) "actuary" means the actuary or firm of actuaries employed or
retained by the board at any given time;
(6) "agent" means the individual designated by each participating
employer through whom system transactions and communication are
directed;
(7) "beneficiary" means, subject to the provisions of K.S.A. 74-
4927, and amendments thereto, any natural person or persons, estate or
trust, or any combination thereof, named by a member to receive any
benefits as provided for by this act. Designations of beneficiaries by a
member who is a member of more than one retirement system made on
or after July 1, 1987, shall be the basis of any benefits payable under all
systems unless otherwise provided by law. Except as otherwise
provided by subsection (33) of this section (32), if there is no named
beneficiary living at the time of the member's death, any benefits
provided for by this act shall be paid to: (A) The member's surviving
spouse; (B) the member's dependent child or children; (C) the member's

retirement incentive program made prior to the retirement of the
member. Beginning with the employer's fiscal year which that begins in
calendar year 1991 or for employers other than the state of Kansas,
beginning with the fiscal year which that begins in calendar year 1992,
when the compensation of a member who remains in substantially the
same position during any two consecutive years of participating service
used in calculating final average salary is increased by an amount

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 2
which exceeds 15%, then the amount of such increase which exceeds
15% shall not be included in compensation, except that: (A) Any
amount of compensation for accumulated sick leave or vacation or
annual leave paid to the member; (B) any increase in compensation for
any member due to a reclassification or reallocation of such member's
position or a reassignment of such member's job classification to a
higher range or level; and (C) any increase in compensation as provided
in any contract entered into prior to January 1, 1991, and still in force
on the effective date of this act, pursuant to an early retirement
incentive program as provided in K.S.A. 72-5395 et seq., and
amendments thereto, shall be included in the amount of compensation
of such member used in determining such member's final average
salary and shall not be subject to the 15% limitation provided in this
subsection. Any contributions by such member on the amount of such
increase which exceeds 15% which is not included in compensation
shall be returned to the member. Unless otherwise provided by law,

appropriate, any other section of the federal internal revenue code of
1986 which defers or excludes amounts from inclusion in income. For
purposes of applying limits under the federal internal revenue code
"compensation" shall have the meaning as provided in K.S.A. 74-
49,123, and amendments thereto. For purposes of this subsection and
application to the provisions of subsection (4) of K.S.A. 74-4927(4),
and amendments thereto, "compensation" shall not include any
payments made by the state board of regents pursuant to the provisions
of subsection (5) of K.S.A. 74-4927a(5), and amendments thereto, to a

county, city, township, special district or any instrumentality of any one
or several of the aforementioned or any noncommercial public

funds allocated by the Kansas public broadcasting commission whose

in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of

distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before
the member's death and no longer than the remaining period over which

benefits has begun, the member's entire interest must be either:
(i) In accordance with federal regulations, distributed over the life
or life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, with the distributions
beginning no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately
following the calendar year of the member's death; or
(ii) distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the

(5) The board or its designee may not:
(A) Determine eligibility for benefits;

that discriminates in favor of members who are considered officers,
supervisors or highly compensated, as prohibited under section 401(a)
(4) of the federal internal revenue code.
(6) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, benefits paid from,
and employee contributions made to, the retirement plans shall not
exceed the maximum benefits and the maximum annual additions,
respectively, permissible under section 415 of the federal internal
revenue code.
(A) Before January 1, 1995, a member may not receive an annual

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 9
benefit that exceeds the limits specified in section 415(b) of the federal
internal revenue code, subject to the applicable adjustments in that
section. Beginning January 1, 1995, a participant may not receive an
annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in section
415(b)(1)(A) of the federal internal revenue code, subject to the
applicable adjustments in section 415 of the federal internal revenue
code.
(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
the board may modify a request by a participant to make a contribution
to the retirement plans if the amount of the contribution would exceed
the limits under section 415(c) or 415(n) of the federal internal revenue
code subject to the following:
(i) Where the retirement plan's law requires a lump-sum payment,
for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic
payment plan in order to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits
under section 415(c) or 415(n) of the federal internal revenue code.
(ii) If the board's option under clause (i) will not avoid a
contribution in excess of the limits under section 415(c) or 415(n) of
the federal internal revenue code, the board shall reduce or deny the
contribution.
(C) Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in
limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if an active
member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive
service credit under a retirement plan, then the requirements of this
section shall be treated as met only if:
(i) The requirements of section 415(b) of the federal internal
revenue code are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit
derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of
such section; or
(ii) the requirements of section 415(c) of the federal internal
revenue code are met, determined by treating all such contributions as
annual additions for purposes of such section. For purposes of applying
clause (i) a retirement plan shall not fail to meet the reduced limit under
section 415(b)(2)(C) of the federal internal revenue code solely by
reason of this subparagraph (C), and for purposes of applying clause
(ii), a retirement plan shall not fail to meet the percentage limitation
under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the federal internal revenue code solely
by reason of this paragraph.
(iii) For purposes of this clause, the term "permissive service
credit" means service credit:
(a) Specifically recognized by a retirement plan's law for purposes
of calculating a member's benefit under that retirement plan;
(b) that such member has not received under a retirement plan;
and
(c) that such member may receive under a retirement plan's law
only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount
determined under the retirement plan's law and procedures established
by the board, that does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the
benefit attributable to such service credit.
(iv) A retirement plan shall fail to meet the requirements of this
clause if the retirement plan's law specifically provides for a purchase
of nonqualified service purchase, and if:
(a) More than five years of nonqualified service credit are taken
into account for purposes of this subclause; or
(b) any nonqualified service credit is taken into account under this
subclause before the member has at least five years of participation
under a retirement plan. For purposes of this subclause, effective for
permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years
beginning after December 31, 1997, the term "nonqualified service

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 10
credit" means the same as provided in section 415(n)(3)(C) of the
federal internal revenue code.
(v) In the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer after December 31,
2001, to which section 403(b)(13)(A) or 457(e)(17)(A) of the federal
internal revenue code applies, without regard to whether the transfer is
made between plans maintained by the same employer:
(a) The limitations of clause (iv) shall not apply in determining
whether the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credit;
and
(b) the distribution rules applicable under federal law to a
retirement plan shall apply to such amounts and any benefits
attributable to such amounts.
(vi) For an eligible member, the limitation of section 415(c)(1) of
the federal internal revenue code shall not be applied to reduce the
amount of permissive service credit which may be purchased to an
amount less than the amount which was allowed to be purchased under
the terms of the statute as in effect on August 5, 1997. For purposes of
this clause, an eligible member is an individual who first became a
member in the retirement plan before January 1, 1998.
(D) Subject to approval by the internal revenue service, the board
shall maintain a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement
under section 415(m) of the federal internal revenue code. The board
shall establish the necessary and appropriate procedures for the
administration of such benefit arrangement under the federal internal
revenue code. The amount of any annual benefit that would exceed the
limitations imposed by section 415 of the federal internal revenue code
shall be paid from this benefit arrangement. The amount of any
contribution that would exceed the limitations imposed by section 415
of the federal internal revenue code shall be credited to this benefit
arrangement. The qualified excess benefit arrangement shall be a
separate portion of the retirement plan. The qualified excess benefit
arrangement is subject to the following requirements:
(i) The benefit arrangement shall be maintained solely for the
purpose of providing to participants in the retirement plans that part of
the participant's annual benefit otherwise payable under the terms of the
act that exceeds the limitations on benefits imposed by section 415 of
the federal internal revenue code; and
(ii) participants do not have an election, directly or indirectly, to
defer compensation to the excess benefit arrangement.
(E) For purposes of applying these limits only and for no other
purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable shall be
compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year,
except as noted below and as permitted by treasury regulation section
1.415(c)-2. Specifically, compensation shall be defined as wages within
the meaning of section 3401(a) of the federal internal revenue code and
all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for
which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written
statement under sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 of the federal
internal revenue code. Compensation shall be determined without
regard to any rules under section 3401(a) of the federal internal revenue
code that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature
or location of the employment or the services performed, such as the
exception for agricultural labor in section 3401(a)(2) of the federal
internal revenue code.
(i) However, for limitation years beginning after December 31,
1997, compensation shall also include amounts that would otherwise be
included in compensation but for an election under sections 125(a),
402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b) of the federal internal
revenue code. For limitation years beginning after December 30, 2000,

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 11
compensation shall also include any elective amounts that are not
includable in the gross income of the employee by reason of section
132(f)(4) of the federal internal revenue code.
(ii) The definition of compensation shall exclude employee
contributions picked up under section 414(h)(2) of the federal internal
revenue code.
(iii) For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007,
compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation
paid by the later of two and a half months after an employee's
severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that
includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if:
(a) The payment is regular compensation for services during the
employee's regular working hours or compensation for services outside
the employee's regular working hours, such as overtime or shift
differential, commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and
absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been
paid to the employee while the employee continues in employment
with the employer;
(b) the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or
other leave that the employee would have been able to use if
employment had continued; or
(c) for limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2012, the
payment is made pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred
compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to
the member at the same time if the member had continued employment
with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includable
in the member's gross income.
(iv) Any payments not described in clause (iii) are not considered
compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are
paid within two and a half months following severance from
employment, except for payments to the individual who does not
currently perform services for the employer by reason of qualified
military service, within the meaning of section 414(u)(1) of the federal
internal revenue code, to the extent these payments do not exceed the
amounts the individual would have received if the individual had
continued to perform services for the employer rather than entering
qualified military service.
(v) An employee who is in qualified military service, within the
meaning of section 414(u)(1) of the federal internal revenue code, shall
be treated as receiving compensation from the employer during such
period of qualified military service equal to: (a) The compensation the
employee would have received during such period if the employee
were not in qualified military service, determined based on the rate of
pay the employee would have received from the employer but for the
absence during the period of qualified military service; or (b) if the
compensation the employee would have received during such period
was not reasonably certain, the employee's average compensation from
the employer during the 12-month period immediately preceding the
qualified military service, or if shorter, the period of employment
immediately preceding the qualified military service.
(vi) Back pay, within the meaning of treasury regulation section
1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation
year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents
wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this
definition.
(7) On and after January 1, 2009, for purposes of applying the
limits under section 415(b) of the federal internal revenue code, the
following shall apply:
(A) A member's applicable limit shall be applied to the member's

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 12
annual benefit in the first limitation year without regard to any
automatic cost-of-living increases;
(B) to the extent the member's annual benefit equals or exceeds
such limit, the member shall no longer be eligible for cost-of-living
increases until such time as the benefit plus the accumulated increases
are less than such limit;
(C) thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, the member's
annual benefit including any automatic cost-of-living increase
applicable shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit
including any adjustment to the dollar limit under section 415(b)(1)(A)
or 415(d) of the federal internal revenue code and the regulations
thereunder; and
(D) in no event shall a member's annual benefit payable from a
retirement plan in any limitation year be greater than the limit
applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years
pursuant to section 415(d) of the federal internal revenue code and the
regulations thereunder. If the form of benefit without regard to the
automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the
preceding sentence is applied by reducing the limit under section
415(b) of the federal internal revenue code applicable at the annuity
starting date to an actuarially equivalent amount determined using the
assumptions specified in treasury regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)
that take into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. This
subsection applies to distributions made on and after January 1, 1993. A
distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the
distributee in a transfer made from the retirement system.
(i) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
eligible rollover distribution does not include: (a) Any distribution that
is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less
frequently than annually, made for the life or the life expectancy of the
distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee
and the distributee's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of
10 years or more; (b) any distribution to the extent such distribution is
required under section 401(a)(9) of the federal internal revenue code;
(c) the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income; and (d) any other distribution that is reasonably expected to
total less than $200 during the year. Effective January 1, 2002, a
portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover
distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee
contributions that are not includable in gross income. However, such
portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or
annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the federal internal
revenue code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in
section 401(a) of the federal internal revenue code or to a qualified plan
described in section 403(a) of the federal internal revenue code, that
agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred and earnings on
such amounts, including separately accounting for the portion of the
distribution that is includable in gross income and the portion of the
distribution that is not so includable, or on or after January 1, 2007, to a
qualified defined benefit plan described in section 401(a) of the federal
internal revenue code or to an annuity contract described in section
403(b) of the federal internal revenue code, that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred and earnings thereon, including
separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is
includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not
so includable.
(ii) An eligible retirement plan is any of the following that accepts

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 13
the distributee's eligible rollover distribution:
(a) An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of
the federal internal revenue code;
(b) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of
the federal internal revenue code;
(c) an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the federal
internal revenue code;
(d) a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the federal
internal revenue code;
(e) effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in
section 403(b) of the federal internal revenue code;
(f) effective January 1, 2002, a plan eligible under section 457(b)
of the federal internal revenue code that is maintained by a state,
political subdivision of a state or any agency or instrumentality of a
state or a political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately
account for amounts transferred into the plan from a retirement plan; or
(g) effective January 1, 2008, a roth IRA described in section
408(A) of the federal internal revenue code; or
(h) effective January 1, 2016, a SIMPLE IRA, as described in
section 408(p) of the federal internal revenue code, provided that the
rollover contribution is made after the two-year period described in
section 72(t)(6) of the federal internal revenue code.
(iii) Effective January 1, 2002, the definition of eligible rollover
distribution also includes a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a
spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a domestic
relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the federal internal
revenue code.
(iv) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It
also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse
and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who
is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as
defined in section 414(p) of the federal internal revenue code. Effective
July 1, 2007, a distributee further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who
is a designated beneficiary as defined by section 401(a)(9)(E) of the
federal internal revenue code. However, a nonspouse beneficiary may
rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or
individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving
the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an
"inherited" individual retirement account or annuity.
(v) A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
(8) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board may accept
a direct or indirect eligible rollover distributions for the purpose of the
purchase of service credit. In addition, the board may accept a direct
trustee to trustee transfer from a deferred compensation plan under
section 457(b) of the federal internal revenue code or a tax sheltered
annuity under section 403(b) of the federal internal revenue code for:
(A) The purchase of permissive service credit, as defined under section
415(n)(3)(A) of the federal internal revenue code; or (B) a repayment to
which section 415 of the federal internal revenue code does not apply
pursuant to section 415(k)(3) of the federal internal revenue code. Any
such transfer shall be allowed as provided in this subsection to the
extent permitted by law, subject to any conditions, proofs or acceptance
established or required by the board or the board's designee.
(9) Where required by the act, an employer shall pick up and pay
contributions that would otherwise be payable by members of a
retirement plan in accordance with section 414(h)(2) of the federal
internal revenue code as follows:
(A) The contributions, although designated as employee

SENATE BILL No. 64—page 14
contributions, are being paid by the employer in lieu of contributions
by the employee;
(B) the employee must not have been given the option of receiving
the amounts directly instead of having them paid to the retirement plan;
and
(C) the pickup shall apply to amounts that a member elects to
contribute to receive credit for prior or participating service if the
election is irrevocable and applies to amounts contributed before
retirement.
(10) (A) Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the
contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to
qualified military service will be provided in accordance with section
414(u) of the federal internal revenue code and the uniformed services
employment and reemployment rights act of 1994.
(B) Effective with respect to deaths occurring on or after January
1, 2007, while a member is performing qualified military service, as
defined in chapter 43 of title 38, United States code, to the extent
required by section 401(a)(37) of the federal internal revenue code,
survivors of a member in the system, are entitled to any additional
benefits that the system would provide if the member had resumed
employment and then died, such as accelerated vesting or survivor
benefits that are contingent on the member's death while employed. A
deceased member's period of qualified military service must be counted
for vesting purposes.
(C) Effective with respect to deaths or disabilities, or both,
occurring on or after January 1, 2007, while a member is performing
qualified military service, as defined in chapter 43 of title 38, United
States code, to the extent permitted by section 414(u)(9) of the federal
internal revenue code, for the benefit accrual purposes and in the case
of death, for vesting purposes, the member will be treated as having
earned years of service for the period of qualified military service,
having returned to employment on the day before the death or
disability, or both, and then having terminated on the date of death or
disability. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated
individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.
(D) Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section
414(u)(12) of the federal internal revenue code, an individual receiving
differential wage payments, as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the
federal internal revenue code, from an employer shall be treated as
employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be
treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual
additions under section 415(c) of the federal internal revenue code.
This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a
reasonably equivalent manner.
(11) Upon the complete or partial termination of a retirement plan,
the rights of members to benefits accrued to the date of termination, to
the extent funded, or to the amounts in their accounts are
nonforfeitable, and amounts in their accounts may be distributed to
them.
