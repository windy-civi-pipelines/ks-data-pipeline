38 a member, the member's spouse or the member's beneficiary may not be
39 recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining
40 benefits.
41 (D) If a member dies after the required distribution of benefits has
42 begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed
43 at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's

SB 64 11
1 death and no longer than the remaining period over which distributions
2 commenced.
3 (E) If a member dies before required distribution of the member's
4 benefits has begun, the member's entire interest must be either:
5 (i) In accordance with federal regulations, distributed over the life or
6 life expectancy of the designated beneficiary, with the distributions
7 beginning no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately
8 following the calendar year of the member's death; or
9 (ii) distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the
10 fifth anniversary of the member's death.
11 (F) The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not
12 exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit
13 requirement of the federal internal revenue code.
14 (G) The death and disability benefits provided by a retirement plan
15 are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in section 401(a)(9)(G)
16 of the federal internal revenue code and applicable treasury regulation
17 1.401-1(b)(l)(i) regulations.
18 (H) Distributions from a defined contribution or deferred
19 compensation plan shall be made in accordance with the rules under
20 section 401(a)(9) of the federal internal revenue code that are specific to
21 such plans.
22 (4) Distributions from the retirement plans may be made only upon
23 retirement, separation from service, disability or death.
24 (5) The board or its designee may not:
25 (A) Determine eligibility for benefits;
26 (B) compute rates of contribution; or
27 (C) compute benefits of members or beneficiaries, in a manner that
28 discriminates in favor of members who are considered officers, supervisors
29 or highly compensated, as prohibited under section 401(a)(4) of the federal
30 internal revenue code.
31 (6) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, benefits paid from,
32 and employee contributions made to, the retirement plans shall not exceed
33 the maximum benefits and the maximum annual additions, respectively,
34 permissible under section 415 of the federal internal revenue code.
35 (A) Before January 1, 1995, a member may not receive an annual
36 benefit that exceeds the limits specified in section 415(b) of the federal
37 internal revenue code, subject to the applicable adjustments in that section.
38 Beginning January 1, 1995, a participant may not receive an annual benefit
39 that exceeds the dollar amount specified in section 415(b)(1)(A) of the
40 federal internal revenue code, subject to the applicable adjustments in
41 section 415 of the federal internal revenue code.
42 (B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the
43 board may modify a request by a participant to make a contribution to the

SB 64 12
1 retirement plans if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits
2 under section 415(c) or 415(n) of the federal internal revenue code subject
3 to the following:
4 (i) Where the retirement plan's law requires a lump-sum payment, for
5 the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment
6 plan in order to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under section
7 415(c) or 415(n) of the federal internal revenue code.
8 (ii) If the board's option under clause (i) will not avoid a contribution
9 in excess of the limits under section 415(c) or 415(n) of the federal internal
10 revenue code, the board shall reduce or deny the contribution.
11 (C) Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in
12 limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if an active member
13 makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit
14 under a retirement plan, then the requirements of this section shall be
15 treated as met only if:
16 (i) The requirements of section 415(b) of the federal internal revenue
17 code are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all
18 such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of such section; or
19 (ii) the requirements of section 415(c) of the federal internal revenue
20 code are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual
21 additions for purposes of such section. For purposes of applying clause (i)
22 a retirement plan shall not fail to meet the reduced limit under section
23 415(b)(2)(C) of the federal internal revenue code solely by reason of this
24 subparagraph (C), and for purposes of applying clause (ii), a retirement
25 plan shall not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)
26 (B) of the federal internal revenue code solely by reason of this paragraph.
27 (iii) For purposes of this clause, the term "permissive service credit"
28 means service credit:
29 (a) Specifically recognized by a retirement plan's law for purposes of
30 calculating a member's benefit under that retirement plan;
31 (b) that such member has not received under a retirement plan; and
32 (c) that such member may receive under a retirement plan's law only
33 by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined
34 under the retirement plan's law and procedures established by the board,
35 that does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable
36 to such service credit.
37 (iv) A retirement plan shall fail to meet the requirements of this
38 clause if the retirement plan's law specifically provides for a purchase of
39 nonqualified service purchase, and if:
40 (a) More than five years of nonqualified service credit are taken into
41 account for purposes of this subclause; or
42 (b) any nonqualified service credit is taken into account under this
43 subclause before the member has at least five years of participation under

SB 64 13
1 a retirement plan. For purposes of this subclause, effective for permissive
2 service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after
3 December 31, 1997, the term "nonqualified service credit" means the same
4 as provided in section 415(n)(3)(C) of the federal internal revenue code.
5 (v) In the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer after December 31,
6 2001, to which section 403(b)(13)(A) or 457(e)(17)(A) of the federal
7 internal revenue code applies, without regard to whether the transfer is
8 made between plans maintained by the same employer:
9 (a) The limitations of clause (iv) shall not apply in determining
10 whether the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credit; and
11 (b) the distribution rules applicable under federal law to a retirement
12 plan shall apply to such amounts and any benefits attributable to such
13 amounts.
14 (vi) For an eligible member, the limitation of section 415(c)(1) of the
15 federal internal revenue code shall not be applied to reduce the amount of
16 permissive service credit which may be purchased to an amount less than
17 the amount which was allowed to be purchased under the terms of the
18 statute as in effect on August 5, 1997. For purposes of this clause, an
19 eligible member is an individual who first became a member in the
20 retirement plan before January 1, 1998.
21 (D) Subject to approval by the internal revenue service, the board
22 shall maintain a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement under
23 section 415(m) of the federal internal revenue code. The board shall
24 establish the necessary and appropriate procedures for the administration
25 of such benefit arrangement under the federal internal revenue code. The
26 amount of any annual benefit that would exceed the limitations imposed
27 by section 415 of the federal internal revenue code shall be paid from this
28 benefit arrangement. The amount of any contribution that would exceed
29 the limitations imposed by section 415 of the federal internal revenue code
30 shall be credited to this benefit arrangement. The qualified excess benefit
31 arrangement shall be a separate portion of the retirement plan. The
32 qualified excess benefit arrangement is subject to the following
33 requirements:
34 (i) The benefit arrangement shall be maintained solely for the purpose
35 of providing to participants in the retirement plans that part of the
36 participant's annual benefit otherwise payable under the terms of the act
37 that exceeds the limitations on benefits imposed by section 415 of the
38 federal internal revenue code; and
39 (ii) participants do not have an election, directly or indirectly, to defer
40 compensation to the excess benefit arrangement.
41 (E) For purposes of applying these limits only and for no other
42 purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable shall be
43 compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year,

SB 64 14
1 except as noted below and as permitted by treasury regulation section
2 1.415(c)-2. Specifically, compensation shall be defined as wages within
3 the meaning of section 3401(a) of the federal internal revenue code and all
4 other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which
5 the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under
6 sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 of the federal internal revenue code.
7 Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules under
8 section 3401(a) of the federal internal revenue code that limit the
9 remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the
10 employment or the services performed, such as the exception for
11 agricultural labor in section 3401(a)(2) of the federal internal revenue
12 code.
13 (i) However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997,
14 compensation shall also include amounts that would otherwise be included
15 in compensation but for an election under sections 125(a), 402(e)(3),
16 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b) of the federal internal revenue code. For
17 limitation years beginning after December 30, 2000, compensation shall
18 also include any elective amounts that are not includable in the gross
19 income of the employee by reason of section 132(f)(4) of the federal
20 internal revenue code.
21 (ii) The definition of compensation shall exclude employee
22 contributions picked up under section 414(h)(2) of the federal internal
23 revenue code.
24 (iii) For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007,
25 compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid
26 by the later of two and a half months after an employee's severance from
27 employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the
28 employee's severance from employment if:
29 (a) The payment is regular compensation for services during the
30 employee's regular working hours or compensation for services outside the
31 employee's regular working hours, such as overtime or shift differential,
32 commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and absent a severance
33 from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee
34 while the employee continues in employment with the employer;
35 (b) the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or
36 other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment
37 had continued; or
38 (c) for limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2012, the
39 payment is made pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred
40 compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the
41 member at the same time if the member had continued employment with
42 the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includable in the
43 member's gross income.

SB 64 15
1 (iv) Any payments not described in clause (iii) are not considered
2 compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are
3 paid within two and a half months following severance from employment,
4 except for payments to the individual who does not currently perform
5 services for the employer by reason of qualified military service, within
6 the meaning of section 414(u)(1) of the federal internal revenue code, to
7 the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would
8 have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the
9 employer rather than entering qualified military service.
10 (v) An employee who is in qualified military service, within the
11 meaning of section 414(u)(1) of the federal internal revenue code, shall be
12 treated as receiving compensation from the employer during such period
13 of qualified military service equal to: (a) The compensation the employee
14 would have received during such period if the employee were not in
15 qualified military service, determined based on the rate of pay the
16 employee would have received from the employer but for the absence
17 during the period of qualified military service; or (b) if the compensation
18 the employee would have received during such period was not reasonably
19 certain, the employee's average compensation from the employer during
20 the 12-month period immediately preceding the qualified military service,
21 or if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding the
22 qualified military service.
23 (vi) Back pay, within the meaning of treasury regulation section
24 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to
25 which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and
26 compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition.
27 (7) On and after January 1, 2009, for purposes of applying the limits
28 under section 415(b) of the federal internal revenue code, the following
29 shall apply:
30 (A) A member's applicable limit shall be applied to the member's
31 annual benefit in the first limitation year without regard to any automatic
32 cost-of-living increases;
33 (B) to the extent the member's annual benefit equals or exceeds such
34 limit, the member shall no longer be eligible for cost-of-living increases
35 until such time as the benefit plus the accumulated increases are less than
36 such limit;
37 (C) thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, the member's annual
38 benefit including any automatic cost-of-living increase applicable shall be
39 tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to
40 the dollar limit under section 415(b)(1)(A) or 415(d) of the federal internal
41 revenue code and the regulations thereunder; and
42 (D) in no event shall a member's annual benefit payable from a
43 retirement plan in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at

SB 64 16
1 the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to
2 section 415(d) of the federal internal revenue code and the regulations
3 thereunder. If the form of benefit without regard to the automatic benefit
4 increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the preceding sentence is
5 applied by reducing the limit under section 415(b) of the federal internal
6 revenue code applicable at the annuity starting date to an actuarially
7 equivalent amount determined using the assumptions specified in treasury
8 regulation section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii) that take into account the death
9 benefits under the form of benefit. This subsection applies to distributions
10 made on and after January 1, 1993. A distributee may elect to have any
11 portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
12 retirement plan specified by the distributee in a transfer made from the
13 retirement system.
14 (i) An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any
15 portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an
16 eligible rollover distribution does not include: (a) Any distribution that is
17 one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less frequently
18 than annually, made for the life or the life expectancy of the distributee or
19 the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and the
20 distributee's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of 10 years or
21 more; (b) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under
22 section 401(a)(9) of the federal internal revenue code; (c) the portion of
23 any distribution that is not includable in gross income; and (d) any other
24 distribution that is reasonably expected to total less than $200 during the
25 year. Effective January 1, 2002, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to
26 be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of
27 after-tax employee contributions that are not includable in gross income.
28 However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement
29 account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the federal internal
30 revenue code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in
31 section 401(a) of the federal internal revenue code or to a qualified plan
32 described in section 403(a) of the federal internal revenue code, that agrees
33 to separately account for amounts so transferred and earnings on such
34 amounts, including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution
35 that is includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is
36 not so includable, or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined
37 benefit plan described in section 401(a) of the federal internal revenue
38 code or to an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the federal
39 internal revenue code, that agrees to separately account for amounts so
40 transferred and earnings thereon, including separately accounting for the
41 portion of the distribution that is includable in gross income and the
42 portion of the distribution that is not so includable.
43 (ii) An eligible retirement plan is any of the following that accepts the

SB 64 17
1 distributee's eligible rollover distribution:
2 (a) An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of
3 the federal internal revenue code;
4 (b) an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the
5 federal internal revenue code;
6 (c) an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the federal internal
7 revenue code;
8 (d) a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the federal internal
9 revenue code;
10 (e) effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section
11 403(b) of the federal internal revenue code;
12 (f) effective January 1, 2002, a plan eligible under section 457(b) of
13 the federal internal revenue code that is maintained by a state, political
14 subdivision of a state or any agency or instrumentality of a state or a
15 political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for
16 amounts transferred into the plan from a retirement plan; or
17 (g) effective January 1, 2008, a roth IRA described in section 408(A)
18 of the federal internal revenue code; or
19 (h) effective January 1, 2016, a SIMPLE IRA, as described in section
20 408(p) of the federal internal revenue code, provided that the rollover
21 contribution is made after the two-year period described in section 72(t)
22 (6) of the federal internal revenue code.
23 (iii) Effective January 1, 2002, the definition of eligible rollover
24 distribution also includes a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a
25 spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a domestic
26 relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the federal internal revenue
27 code.
28 (iv) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also
29 includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the
30 employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the
31 alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in
32 section 414(p) of the federal internal revenue code. Effective July 1, 2007,
33 a distributee further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated
34 beneficiary as defined by section 401(a)(9)(E) of the federal internal
35 revenue code. However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the
36 distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual
37 retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution
38 and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual
39 retirement account or annuity.
40 (v) A direct rollover is a payment by the retirement system to the
41 eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
42 (8) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board may accept a
43 direct or indirect eligible rollover distributions for the purpose of the

SB 64 18
1 purchase of service credit. In addition, the board may accept a direct
2 trustee to trustee transfer from a deferred compensation plan under section
3 457(b) of the federal internal revenue code or a tax sheltered annuity under
4 section 403(b) of the federal internal revenue code for: (A) The purchase
5 of permissive service credit, as defined under section 415(n)(3)(A) of the
6 federal internal revenue code; or (B) a repayment to which section 415 of
7 the federal internal revenue code does not apply pursuant to section 415(k)
8 (3) of the federal internal revenue code. Any such transfer shall be allowed
9 as provided in this subsection to the extent permitted by law, subject to any
10 conditions, proofs or acceptance established or required by the board or
11 the board's designee.
12 (9) Where required by the act, an employer shall pick up and pay
13 contributions that would otherwise be payable by members of a retirement
14 plan in accordance with section 414(h)(2) of the federal internal revenue
15 code as follows:
16 (A) The contributions, although designated as employee
17 contributions, are being paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by
18 the employee;
19 (B) the employee must not have been given the option of receiving
20 the amounts directly instead of having them paid to the retirement plan;
21 and
22 (C) the pickup shall apply to amounts that a member elects to
23 contribute to receive credit for prior or participating service if the election
24 is irrevocable and applies to amounts contributed before retirement.
25 (10) (A) Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary,
26 contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military
27 service will be provided in accordance with section 414(u) of the federal
28 internal revenue code and the uniformed services employment and
29 reemployment rights act of 1994.
30 (B) Effective with respect to deaths occurring on or after January 1,
31 2007, while a member is performing qualified military service, as defined
32 in chapter 43 of title 38, United States code, to the extent required by
33 section 401(a)(37) of the federal internal revenue code, survivors of a
34 member in the system, are entitled to any additional benefits that the
35 system would provide if the member had resumed employment and then
36 died, such as accelerated vesting or survivor benefits that are contingent on
37 the member's death while employed. A deceased member's period of
38 qualified military service must be counted for vesting purposes.
39 (C) Effective with respect to deaths or disabilities, or both, occurring
40 on or after January 1, 2007, while a member is performing qualified
41 military service, as defined in chapter 43 of title 38, United States code, to
42 the extent permitted by section 414(u)(9) of the federal internal revenue
43 code, for the benefit accrual purposes and in the case of death, for vesting

SB 64 19
1 purposes, the member will be treated as having earned years of service for
2 the period of qualified military service, having returned to employment on
3 the day before the death or disability, or both, and then having terminated
4 on the date of death or disability. This provision shall be applied to all
5 similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.
6 (D) Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section
7 414(u)(12) of the federal internal revenue code, an individual receiving
8 differential wage payments, as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the
9 federal internal revenue code, from an employer shall be treated as
10 employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be
11 treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual
12 additions under section 415(c) of the federal internal revenue code. This
13 provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a
14 reasonably equivalent manner.
15 (11) Upon the complete or partial termination of a retirement plan,
16 the rights of members to benefits accrued to the date of termination, to the
17 extent funded, or to the amounts in their accounts are nonforfeitable, and
18 amounts in their accounts may be distributed to them.
19 (d) The plan year for the retirement plan begins on July 1.
20 (e) The limitation year for purposes of section 415 of the federal
21 internal revenue code is the calendar year.
22 (f) The board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by section
23 503(b) of the federal internal revenue code.
24 (g) (1) For purposes of determining an "actuarial equivalent" or of an
25 "actuarial computation" for members hired prior to July 1, 2009, the board
26 shall use the following:
27 (A) The applicable mortality table is specified in revenue ruling
28 2001-62 or revenue ruling 2007-67, as applicable; and
29 (B) the applicable interest factor is the actuarially assumed rate of
30 return established by the board.
31 (2) For purposes of determining an "actuarial equivalent" or an
32 "actuarial computation" for members hired on or after July 1, 2009, the

34 (A) The applicable mortality table is the 50/ male/female blend of the
50
35 RP 2000 health annuitant mortality table, projected to 2025; and
36 (B) the applicable interest factor is the actuarially assumed rate of
37 return established by the board.
38 (3) For converting amounts payable under the partial lump sum
39 option, the board shall use the following:
40 (A) The applicable mortality table is a 50/ male/female blend of the
50
41 1983 group annuity mortality table; and
42 (B) the applicable interest factor is the actuarially assumed rate of
43 return established by the board.

SB 64 20
1 (4) For benefit testing under section 415(b) of the federal internal
2 revenue code, the factors required by treasury regulations shall be used.
3 The applicable mortality table is specified in revenue ruling 2001-62 for
4 years prior to January 1, 2009, and notice 2008-85 for years after
5 December 31, 2008.
