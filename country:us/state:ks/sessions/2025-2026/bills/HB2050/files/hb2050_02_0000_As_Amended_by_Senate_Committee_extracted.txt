9 duly certified copy of the order or resolution of the board of directors,
10 trustees or managers authorizing the president and secretary to execute the

31 under this subsection.
32 (3) On and after the effective date of this act, any applicant for an
33 individual insurance agent's license who previously held a license that
34 expires on or after June 30, 2001, because of failure to meet continuing
35 education requirements and who seeks to be relicensed shall provide
36 evidence that appropriate C.E.C.s have been completed for the prior
37 biennium.
38 (4) Upon receipt of a written application from an individual insurance
39 agent, the commissioner, in cases involving medical hardship or military
40 service, may extend the time within which to fulfill the minimum
41 continuing educational requirements for a period of not to exceed 180
42 days.
43 (5) This section shall not apply to any inactive insurance agent during

1 the period of such inactivity. For the purposes of this paragraph, "inactive
2 period" or "period of inactivity" means a continuous period of time of not

7 met the continuing education requirement; and
8 (B) pay the renewal fee. If the required proof of continuing education
9 completion and the renewal fee is not furnished at the end of the inactive
10 period, such individual insurance agent's qualification and each and every
11 corresponding license shall expire at the end of the period of inactivity. For
12 issuance of a new license, the individual shall apply for a license and pass
13 the required examination.
14 (6) Any individual who allows such individual's insurance agent
15 license in this state and in all other states in which where such individual is
16 licensed as an insurance agent to expire for a period of four or more
17 consecutive years, shall apply for a new insurance agent license and pass
18 the required examination.
19 (f) (1) Each course, program of study, or subject shall be submitted to
20 and certified by the commissioner in order to qualify for purposes of
21 continuing education.
22 (2) Each request for certification of any course, program of study or
23 subject shall contain the following information:

29 (E) an outline of each course, program of study or subject, including a
30 schedule of times when such material will be presented;

32 (G) the number of C.E.C.s requested;
33 (H) a nonrefundable C.E.C. qualification fee in the amount of not to

35 per year for all courses, programs of study or subjects submitted by a
36 specific provider or provider organization; and
37 (I) a nonrefundable annual provider fee of not to exceed $100.
38 (3) Upon receipt of such information, the commissioner shall grant or

41 of C.E.C.s that will be recognized for each approved course, program of
42 study or subject. Each approved course, program of study or subject shall
43 be assigned by the commissioner to one or both of the following classes:

HB 2050—Am. by SC 50
1 (A) Property and casualty; or
2 (B) life insurance, including annuity and variable contracts, and
3 accident and health insurance.
4 (4) Each course, program of study or subject shall have a value of at
5 least one C.E.C.
6 (5) (A) Each provider seeking approval of a course, program of study
7 or subject for continuing education credit shall issue or cause to be issued
8 to each person who attends a course, program of study or subject offered
9 by such provider a certificate of attendance. The certificate shall be signed
10 by either the instructor who presents the course, program of study or
11 course or such provider's authorized representative. Each provider shall
12 maintain a list of all individuals who attend courses offered by such
13 provider for continuing education credit for the remainder of the biennium
14 in which the courses are offered and the entire next succeeding biennium.
15 (B) The commissioner shall accept, without substantive review, any
16 course, program of study or subject submitted by a provider that has been
17 approved by the insurance supervisory authority of any other state or
18 territory accredited by the NAIC. The commissioner may disapprove any
19 individual instructor or provider who has been the subject of disciplinary
20 proceedings or who has otherwise failed to comply with any other state's
21 or territory's laws or regulations.
22 (6) The commissioner may grant or approve any specific course,
23 program of study or course that has appropriate merit, such as any course,
24 programs of study or course with broad national or regional recognition,
25 without receiving any request for certification. The fee prescribed by
26 subsection (f)(2) shall not apply to any approval granted pursuant to this
27 provision.
28 (7) The C.E.C. value assigned to any course, program of study or
29 subject, other than a correspondence course, computer based training,
30 interactive internet study training or other course pursued by independent
31 study, shall in no way be contingent upon passage or satisfactory
32 completion of any examination given in connection with such course,
33 program of study or subject. The commissioner shall establish, by rules
34 and regulations, the criteria for determining acceptability of any method
35 used for verification of the completion of each stage of any computer
36 based or interactive internet study training. Completion of any computer
37 based training or interactive internet study training shall be verified in
38 accordance with a method approved by the commissioner.
39 (g) Upon request, the commissioner shall provide a list of all
40 approved continuing education courses currently available to the public.
41 (h) An individual insurance agent who independently studies an
42 insurance course, program of study or subject that is not an agent's
43 examination approved by the commissioner shall receive credit for the

HB 2050—Am. by SC 51
1 C.E.C.s assigned by the commissioner as recognition for the approved
2 subject. No other credit shall be given for independent study.
3 (i) Any licensed individual insurance agent who is unable to comply
4 with license renewal procedures due to military service or some other
5 extenuating circumstances may request a waiver of those procedures from
6 the commissioner. Such agent may also request from the commissioner a
7 waiver of any examination requirement or any other fine or sanction
8 imposed for failure to comply with renewal procedures.
9 (j) Not later than December 1 of each year, the commissioner shall
10 set and cause to be published in the Kansas register the fees required
11 pursuant to this section for the next calendar year.

17 viators are residents of different states, the viatical settlement shall be

34 from year to year on the anniversary date upon payment of the annual
35 renewal fee of not to exceed $50. Failure to pay the fees by the renewal
36 date results in expiration of such license.
37 (f) The applicant shall provide information on forms required by the
38 commissioner. The commissioner shall have authority, at any time, to
39 require the applicant to fully disclose the identity of all stockholders,
40 partners, officers, members and employees, and the commissioner, in the
41 exercise of the commissioner's discretion, may refuse to issue a license in

2 (g) A license issued to a legal entity authorizes all partners, officers,

5 those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements to the
6 application.

23 applicant, unless a written designation of an agent for service of process is
24 filed and maintained with the commissioner or the applicant has filed with
25 the commissioner, the applicant's written irrevocable consent that any
26 action against the applicant may be commenced against the applicant by
27 service of process on the commissioner.
28 (j) A viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall

9 adjuster license upon the commissioner's receipt of proof that the licensee
