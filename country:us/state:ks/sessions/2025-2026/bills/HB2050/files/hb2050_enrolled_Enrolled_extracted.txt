carrier insurer would accept such risk at a different rate. The licensed
excess coverage agent must shall, prior to placing insurance with an
eligible nonadmitted insurer not authorized to do business in this state,
obtain the written consent of the prospective named insured and
provide such insured the following information in a form promulgated

insurer.
(c) In the event the insured desires that coverage be bound with an
insurer not admitted to this state eligible nonadmitted insurer and it is

the coverage, the excess lines agent may bind the coverage after
advising the insured of the information set out above and shall obtain
written confirmation that the insured desires that coverage be placed
with an insurer not admitted to this state eligible nonadmitted insurer
within 30 days after binding coverage.
(d) (1) When business comes to a licensed excess lines agent in

to being insured with an insurer not authorized to do business in this
state eligible nonadmitted insurer. Each excess lines agent shall keep a
separate record book in such agent's office showing the transactions of
fire and casualty insurance and reinsurance placed in companies not
authorized to do business in this state eligible nonadmitted insurers, the
amount of gross premiums charged thereon, the insurer with which the

and nature of the risk, the name of the insured and such other
information as the commissioner may require and such record shall be

guaranty fund.
(3) If business is placed with a nonadmitted company that is
subsequently determined to be insolvent, the excess lines agent placing
such business with such company is relieved of any responsibility to
the insured as it relates to such insolvency, if the excess lines agent has
satisfactorily complied with all requirements of this section pertaining
to notification of the insured, has properly obtained the written consent
of the insured and has used due diligence in selecting the insurer. It
shall be presumed that due diligence was used in selecting the insurer if

amendments thereto, at the time coverage first became effective.

(2) Motor vehicle liability insurance or self-insurance applicable
to the injury cannot be identified;
(3) Personal injury protection benefits applicable to the injury are
inadequate to provide the contracted-for benefits because of financial
inability of an insurer or self-insurer to fulfill its obligation; however,
except that benefits available through the assigned claims plan shall be
excess over any benefits paid or payable through the Kansas insurance
guaranty association. If the personal injury protection benefits are not
paid by the Kansas insurance guaranty association within the limitation
of time specified in this act, such benefits shall be paid by the assigned
claims plan. Payments made by the assigned claims plan pursuant to
this section shall constitute covered claims under K.S.A. 40-2901et

regulations as are necessary for its operation and for the assessment of
costs, which shall be approved by the commissioner. Any claim brought
through said plan shall be assigned to an insurer or self-insurer, in
accordance with the approved regulations of operation, and such
insurer or self-insurer, after the assignment, shall have the same rights
and obligations as it would have if, prior to such assignment, it had
issued a motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing personal
injury protection benefits applicable to the loss or expenses incurred or
was a self-insurer providing such benefits. Any party accepting benefits
hereunder under this section shall have such rights and obligations as

carrier insurer would accept such risk at a different rate. The licensed
excess coverage agent must shall, prior to placing insurance with an
eligible nonadmitted insurer not authorized to do business in this state,
obtain the written consent of the prospective named insured and
provide such insured the following information in a form promulgated

insurer.
(c) In the event the insured desires that coverage be bound with an
insurer not admitted to this state eligible nonadmitted insurer and it is

the coverage, the excess lines agent may bind the coverage after
advising the insured of the information set out above and shall obtain
written confirmation that the insured desires that coverage be placed
with an insurer not admitted to this state eligible nonadmitted insurer
within 30 days after binding coverage.
(d) (1) When business comes to a licensed excess lines agent in
which this state is the home state for placement with an insurer not

insured has been provided the preceding information and has consented
to being insured with an insurer not authorized to do business in this
state eligible nonadmitted insurer. Each excess lines agent shall keep a
separate record book in such agent's office showing the transactions of
fire and casualty insurance and reinsurance placed in companies not
authorized to do business in this state eligible nonadmitted insurers, the
amount of gross premiums charged thereon, the insurer with which the

and nature of the risk, the name of the insured and such other
information as the commissioner may require and such record shall be

guaranty fund.

such business with such company is relieved of any responsibility to
the insured as it relates to such insolvency, if the excess lines agent has
satisfactorily complied with all requirements of this section pertaining
to notification of the insured, has properly obtained the written consent
of the insured and has used due diligence in selecting the insurer. It
shall be presumed that due diligence was used in selecting the insurer if

such insurer was on the list compiled pursuant to K.S.A. 40-246e, and
amendments thereto, at the time coverage first became effective.

$15,000,000. A nonrefundable filing fee of $200 shall be required of

(2) Motor vehicle liability insurance or self-insurance applicable
to the injury cannot be identified;

inability of an insurer or self-insurer to fulfill its obligation; however,
except that benefits available through the assigned claims plan shall be
excess over any benefits paid or payable through the Kansas insurance
guaranty association. If the personal injury protection benefits are not
paid by the Kansas insurance guaranty association within the limitation

claims plan. Payments made by the assigned claims plan pursuant to
this section shall constitute covered claims under K.S.A. 40-2901et

benefits through the assigned claims plan with respect to injury which

regulations as are necessary for its operation and for the assessment of
costs, which shall be approved by the commissioner. Any claim brought
through said plan shall be assigned to an insurer or self-insurer, in
accordance with the approved regulations of operation, and such
insurer or self-insurer, after the assignment, shall have the same rights
and obligations as it would have if, prior to such assignment, it had
issued a motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing personal
injury protection benefits applicable to the loss or expenses incurred or
was a self-insurer providing such benefits. Any party accepting benefits
hereunder under this section shall have such rights and obligations as
