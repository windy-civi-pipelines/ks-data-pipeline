14 (5) (A) A licensed insurance agent who is a member of the national
15 guard or any reserve component of the armed services of the United States
16 who serves on active duty for at least 90 consecutive days shall be exempt
17 from the requirement to obtain C.E.C.s during the time that such insurance
18 agent is on active duty.
19 (B) The commissioner shall grant an extension to any licensed
20 insurance agent described in subparagraph (A) until the biennial due date
21 that occurs in the year next succeeding the year in which such active duty
22 ceases.
23 (d) An instructor of an approved subject shall be entitled to the same
24 C.E.C. as a student completing the study.
25 (e) (1) An individual insurance agent who has been licensed for more
26 than one year, on or before such insurance agent's biennial due date, shall
27 file a report with the commissioner certifying that such insurance agent has
28 met the continuing education requirements for the previous biennium
29 ending on such insurance agent's biennial due date. Each individual
30 insurance agent shall maintain a record of all courses attended together
31 with a certificate of attendance for the remainder of the biennium in which
32 the courses were attended and the entire next succeeding biennium.
33 (2) If the required report showing proof of continuing education
34 completion is not received by the commissioner by the individual
35 insurance agent's biennial due date, such individual insurance agent's
36 qualification and each and every corresponding license shall be suspended
37 automatically for a period of 90 calendar days or until such time as the
38 producer satisfactorily demonstrates completion of the continuing
39 education requirement, whichever is sooner. In addition, the commissioner
40 shall assess a penalty of $100 for each license suspended. If such insurance
41 agent fails to furnish to the commissioner the required proof of continuing
42 education completion and the monetary penalty within 90 calendar days of
43 such insurance agent's biennial due date, such individual insurance agent's

HB 2050 48
1 qualification and each and every corresponding license shall expire on
2 such insurance agent's biennial due date. If after more than three but less
3 than 12 months from the date the license expired, the insurance agent
4 wants to reinstate such insurance agent's license, such individual shall
5 provide the required proof of continuing education completion and pay a
6 reinstatement fee in the amount of $100 for each license suspended. If
7 after more than 12 months from the date an insurance agent's license has
8 expired, such insurance agent wants to reinstate such insurance agent's
9 license, such individual shall apply for an insurance agent's license,
10 provide the required proof of continuing education completion and pay a
11 reinstatement fee in the amount of $100 for each license suspended. Upon
12 receipt of a written application from such insurance agent claiming
13 extreme hardship, the commissioner may waive any penalty imposed
14 under this subsection.
15 (3) On and after the effective date of this act, any applicant for an
16 individual insurance agent's license who previously held a license that
17 expires on or after June 30, 2001, because of failure to meet continuing
18 education requirements and who seeks to be relicensed shall provide
19 evidence that appropriate C.E.C.s have been completed for the prior
20 biennium.
21 (4) Upon receipt of a written application from an individual insurance
22 agent, the commissioner, in cases involving medical hardship or military
23 service, may extend the time within which to fulfill the minimum
24 continuing educational requirements for a period of not to exceed 180
25 days.
26 (5) This section shall not apply to any inactive insurance agent during
27 the period of such inactivity. For the purposes of this paragraph, "inactive
28 period" or "period of inactivity" means a continuous period of time of not
29 more than four years starting from the date inactive status is granted by the
30 commissioner. Before returning to active status, such inactive insurance
31 agent shall:
32 (A) File a report with the commissioner certifying that such agent has
33 met the continuing education requirement; and
34 (B) pay the renewal fee. If the required proof of continuing education
35 completion and the renewal fee is not furnished at the end of the inactive
36 period, such individual insurance agent's qualification and each and every
37 corresponding license shall expire at the end of the period of inactivity. For
38 issuance of a new license, the individual shall apply for a license and pass
39 the required examination.
40 (6) Any individual who allows such individual's insurance agent
41 license in this state and in all other states in which where such individual is
42 licensed as an insurance agent to expire for a period of four or more
43 consecutive years, shall apply for a new insurance agent license and pass

HB 2050 49
1 the required examination.
2 (f) (1) Each course, program of study, or subject shall be submitted to
3 and certified by the commissioner in order to qualify for purposes of
4 continuing education.
5 (2) Each request for certification of any course, program of study or
6 subject shall contain the following information:
7 (A) The name of the provider or provider organization;
8 (B) the title of such course, program of study or subject;
9 (C) the date the course, program of study or subject will be offered;
10 (D) the location where the course, program of study or subject will be
11 offered;
12 (E) an outline of each course, program of study or subject, including
13 a schedule of times when such material will be presented;
14 (F) the names and qualifications of instructors;
15 (G) the number of C.E.C.s requested;
16 (H) a nonrefundable C.E.C. qualification fee in the amount of not to
17 exceed $50 per course, program of study or subject or not to exceed $250
18 per year for all courses, programs of study or subjects submitted by a
19 specific provider or provider organization; and
20 (I) a nonrefundable annual provider fee of not to exceed $100.
21 (3) Upon receipt of such information, the commissioner shall grant or
22 deny certification of any submitted course, program of study or subject as
23 an approved subject, program of study or course and indicate the number
24 of C.E.C.s that will be recognized for each approved course, program of
25 study or subject. Each approved course, program of study or subject shall
26 be assigned by the commissioner to one or both of the following classes:
27 (A) Property and casualty; or
28 (B) life insurance, including annuity and variable contracts, and
29 accident and health insurance.
30 (4) Each course, program of study or subject shall have a value of at
31 least one C.E.C.
32 (5) (A) Each provider seeking approval of a course, program of study
33 or subject for continuing education credit shall issue or cause to be issued
34 to each person who attends a course, program of study or subject offered
35 by such provider a certificate of attendance. The certificate shall be signed
36 by either the instructor who presents the course, program of study or
37 course or such provider's authorized representative. Each provider shall
38 maintain a list of all individuals who attend courses offered by such
39 provider for continuing education credit for the remainder of the biennium
40 in which the courses are offered and the entire next succeeding biennium.
41 (B) The commissioner shall accept, without substantive review, any
42 course, program of study or subject submitted by a provider that has been
43 approved by the insurance supervisory authority of any other state or

HB 2050 50
1 territory accredited by the NAIC. The commissioner may disapprove any
2 individual instructor or provider who has been the subject of disciplinary
3 proceedings or who has otherwise failed to comply with any other state's
4 or territory's laws or regulations.
5 (6) The commissioner may grant or approve any specific course,
6 program of study or course that has appropriate merit, such as any course,
7 programs of study or course with broad national or regional recognition,
8 without receiving any request for certification. The fee prescribed by
9 subsection (f)(2) shall not apply to any approval granted pursuant to this
10 provision.
11 (7) The C.E.C. value assigned to any course, program of study or
12 subject, other than a correspondence course, computer based training,
13 interactive internet study training or other course pursued by independent
14 study, shall in no way be contingent upon passage or satisfactory
15 completion of any examination given in connection with such course,
16 program of study or subject. The commissioner shall establish, by rules
17 and regulations, the criteria for determining acceptability of any method
18 used for verification of the completion of each stage of any computer
19 based or interactive internet study training. Completion of any computer
20 based training or interactive internet study training shall be verified in
21 accordance with a method approved by the commissioner.
22 (g) Upon request, the commissioner shall provide a list of all
23 approved continuing education courses currently available to the public.
24 (h) An individual insurance agent who independently studies an
25 insurance course, program of study or subject that is not an agent's
26 examination approved by the commissioner shall receive credit for the
27 C.E.C.s assigned by the commissioner as recognition for the approved
28 subject. No other credit shall be given for independent study.
29 (i) Any licensed individual insurance agent who is unable to comply
30 with license renewal procedures due to military service or some other
31 extenuating circumstances may request a waiver of those procedures from
32 the commissioner. Such agent may also request from the commissioner a
33 waiver of any examination requirement or any other fine or sanction
34 imposed for failure to comply with renewal procedures.
35 (j) Not later than December 1 of each year, the commissioner shall
36 set and cause to be published in the Kansas register the fees required
37 pursuant to this section for the next calendar year.
38 Sec. 25. K.S.A. 40-5003 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
39 5003. (a) No person shall operate as a viatical settlement provider or
40 viatical settlement broker without first obtaining a license from the
41 commissioner or the insurance regulatory official of the state of residence
42 of the viator. If there is more than one viator on a single policy and the
43 viators are residents of different states, the viatical settlement shall be

HB 2050 51
1 governed by the law of the state in which the viator having the largest
2 percentage ownership resides or, if the viators hold equal ownership, the
3 state of residence of one viator agreed upon in writing by all viators.
4 (b) Application for a viatical settlement provider license shall be
5 made to the commissioner by the applicant on a form prescribed by the
6 commissioner, and these applications shall be accompanied by a
7 nonrefundable fee of not to exceed $1,000.
8 (c) Licenses for viatical settlement providers may be renewed from
9 year to year on the anniversary date upon payment of the annual renewal
10 fee of not to exceed $500. Failure to pay the fees by the renewal date
11 results in expiration of the license.
12 (d) Application for a viatical settlement broker license shall be made
13 to the commissioner by the applicant on a form prescribed by the
14 commissioner. Each application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable
15 application fee of not to exceed $100.
16 (e) Licenses for a viatical settlement broker license may be renewed
17 from year to year on the anniversary date upon payment of the annual
18 renewal fee of not to exceed $50. Failure to pay the fees by the renewal
19 date results in expiration of such license.
20 (f) The applicant shall provide information on forms required by the
21 commissioner. The commissioner shall have authority, at any time, to
22 require the applicant to fully disclose the identity of all stockholders,
23 partners, officers, members and employees, and the commissioner, in the
24 exercise of the commissioner's discretion, may refuse to issue a license in
25 the name of a legal entity if not satisfied that any officer, employee,
26 stockholder, partner or member thereof who may materially influence the
27 applicant's conduct meets the standards of this act.
28 (g) A license issued to a legal entity authorizes all partners, officers,
29 members and designated employees to act as viatical settlement providers
30 or viatical settlement brokers, as applicable, under the license, and all
31 those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements to the
32 application.
33 (h) Upon the filing of an application and the payment of the license
34 fee, the commissioner shall make an investigation of each applicant and
35 issue a license if the commissioner finds that the applicant:
36 (1) If a viatical settlement provider, has provided a detailed plan of
37 operation;
38 (2) is competent and trustworthy and intends to act in good faith in
39 the capacity involved by the license applied for;
40 (3) has a good business reputation and has had experience, training or
41 education so as to be qualified in the business for which the license is
42 applied for;
43 (4) if a legal entity, provides a certificate of good standing from the

HB 2050 52
1 state of its domicile; and
2 (5) if a viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker, has
3 provided an anti-fraud plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (g) of
4 K.S.A. 40-5012(g), and amendments thereto.
5 (i) The commissioner shall not issue a license to a nonresident
6 applicant, unless a written designation of an agent for service of process is
7 filed and maintained with the commissioner or the applicant has filed with
8 the commissioner, the applicant's written irrevocable consent that any
9 action against the applicant may be commenced against the applicant by
10 service of process on the commissioner.
11 (j) A viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker shall
12 provide to the commissioner new or revised information about officers,
13 10% or more stockholders, partners, directors, members or designated
14 employees within 30 days of the change.
15 (k) Not later than December 1 of each year, the commissioner shall
16 set and cause to be published in the Kansas register the fees required
17 pursuant to this section for the next calendar year.
18 Sec. 26. K.S.A. 40-5509 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
19 5509. (a) (1) An individual who has met the requirements for licensure
20 under this act shall be issued a public adjuster license. A public adjuster
21 license shall remain in effect, unless revoked, terminated or suspended, as
22 long as the request for renewal is timely submitted and a license renewal
23 fee of not to exceed $100 is paid and any other requirements for license
24 renewal are met by the due date. The licensee shall inform the
25 commissioner by any means acceptable to the commissioner of a change
26 of address, change of legal name or change of information submitted on
27 the application within 30 days of the change.
28 (2) Not later than December 1 of each year, the commissioner shall
29 set and cause to be published in the Kansas register the fees required
30 pursuant to this subsection for the next calendar year.
31 (b) A public adjuster shall be subject to the provisions of subsection
32 (9) of K.S.A. 40-2404(9), and amendments thereto.
33 (c) A public adjuster who allows such person's license to lapse may,
34 within 12 months from the due date of the renewal, be issued a new public
35 adjuster license upon the commissioner's receipt of proof that the licensee
36 has satisfactorily completed the renewal process and the licensee's
37 payment of a reinstatement fee of $100. The new public adjuster license
38 shall be effective on the date that the commissioner receives such proof
39 and the reinstatement fee.
40 (d) A licensed public adjuster that is unable to comply with license
41 renewal procedures due to military service, a long-term medical disability
42 or some other extenuating circumstance, may request an extension of time
43 to comply with those procedures.

HB 2050 53
1 (e) The public adjuster license shall contain the licensee's name, city
2 and state of business address, personal identification number, the date of
3 issuance, the expiration date and any other information the commissioner
4 deems necessary.
5 (f) In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's duties,
6 the commissioner may contract with non-governmental entities, including
7 the NAIC, to perform any ministerial functions, including the collection of
8 fees and data related to licensing that the commissioner may deem
9 appropriate.
