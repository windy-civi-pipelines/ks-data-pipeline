7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 is hereby amended to read as
9 follows: 39-709. (a) General eligibility requirements for assistance for
10 which federal moneys are expended. Subject to the additional requirements
11 below, assistance in accordance with plans under which federal moneys
12 are expended may be granted to any needy person who:
13 (1) Has insufficient income or resources to provide a reasonable
14 subsistence compatible with decency and health. Where a husband and
15 wife or cohabiting partners are living together, the combined income or
16 resources of both shall be considered in determining the eligibility of
17 either or both for such assistance unless otherwise prohibited by law. The
18 secretary, in determining need of any applicant for or recipient of
19 assistance shall not take into account the financial responsibility of any
20 individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance unless such applicant
21 or recipient is such individual's spouse, cohabiting partner or such
22 individual's minor child or minor stepchild if the stepchild is living with
23 such individual. The secretary in determining need of an individual may
24 provide such income and resource exemptions as may be permitted by
25 federal law. For purposes of eligibility for temporary assistance for needy
26 families, for food assistance and for any other assistance provided through
27 the Kansas department for children and families under which federal
28 moneys are expended, the secretary for children and families shall
29 consider one motor vehicle owned by the applicant for assistance,
30 regardless of the value of such vehicle, as exempt personal property and
31 shall consider any equity in any boat, personal water craft, recreational
32 vehicle, recreational off-highway vehicle or all-terrain vehicle, as defined
33 by K.S.A. 8-126, and amendments thereto, or any additional motor vehicle
34 owned by the applicant for assistance to be a nonexempt resource of the
35 applicant for assistance except that any additional motor vehicle used by
36 the applicant, the applicant's spouse or the applicant's cohabiting partner

SB 264 2
1 for the primary purpose of earning income may be considered as exempt
2 personal property in the secretary's discretion; or
3 (2) is a citizen of the United States or is an alien lawfully admitted to
4 the United States and who is residing in the state of Kansas.
5 (b) Temporary assistance for needy families. Assistance may be
6 granted under this act to any dependent child, or relative, subject to the
7 general eligibility requirements as set out in subsection (a), who resides in
8 the state of Kansas or whose parent or other relative with whom the child
9 is living resides in the state of Kansas. Such assistance shall be known as
10 temporary assistance for needy families. Where the husband and wife or
11 cohabiting partners are living together, both shall register for work under
12 the program requirements for temporary assistance for needy families in
13 accordance with criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations
14 of the secretary.
15 (1) As used in this subsection, "family group" or "household" means
16 the applicant or recipient for TANF, child care subsidy or employment
17 services and all individuals living together in which there is a relationship
18 of legal responsibility or a qualifying caretaker relationship. This will
19 include a cohabiting boyfriend or girlfriend living with the person legally
20 responsible for the child. The family group shall not be eligible for TANF
21 if the family group contains at least one adult member who has received
22 TANF, including the federal TANF assistance received in any other state,
23 for 24 calendar months beginning on and after October 1, 1996, unless the
24 secretary determines a hardship exists and grants an extension allowing

21 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
22 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
23 payments received by the secretary in behalf of any person applying for,
24 receiving or having received such assistance. This limited power of
25 attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary approves the
26 application for aid and shall remain in effect until the assignment of
27 support rights has been terminated in full.
28 (e) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys or
29 state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted a
30 medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both are

33 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
34 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
35 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
36 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
37 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
38 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
39 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
40 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to
41 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
42 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
43 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.

SB 264 12
1 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
2 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint
3 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
4 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
5 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
6 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
7 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
8 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
9 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
10 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
11 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
12 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
13 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
14 of the legislature.
15 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
16 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
17 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
18 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
19 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
20 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
21 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
22 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
23 shall be considered an available resource unless:
24 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
25 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
26 (ii) the trust is funded:
27 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
28 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
29 or
30 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that
31 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
32 assistance.
33 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
34 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
35 security act.
36 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
37 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
38 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
39 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
40 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,
41 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
42 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
43 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available

SB 264 13
1 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
2 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed
3 prior to any services being provided;
4 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
5 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
6 nonlicensed individuals;
7 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
8 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
9 wage standards;
10 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
11 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
12 revenue agencies;
13 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
14 be paid after the services are rendered;
15 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
16 contract, agreement or accord; and
17 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
18 agreement or accord ceases.
19 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
20 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
21 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
22 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
23 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
24 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
25 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
26 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
27 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
28 Kansas uniform trust code.
29 (f) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
30 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-
31 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
32 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
33 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
34 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
35 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
36 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
37 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
38 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
39 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
40 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the
41 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
42 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
43 outside the state voluntarily.

SB 264 14
1 (g) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support and
2 limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased recipients. (1)
3 (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-787, and
4 amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after September
5 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare catastrophic coverage
6 act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for or receiving medical
7 assistance under a medical care plan in which federal funds are expended,
8 any accrued, present or future rights to support and any rights to payment
9 for medical care from a third party of an applicant or recipient and any
10 other family member for whom the applicant is applying shall be deemed
11 to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the state. The
12 assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date of approval
13 for such assistance without the requirement that any document be signed
14 by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving medical
15 assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
16 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact to perform the
17 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
18 or other negotiable instruments, representing payments received by the
19 secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
20 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
21 from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance and
22 shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full. The
23 assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third party
24 under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from directly
25 billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider has not
26 submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for payment.
27 Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to support
28 are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no other shall
29 be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments thereto,
30 except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be retained by
31 the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
32 Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to payment for
33 medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the secretary for
34 repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
35 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
36 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
37 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
38 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
39 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
40 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes
41 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
42 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
43 under the provisions of subsection (e) is a claim against the property or

SB 264 15
1 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
2 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,
3 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
4 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
5 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
6 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
7 individual under subsection (e) except after the death of the surviving
8 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
9 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
10 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
11 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
12 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
13 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
14 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e) is
15 a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
16 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
17 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
18 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
19 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
20 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
21 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
22 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
23 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
24 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
25 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
26 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
27 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery
28 program under this subsection.
29 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
30 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
31 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
32 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
33 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
34 the results therefrom:
35 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
36 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
37 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
38 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
39 defined by applicable law; and
40 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,
41 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
42 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
43 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance

SB 264 16
1 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
2 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had
3 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
4 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
5 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
6 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
7 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
8 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
9 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
10 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
11 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
12 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
13 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
14 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
15 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
16 the county subject to the lien.
17 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
18 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
19 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
20 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
21 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
22 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
23 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
24 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
25 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
26 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
27 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall
28 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
29 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
30 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or
31 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
32 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
33 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
34 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
35 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
36 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
37 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
38 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
39 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
40 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
41 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
42 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
43 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to

SB 264 17
1 dissolution of the lien.
2 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the
3 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
4 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
5 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
6 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
7 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
8 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
9 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
10 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
11 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
12 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
13 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
14 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
15 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
16 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
17 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
18 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
19 following events occur:
20 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
21 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
22 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
23 environment or the secretary's designee;
24 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
25 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
26 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
27 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee
28 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
29 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
30 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed
31 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
32 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
33 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
34 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
35 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
36 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
37 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
38 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
39 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
40 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's
41 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
42 designee.
43 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and

SB 264 18
1 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
2 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of
3 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
4 nullified pursuant to law.
5 (h) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children or
6 revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
7 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
8 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
9 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
10 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
11 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
12 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
13 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
14 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
15 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
16 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
17 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
18 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
19 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
20 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
21 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
22 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
23 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
24 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
25 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
26 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
27 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
28 (i) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired from
29 employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and regulations
30 of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a felony
31 conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or parole
32 imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
33 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
34 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
35 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
36 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
37 (j) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
38 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
39 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
40 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
41 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
42 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
43 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate

SB 264 19
1 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
2 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
3 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
4 (k) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance,
5 the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned, pursuant to
6 K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on behalf of the
7 state only accrued, present or future rights to support from any other
8 person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of
9 any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or
10 receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically become
11 effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid without the
12 requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or recipient. By
13 applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance, the
14 applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
15 secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
16 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
17 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
18 secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
19 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
20 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
21 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
22 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
23 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
24 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
25 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
26 (l) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash assistance
27 as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons receiving cash
28 assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash assistance shall be
29 established, subject to applicable federal law, by the secretary for children
30 and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under such program of drug
31 screening, the secretary for children and families shall order a drug
32 screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash assistance at any time
33 when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant for or recipient of
34 cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled
35 substance analog. The secretary for children and families may use any
36 information obtained by the secretary for children and families to
37 determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not
38 limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed appointments and
39 arrest or other police records, previous employment or application for
40 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug
41 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a
42 controlled substance or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening
43 records of the applicant or recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled

SB 264 20
1 substance or controlled substance analog.
2 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
3 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
4 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
5 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
6 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
7 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
8 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
9 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
10 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
11 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
12 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
13 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
14 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
15 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
16 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
17 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
18 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
19 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
20 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
21 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
22 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
23 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
24 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
25 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
26 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
27 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills
28 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
29 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
30 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third
31 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
32 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
33 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
34 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
35 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
36 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
37 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
38 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
39 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
40 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual
41 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
42 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
43 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for

SB 264 21
1 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
2 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or
3 controlled substance analog.
4 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
5 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
6 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
7 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
8 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
9 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
10 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
11 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
12 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
13 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
14 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
15 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
16 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
17 controlled substance analog.
18 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
19 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
20 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
21 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
22 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
23 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
24 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
25 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
26 of such additional drug screening.
27 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
28 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
29 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
30 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for
31 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
32 or legal guardian's minor child.
33 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
34 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
35 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
36 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog,
37 and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall
38 thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance under this
39 subsection unless such conviction is the person's first conviction. First-
40 time offenders convicted under federal or state law of any offense that is
41 classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has as an element
42 of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution, possession or
43 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and the date

SB 264 22
1 of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall become
2 ineligible to receive cash assistance for five years from the date of
3 conviction.
4 (6) Except for hearings before the Kansas department for children
5 and families, the results of any drug screening administered as part of the
6 drug screening program authorized by this subsection shall be confidential
7 and shall not be disclosed publicly.
8 (7) The secretary for children and families may adopt such rules and
9 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
10 (8) Any authority granted to the secretary for children and families
11 under this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed
12 by law.

14 (A) "Cash assistance" means cash assistance provided to individuals
15 under the provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes
16 Annotated, and amendments thereto, and any rules and regulations adopted
