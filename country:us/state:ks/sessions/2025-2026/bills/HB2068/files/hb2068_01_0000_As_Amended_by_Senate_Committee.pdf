23 who meet uniform requirements for multistate licensure;
24 (2) enhance the abilities of member states to protect public health and
25 safety and prevent fraud and unlicensed activity within the profession;

27 licensure and regulation of the practice of cosmetology;

41 MEMBER STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES
42 (a) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the
43 commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict or in any way reduce the

HB 2068—Am. by SC 7
1 ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, rules or regulations
2 related to the practice of cosmetology in that state where those laws, rules
3 or regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
4 (b) Insofar as practicable, a member state's state licensing authority
5 shall cooperate with the commission and with each entity exercising
6 independent regulatory authority over the practice of cosmetology
7 according to the provisions of this compact.
8 (c) Discipline shall be the sole responsibility of the state where
9 cosmetology services are provided. Accordingly, each member state's state
10 licensing authority shall be responsible for receiving complaints about
11 individuals practicing cosmetology in that state and for communicating all
12 relevant investigative information about any such adverse action to the
13 other member states through the data system in addition to any other
14 methods the commission may require by rule.

16 (a) A licensee's home state shall have exclusive power to impose an
17 adverse action against a licensee's multistate license issued by the home
18 state.
19 (b) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license
20 based on the investigative information, current significant investigative
21 information or adverse action of a remote state.
22 (c) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote
23 state's state licensing authority shall have the power to:
24 (1) Take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to practice
25 cosmetology through the multistate license in that member state, except
26 that:
27 (A) Only the licensee's home state shall have the power to take
28 adverse action against the multistate license issued by the home state; and
29 (B) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's state
30 licensing authority shall give the same priority and effect to reported
31 conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had
32 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its
33 own state laws to determine the appropriate action;
34 (2) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a
35 licensee's authorization to practice within that member state;
36 (3) complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes

38 The state licensing authority shall also be empowered to report the results
39 of such an investigation to the commission through the data system as

41 (4) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
42 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of
43 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority in a member

HB 2068—Am. by SC 8
1 state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of
2 evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by
3 any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and
4 procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
5 before it. The issuing state licensing authority shall pay any witness fees,
6 travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of
7 the state where the witnesses or evidence are located;
8 (5) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected
9 licensee the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from
10 any adverse action taken against that licensee; and
11 (6) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice
12 in that state based on the factual findings of another remote state.
13 (d) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending investigation
14 of a cosmetologist who changes such licensee's primary state of residence
15 during the course of the investigation. The home state shall also have the
16 authority to take appropriate action and promptly report the conclusions of
17 the investigations to the data system.
18 (e) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's
19 multistate license, the licensee's authorization to practice in all other
20 member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been
21 removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders
22 that impose an adverse action against a licensee's multistate license shall
23 include a statement that the cosmetologist's authorization to practice is
24 deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
25 (f) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's authority
26 to accept a licensee's participation in an alternative program in lieu of
27 adverse action. A licensee's multistate license shall be suspended for the

35 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation
36 initiated under the compact.
37 ARTICLE 8—ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES
38 Active military members or their spouses shall designate a home state
39 where the individual has a current license to practice cosmetology in good
40 standing. The individual may retain their home state designation during
41 any period of service when that individual or their spouse is on active duty
42 assignment.

12 responsibilities, except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
13 protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury

19 director, employee and representative of the commission in any civil action
20 seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or

42 abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state action affirmative

1 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 17-27 or any other state or federal

5 ARTICLE 11—RULEMAKING
6 (a) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
7 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
8 provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or
9 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid
10 because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner
11 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, the powers granted
12 under this compact or based upon another applicable standard of review.
13 (b) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
14 member state, except that where the rules of the commission conflict with
15 the laws of the member state that establish the member state's scope of
16 practice laws governing the practice of cosmetology as held by a court of
17 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in
18 such state to the extent of the conflict.
19 (c) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
20 the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules
21 shall become binding as of the date specified by the commission for each

24 or a portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
25 manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption
26 of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any
27 member state or to any state applying to participate in the compact.
28 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
29 commission.
30 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a

34 least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold
35 a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a
36 notice of proposed rulemaking:
37 (1) On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible
38 platform;
39 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices
40 of proposed rulemaking; and
41 (3) in such other way as the commission may by rule specify.
42 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
43 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the

HB 2068—Am. by SC 17
1 commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if
2 different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the commission
3 will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
4 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference or
5 other electronic means, the commission shall include the mechanism for
6 access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
7 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;

13 written comments and documents received by the commission in response
14 to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
15 (j) Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring a separate
16 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
17 commission at hearings required by this article.
18 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final
19 action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full
20 text of the rule.
21 (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
22 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
23 (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
24 substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for
25 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
26 (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
27 the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in article 11(l), the effective
28 date of the rule shall not be earlier than 45 days after the commission
29 issues notice that it has adopted or amended such rule.
30 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission
31 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with five days' notice, with
32 opportunity to comment, except the usual rulemaking procedures provided
33 in the compact and this article shall be retroactively applied to the rule as
34 soon as reasonably possible, not later than 90 days after the effective date
35 of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one
36 that shall be adopted immediately to:
37 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
38 (2) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
39 (3) meet a deadline for the adoption of a rule that is established by
40 federal law or rule; or

HB 2068—Am. by SC 18
1 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency or
2 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
3 website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by
4 any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
5 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to
6 a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
7 commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made,
8 the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is
9 challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the
10 commission.
11 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
12 compact.
13 ARTICLE 12—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
14 ENFORCEMENT
15 (a) Oversight.
16 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
17 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
18 appropriate to implement the compact.
19 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
20 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
21 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
22 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
23 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
24 resolution proceedings. Nothing in this compact shall affect or limit the
25 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
26 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
27 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
28 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
29 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.

31 judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or adopted
32 rules.
33 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
34 (1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
35 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or
36 adopted rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the
37 defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the
38 proposed means of curing the default, any other action that the
39 commission may take and offer training and specific technical assistance
40 regarding the default.
41 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
42 the other member states.
43 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state

HB 2068—Am. by SC 19
1 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
2 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
3 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
4 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
5 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
6 default.
7 (4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
8 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
9 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
10 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
11 legislature, the defaulting state's state licensing authority and each of the
12 member states' state licensing authority.
13 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
14 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
15 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
16 termination.
17 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact,
18 such state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees who hold a

21 compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of
22 termination.

25 agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
26 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by
27 petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
28 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
29 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
30 reasonable attorney fees.
31 (c) Dispute resolution.
32 (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to
33 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
34 between member and non-member states.
35 (2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation
36 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
37 (d) Enforcement.
38 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
39 enforce the provisions of this compact and the commission's rules.
40 (2) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission
41 may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United
42 States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
43 where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with

HB 2068—Am. by SC 20
1 the provisions of the compact and its adopted rules. The relief sought may
2 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial
3 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
4 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies in this
5 compact shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
6 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
7 defaulting member state's law.
8 (3) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission
9 in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
10 federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
11 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its adopted rules. The
12 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
13 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
14 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
15 (4) No individual or entity other than a member state may enforce this
16 compact against the commission.
17 ARTICLE 13—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
18 AMENDMENT
19 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
20 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. On or after the
21 effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review
22 the enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the
23 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different
24 than the model compact statute.
25 (1) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially
26 different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default
27 process set forth in article 12.
28 (2) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated
29 or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence,
30 and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member
31 states should be fewer than seven.
32 (3) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
33 member states shall be subject to the process set forth in article 9(c)(24) to
34 determine if such enactments are materially different from the model
35 compact statute and whether the enactments qualify for participation in the
36 compact.
37 (4) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
38 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
39 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence
40 shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically

42 (5) Any state that joins the compact shall be subject to the
43 commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact

HB 2068—Am. by SC 21
1 becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by
2 the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the date that
3 the compact becomes law in that state.
4 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
5 statute repealing that state's enactment of the compact.
6 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
7 after enactment of the repealing statute.
8 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
9 withdrawing state's state licensing authority to comply with the
10 investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact
11 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
12 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
13 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
14 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
15 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
16 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
17 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
18 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
19 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
20 between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict
21 with the provisions of this compact.
22 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
23 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
24 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
25 ARTICLE 14—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
26 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be
27 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation
28 and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
29 authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall not be construed to
30 limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
31 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
32 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
33 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
34 state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the United States or
35 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
36 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
37 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
38 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
39 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
40 (c) Notwithstanding article 14(b), the commission may deny a state's
41 participation in the compact or terminate a member state's participation in
42 the compact, in accordance with the requirements of article 12, if the
43 commission determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state

HB 2068—Am. by SC 22
1 is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall
2 be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
3 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
4 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
5 matters.
6 ARTICLE 15—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
7 OTHER STATE LAWS
8 (a) Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement
9 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
10 compact.
11 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations or other legal requirements in a
12 member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of
13 the conflict.
14 (c) All permissible agreements between the commission and the
15 member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
16 Sec. 2.
17 SECTION 1—PURPOSE
18 In order to strengthen access to medical services and in recognition
19 of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating
20 states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
21 develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing
22 authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and
23 seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while
24 safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows medical services
25 to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the licensee's
26 qualifying license by other compact-participating states. This compact
27 also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the
28 practice and delivery of medical services by the PA occurs where the
29 patient is located at the time of the patient encounter and, therefore,
30 requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the state licensing board
31 where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in
32 this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a
33 compact privilege in that state issued to a PA through the procedures of
34 this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate burdens for
35 military families by allowing active duty military personnel and their
36 spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an unrestricted
37 license in good standing from a participating state.

38 citizens; and

HB 2068—Am. by SC 27
1 enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction,

5 fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or
6 evidence is located.
7 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), subpoenas shall not be
8 issued by a participating state to gather evidence of conduct in another
9 state that is lawful in such other state for the purpose of taking adverse
10 action against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a
11 compact privilege in the participating state.
12 (d) Nothing in this compact shall be deemed to authorize a
13 participating state to impose discipline against a PA's compact privilege

16 (e) For purposes of taking adverse action, the participating state
17 that issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect
18 to reported conduct received from any other participating state as it
19 would if the conduct had occurred within the participating state that
20 issued the qualifying license. The participating state shall apply its own
21 state laws to determine appropriate action.
22 (f) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may
23 recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition
24 of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.

39 state license. All disciplinary orders by the participating state that issued
40 the qualifying license that impose adverse action against a PA's license
41 shall include a statement that the PA's compact privilege is deactivated
42 in all participating states during the pendency of the order.

9 (6) Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or
10 jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional

16 pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when certified by
17 the commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated
18 business records of the commission and shall be entitled to any
19 associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or
20 administrative proceedings in a participating state.
21 SECTION 9—RULEMAKING
22 (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant
23 to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.
24 Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
25 commission for each rule.
26 (b) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
27 effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and
28 achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and have no
29 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
30 rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking
31 authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
32 compact, the powers granted hereunder or based upon another
33 applicable standard of review.
34 (c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
35 participating state, except that where the rules of the commission
36 conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical
37 services, a PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court
38 of competent jurisdiction, and the rules of the commission shall be
39 ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
40 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects
41 a commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
42 manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date of
43 adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and

HB 2068—Am. by SC 36
1 effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in
2 the compact.
3 (e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special
4 meeting of the commission.
5 (f) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule by the
6 commission and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the
7 rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a
8 notice of proposed rulemaking:
9 (1) On the commission's website or other publicly accessible
10 platform;
11 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's
12 notices of proposed rulemaking; and
13 (3) in such other ways as the commission may specify by rule.
14 (g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
15 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing on the
16 proposed rule and the proposed time, date and location of the meeting in
17 which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
18 (2) the text of and the reason for the proposed rule;
19 (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any
20 interested person and the date by which written comments must be
21 received; and
22 (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to
23 the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or provide
24 any written comments.
25 (h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow
26 persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which
27 shall be made available to the public.
28 (i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission
29 shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.
30 (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed
31 in the notice of proposed rulemaking published not less than five
32 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the
33 commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
34 (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner that provides each
35 person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to
36 comment orally or in writing.
37 (3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the
38 written comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments received in
39 response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person
40 upon request.
41 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
42 separate hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped
43 for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this

HB 2068—Am. by SC 37
1 section.
2 (j) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all
3 written and oral comments timely received.
4 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take
5 final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date
6 of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text
7 of the rule.
8 (1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission's website.
9 (2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
10 changes do not expand the original purpose of the proposed rule.
11 (3) The commission shall provide an explanation on its website of
12 the reasons for any substantive changes made to the proposed rule as
13 well as reasons for any substantive changes not made that were
14 recommended by commenters.
15 (4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
16 the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the
17 effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after the
18 commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
19 (l) Upon the determination that an emergency exists, the
20 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
21 prior notice, without the opportunity for comment or hearing, expect
22 that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in
23 this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
24 reasonably possible but in no event later than 90 days after the effective
25 date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is
26 one that shall be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:
27 (1) Address an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
28 (2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
29 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that
30 is established by federal law or rule; or
31 (4) protect public health and safety.
32 (m) The commission, or an authorized committee of the
33 commission, may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission
34 rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
35 errors in consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
36 revisions shall be posted on the commission's website. The revision shall
37 be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after
38 posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
39 revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made
40 as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the commission
41 prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
42 revision shall take effect without further action. If the revision is
43 challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the approval of the

HB 2068—Am. by SC 38
1 commission.
2 (n) No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply
3 under this compact.
4 SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION
5 AND ENFORCEMENT
6 (a) Oversight.
7 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
8 participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions
9 necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
10 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
11 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
12 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
13 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
14 the extent that it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
15 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection
16 or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
17 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
18 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
19 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
20 compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene
21 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission
22 with service of process shall render a judgment or order in such
23 proceeding void as to the commission, this compact or commission rules.
24 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
25 (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has
26 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
27 this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide
28 written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
29 notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
30 default and any other action that the commission may take and shall
31 offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the
32 default.
33 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
34 may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a
35 majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
36 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be
37 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
38 shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred
39 during the period of default.
40 (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed
41 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
42 Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
43 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the

HB 2068—Am. by SC 39
1 defaulting state's legislature and to the licensing board of each of the
2 participating states.
3 (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
4 assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
5 date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
6 effective date of termination.
7 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
8 found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact,
9 unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
10 defaulting state.
11 (6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the
12 compact by the commission by petitioning the United States district court
13 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission
14 has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all
15 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
16 (7) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact,
17 the state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that
18 state of such termination:
19 (A) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that
20 state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the
21 effective date of such termination; and
22 (B) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted
23 a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact
24 privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in
25 a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating
26 state before the 180-day period ends, in which case, the compact
27 privilege shall continue.
28 (c) Dispute resolution.
29 (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall
30 attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among
31 participating states and between participating and nonparticipating
32 states.
33 (2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation
34 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
35 (d) Enforcement.
36 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
37 shall enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the commission.
38 (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure
39 compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may
40 initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of
41 Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
42 offices against a participating state in default to enforce compliance with
43 the provisions of this compact and the commission's adopted rules and

HB 2068—Am. by SC 40
1 bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
2 damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the
3 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
4 reasonable attorney fees.
5 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
6 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
7 under federal or state law.
8 (e) Legal action against the commission.
9 (1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the
10 commission in the United States district court for the District of
11 Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
12 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
13 rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
14 In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
15 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
16 attorney fees.
17 (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this
18 compact against the commission.
19 SECTION 11—DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA
20 LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
21 (a) This compact shall come into effect on the date that this
22 compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
23 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission
24 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that
25 enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, called charter-
26 participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such
27 charter-participating state is materially different than the model
28 compact.
29 (A) A charter-participating state whose enactment is found to be
30 materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the
31 default process set forth in section 10(b).
32 (B) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or
33 its participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence
34 and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
35 participating states should be fewer than seven. Participating states
36 enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be
37 subject to the process set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their
38 enactments are materially different from the model compact and
39 whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
40 (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the
41 seven initial charter-participating states shall be subject to the process
42 set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are
43 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify

HB 2068—Am. by SC 41
1 for participation in the compact.
2 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
3 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
4 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
5 existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless
6 specifically repudiated by the commission.
7 (b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the
8 commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that this
9 compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously
10 adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on
11 the day that this compact becomes law in that state.
12 (c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by
13 enacting a statute repealing the same.
14 (1) A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
15 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During the 180-day period,
16 all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and
17 were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain
18 in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also
19 licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another
20 participating state within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges
21 in other participating states shall not be affected by the passage of the
22 180 days.
23 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
24 state licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the
25 investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact
26 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
27 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this
28 compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
29 to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue
30 to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
31 minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
32 (d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
33 invalidate or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative
34 arrangement between participating states and between a participating
35 state and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions
36 of this compact.
37 (e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No
38 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
39 participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into
40 the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
41 SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
42 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall
43 be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the

HB 2068—Am. by SC 42
1 implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
2 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall
3 not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely
4 for those purposes.
5 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any
6 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
7 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
8 participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
9 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
10 person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
11 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and
12 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
13 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
14 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or subsection
15 (b), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or,
16 in accordance with the requirements of section 10(b), terminate a
17 participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
18 constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with
19 respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material
20 departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to
21 be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
22 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating
23 states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as
24 to all severable matters.
25 SECTION 13—BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
26 (a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
27 participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
28 (b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact
29 are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
30 (c) All agreements between the commission and the participating
31 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
32 Sec. 2. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
33 publication in the statute book.
