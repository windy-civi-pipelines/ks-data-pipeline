42 commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict or in any way reduce the
43 ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, rules or regulations

HB 2068 7

2 or regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
3 (b) Insofar as practicable, a member state's state licensing authority
4 shall cooperate with the commission and with each entity exercising
5 independent regulatory authority over the practice of cosmetology
6 according to the provisions of this compact.
7 (c) Discipline shall be the sole responsibility of the state where
8 cosmetology services are provided. Accordingly, each member state's state
9 licensing authority shall be responsible for receiving complaints about
10 individuals practicing cosmetology in that state and for communicating all
11 relevant investigative information about any such adverse action to the
12 other member states through the data system in addition to any other
13 methods the commission may require by rule.

16 adverse action against a licensee's multistate license issued by the home
17 state.
18 (b) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license
19 based on the investigative information, current significant investigative
20 information or adverse action of a remote state.
21 (c) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote
22 state's state licensing authority shall have the power to:
23 (1) Take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to practice
24 cosmetology through the multistate license in that member state, except
25 that:
26 (A) Only the licensee's home state shall have the power to take
27 adverse action against the multistate license issued by the home state; and
28 (B) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's state
29 licensing authority shall give the same priority and effect to reported
30 conduct received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had
31 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its
32 own state laws to determine the appropriate action;
33 (2) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a
34 licensee's authorization to practice within that member state;
35 (3) complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes

40 (4) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
41 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of

43 state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of

HB 2068 8

2 any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and
3 procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
4 before it. The issuing state licensing authority shall pay any witness fees,
5 travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of
6 the state where the witnesses or evidence are located;
7 (5) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected
8 licensee the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from
9 any adverse action taken against that licensee; and
10 (6) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice
11 in that state based on the factual findings of another remote state.
12 (d) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending investigation
13 of a cosmetologist who changes such licensee's primary state of residence
14 during the course of the investigation. The home state shall also have the
15 authority to take appropriate action and promptly report the conclusions of
16 the investigations to the data system.
17 (e) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's
18 multistate license, the licensee's authorization to practice in all other
19 member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been
20 removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders
21 that impose an adverse action against a licensee's multistate license shall
22 include a statement that the cosmetologist's authorization to practice is
23 deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
24 (f) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's authority
25 to accept a licensee's participation in an alternative program in lieu of
26 adverse action. A licensee's multistate license shall be suspended for the
27 duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.

34 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation
35 initiated under the compact.

38 where the individual has a current license to practice cosmetology in good
39 standing. The individual may retain their home state designation during
40 any period of service when that individual or their spouse is on active duty
41 assignment.

13 (5) The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe
14 all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate
15 summary of actions taken and the reasons therefore, including a
16 description of the views expressed. All documents considered in

32 sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each year for which
33 revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate annual assessment
34 amount for member states shall be allocated based upon a formula that the
35 commission shall adopt by rule.
36 (4) The commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to

9 arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or
10 that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
11 believing occurred, within the scope of commission employment, duties or
12 responsibilities, except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
13 protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury
14 or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of
15 that person. The procurement of insurance of any type by the commission
16 shall not in any way compromise or limit such immunity granted in this
17 paragraph.
18 (2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive
19 director, employee and representative of the commission in any civil action
20 seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or
21 omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment,
22 duties or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the
23 person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
24 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
25 responsibilities, except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
26 prohibit such person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense
27 and that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from
28 such person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
29 (3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member,
30 officer, executive director, employee and representative of the commission
31 for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person

33 within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or
34 that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
35 scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities, if the actual
36 or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or
37 willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
38 (4) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on the
39 liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which
40 shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
41 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
42 abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state action affirmative
43 defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman antitrust act of

HB 2068 15
1 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 17-27 or any other state or federal

5 ARTICLE 11—RULEMAKING
6 (a) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
7 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
8 provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or
9 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid
10 because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner
11 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, the powers granted
12 under this compact or based upon another applicable standard of review.
13 (b) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
14 member state, except that where the rules of the commission conflict with
15 the laws of the member state that establish the member state's scope of
16 practice laws governing the practice of cosmetology as held by a court of
17 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in
18 such state to the extent of the conflict.
19 (c) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
20 the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules
21 shall become binding as of the date specified by the commission for each
22 rule.
23 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
24 or a portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
25 manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption
26 of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any
27 member state or to any state applying to participate in the compact.
28 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
29 commission.
30 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a
31 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments,
32 data, facts, opinions and arguments.
33 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission and at
34 least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold
35 a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a
36 notice of proposed rulemaking:
37 (1) On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible
38 platform;
39 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices
40 of proposed rulemaking; and
41 (3) in such other way as the commission may by rule specify.
42 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
43 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the

HB 2068 17
1 commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if
2 different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the commission
3 will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
4 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference or
5 other electronic means, the commission shall include the mechanism for
6 access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
7 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
8 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
9 person; and
10 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written
11 comments.
12 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
13 written comments and documents received by the commission in response
14 to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
15 (j) Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring a separate
16 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
17 commission at hearings required by this article.
18 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final
19 action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full
20 text of the rule.
21 (1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
22 changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
23 (2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for
24 substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for
25 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
26 (3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
27 the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in article 11(l), the effective
28 date of the rule shall not be earlier than 45 days after the commission
29 issues notice that it has adopted or amended such rule.
30 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission
31 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with five days' notice, with
32 opportunity to comment, except the usual rulemaking procedures provided
33 in the compact and this article shall be retroactively applied to the rule as
34 soon as reasonably possible, not later than 90 days after the effective date
35 of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one
36 that shall be adopted immediately to:
37 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
38 (2) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
39 (3) meet a deadline for the adoption of a rule that is established by
40 federal law or rule; or
41 (4) protect public health and safety.
42 (m) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission
43 may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of

HB 2068 18
1 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency or
2 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
3 website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by
4 any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
5 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to
6 a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
7 commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made,
8 the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is
9 challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the
10 commission.
11 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
12 compact.
13 ARTICLE 12—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
14 ENFORCEMENT
15 (a) Oversight.
16 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
17 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
18 appropriate to implement the compact.
19 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
20 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
21 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
22 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
23 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
24 resolution proceedings. Nothing in this compact shall affect or limit the
25 selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
26 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
27 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
28 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
29 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.
30 Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a
31 judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or adopted
32 rules.
33 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
34 (1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
35 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or
36 adopted rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the
37 defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the
38 proposed means of curing the default, any other action that the
39 commission may take and offer training and specific technical assistance
40 regarding the default.
41 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
42 the other member states.
43 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state

HB 2068 19
1 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
2 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
3 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
4 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
5 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
6 default.
7 (4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
8 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
9 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
10 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
11 legislature, the defaulting state's state licensing authority and each of the
12 member states' state licensing authority.
13 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
14 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
15 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
16 termination.
17 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact,
18 such state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees who hold a
19 multistate license within that state of such termination. The terminated
20 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this
21 compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of
22 termination.
23 (7) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
24 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact unless
25 agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
26 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by
27 petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
28 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
29 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
30 reasonable attorney fees.
31 (c) Dispute resolution.
32 (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to
33 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
34 between member and non-member states.
35 (2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation
36 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
37 (d) Enforcement.
38 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
39 enforce the provisions of this compact and the commission's rules.
40 (2) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission
41 may initiate legal action against a member state in default in the United
42 States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
43 where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with

HB 2068 20
1 the provisions of the compact and its adopted rules. The relief sought may
2 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial
3 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
4 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies in this
5 compact shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
6 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
7 defaulting member state's law.
8 (3) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission
9 in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
10 federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
11 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its adopted rules. The
12 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
13 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
14 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
15 (4) No individual or entity other than a member state may enforce this
16 compact against the commission.
17 ARTICLE 13—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
18 AMENDMENT
19 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
20 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. On or after the
21 effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review
22 the enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the
23 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different
24 than the model compact statute.
25 (1) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially
26 different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default
27 process set forth in article 12.
28 (2) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated
29 or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence,
30 and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member
31 states should be fewer than seven.
32 (3) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
33 member states shall be subject to the process set forth in article 9(c)(24) to
34 determine if such enactments are materially different from the model
35 compact statute and whether the enactments qualify for participation in the
36 compact.
37 (4) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
38 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
39 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence
40 shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
41 repudiated by the commission.
42 (5) Any state that joins the compact shall be subject to the
43 commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact

HB 2068 21
1 becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by
2 the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the date that
3 the compact becomes law in that state.
4 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
5 statute repealing that state's enactment of the compact.
6 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
7 after enactment of the repealing statute.
8 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
9 withdrawing state's state licensing authority to comply with the
10 investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact
11 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
12 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
13 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
14 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
15 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
16 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
17 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
18 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
19 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
20 between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict
21 with the provisions of this compact.
22 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
23 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
24 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
25 ARTICLE 14—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
26 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be
27 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation
28 and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
29 authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall not be construed to
30 limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
31 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
32 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
33 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
34 state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the United States or
35 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
36 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
37 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
38 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
39 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
40 (c) Notwithstanding article 14(b), the commission may deny a state's
41 participation in the compact or terminate a member state's participation in
42 the compact, in accordance with the requirements of article 12, if the
43 commission determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state

HB 2068 22
1 is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall
2 be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
3 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
4 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
5 matters.
6 ARTICLE 15—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
7 OTHER STATE LAWS
8 (a) Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement
9 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
10 compact.
11 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations or other legal requirements in a
12 member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of
13 the conflict.
14 (c) All permissible agreements between the commission and the
15 member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
16 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
17 publication in the statute book.
