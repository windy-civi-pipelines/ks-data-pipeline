7 Section 1. K.S.A. 22-2802 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
8 2802. (1)(a) Any person charged with a crime shall, at the person's first
9 appearance before a magistrate, be ordered released pending preliminary
10 examination or trial upon the execution of an appearance bond in an
11 amount specified by the magistrate and sufficient to assure the appearance
12 of such person before the magistrate when ordered and to assure the public
13 safety. If the person is being bound over for a felony, the bond shall also be
14 conditioned on the person's appearance in the district court or by way of a
15 two-way electronic audio-video communication as provided in subsection
16 (14) (n) at the time required by the court to answer the charge against such
17 person and at any time thereafter that the court requires. Unless the
18 magistrate makes a specific finding otherwise, if the person is being
19 bonded out for a person felony or a person misdemeanor, the bond shall be
20 conditioned on the person being prohibited from having any contact with
21 the alleged victim of such offense for a period of at least 72 hours. The
22 magistrate may impose such of the following additional conditions of
23 release as will reasonably assure the appearance of the person for
24 preliminary examination or trial:
25 (a)(1) Place the person in the custody of a designated person or
26 organization agreeing to supervise such person;
27 (b)(2) place restrictions on the travel, association or place of abode of
28 the person during the period of release;
29 (c)(3) impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary to
30 assure appearance as required, including a condition requiring that the
31 person return to custody during specified hours;
32 (d)(4) place the person under a house arrest program pursuant to
33 K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto; or
34 (e)(5) place the person under the supervision of a court services
35 officer responsible for monitoring the person's compliance with any
36 conditions of release ordered by the magistrate. The magistrate may order
SB 180 2
1 the person to pay for any costs associated with the supervision provided by
2 the court services department in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of
3 such supervision. The magistrate may also order the person to pay for all
4 other costs associated with the supervision and conditions for compliance
5 in addition to the $15 per week.
6 (2)(b) In addition to any conditions of release provided in subsection
7 (1) (a), for any person charged with a felony, the magistrate may order
8 such person to submit to a drug and alcohol abuse examination and
9 evaluation in a public or private treatment facility or state institution and,
10 if determined by the head of such facility or institution that such person is
11 a drug or alcohol abuser or is incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, to submit
12 to treatment for such drug or alcohol abuse, as a condition of release.
13 (3)(c) The appearance bond shall be executed with sufficient solvent
14 sureties who are residents of the state of Kansas, unless the magistrate
15 determines, in the exercise of such magistrate's discretion, that requiring
16 sureties is not necessary to assure the appearance of the person at the time
17 ordered.
18 (4)(d) A deposit of cash in the amount of the bond may be made in
19 lieu of the execution of the bond pursuant to subsection (3) (c). Except as
20 provided in subsection (5)(e), such deposit shall be in the full amount of
21 the bond and in no event shall a deposit of cash in less than the full amount
22 of bond be permitted. Any person charged with a crime who is released on
23 a cash bond shall be entitled to a refund of all moneys paid for the cash
24 bond, after deduction of any outstanding restitution, costs, fines and fees,
25 after the final disposition of the criminal case if the person complies with
26 all requirements to appear in court. The court may not exclude the option
27 of posting bond pursuant to subsection (3) (c).
28 (5)(e) Except as provided further, the amount of the appearance bond
29 shall be the same whether executed as described in subsection (3) (c) or
30 posted with a deposit of cash as described in subsection (4) (d). When the
31 appearance bond has been set at $2,500 or less and the most serious charge
32 against the person is a misdemeanor, a severity level 8, 9 or 10 nonperson
33 felony, a drug severity level 4 felony committed prior to July 1, 2012, a
34 drug severity level 5 felony committed on or after July 1, 2012, or a
35 violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and amendments thereto, the magistrate may
36 allow the person to deposit cash with the clerk in the amount of 10% of the
37 bond, provided the person meets at least the following qualifications:
38 (A)(1) Is a resident of the state of Kansas;
39 (B)(2) has a criminal history score category of G, H or I;
40 (C)(3) has no prior history of failure to appear for any court

SB 180 3
1 to, another state; and

3 (6)(f) In the discretion of the court, a person charged with a crime
4 may be released upon the person's own recognizance by guaranteeing
5 payment of the amount of the bond for the person's failure to comply with
6 all requirements to appear in court. The release of a person charged with a
7 crime upon the person's own recognizance shall not require the deposit of
8 any cash by the person.
9 (7)(g) The court shall not impose any administrative fee.
10 (8)(h) In determining which conditions of release will reasonably
11 assure appearance and the public safety, the magistrate shall, on the basis
12 of available information, take into account the nature and circumstances of
13 the crime charged; the weight of the evidence against the defendant;
14 whether the defendant is lawfully present in the United States; the
15 defendant's family ties, employment, financial resources, character, mental
16 condition, length of residence in the community, record of convictions,
17 record of appearance or failure to appear at court proceedings or of flight
18 to avoid prosecution; the likelihood or propensity of the defendant to
19 commit crimes while on release, including whether the defendant will be
20 likely to threaten, harass or cause injury to the victim of the crime or any
21 witnesses thereto; and whether the defendant is on probation or parole
22 from a previous offense at the time of the alleged commission of the
23 subsequent offense.
24 (9)(i) The appearance bond shall set forth all of the conditions of
25 release.
26 (10)(j) A person for whom conditions of release are imposed and who
27 continues to be detained as a result of the person's inability to meet the
28 conditions of release shall be entitled, upon application, to have the
29 conditions reviewed without unnecessary delay by the magistrate who
30 imposed them. If the magistrate who imposed conditions of release is not
31 available, any other magistrate in the county may review such conditions.
32 (11)(k) A magistrate ordering the release of a person on any
33 conditions specified in this section may at any time amend the order to
34 impose additional or different conditions of release. If the imposition of
35 additional or different conditions results in the detention of the person, the
36 provisions of subsection (10) (j) shall apply.
37 (12)(l) Statements or information offered in determining the
38 conditions of release need not conform to the rules of evidence. No
39 statement or admission of the defendant made at such a proceeding shall
40 be received as evidence in any subsequent proceeding against the
41 defendant.
42 (13)(m) The appearance bond and any security required as a condition
43 of the defendant's release shall be deposited in the office of the magistrate
SB 180 4
1 or the clerk of the court where the release is ordered. If the defendant is
2 bound to appear before a magistrate or court other than the one ordering
3 the release, the order of release, together with the bond and security shall
4 be transmitted to the magistrate or clerk of the court before whom the
5 defendant is bound to appear.
6 (14)(n) Proceedings before a magistrate as provided in this section to
7 determine the release conditions of a person charged with a crime
8 including release upon execution of an appearance bond may be conducted
9 by two-way electronic audio-video communication between the defendant
10 and the judge in lieu of personal presence of the defendant or defendant's
11 counsel in the courtroom in the discretion of the court. The defendant may
12 be accompanied by the defendant's counsel. The defendant shall be
13 informed of the defendant's right to be personally present in the courtroom
14 during such proceeding if the defendant so requests. Exercising the right to
15 be present shall in no way prejudice the defendant.
16 (15)(o) The magistrate may order the person to pay for any costs
17 associated with the supervision of the conditions of release of the
18 appearance bond in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of such
19 supervision. As a condition of sentencing under K.S.A. 21-6604, and
20 amendments thereto, the court may impose the full amount of any such
21 costs in addition to the $15 per week, including, but not limited to, costs
22 for treatment and evaluation under subsection (2) (b).
23 (p) If a defendant is charged with rape, as described in K.S.A. 21-
24 5503, and amendments thereto, criminal sodomy or aggravated criminal
25 sodomy, as described in K.S.A. 21-5504, and amendments thereto, sexual

29 amendments thereto, when setting the amount of an appearance bond and
30 conditions of release, the magistrate shall consider prior convictions of
31 such offenses or comparable out-of-state convictions.
32 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-2803 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
33 2803. A person who remains in custody after review of such person's
34 application pursuant to subsection (9) or (10) of K.S.A. 22-2802(i) or (j),
35 and amendments thereto, by a district magistrate judge may apply to a
36 district judge of the judicial district in which the charge is pending to
37 modify the order fixing conditions of release. Such motion shall be
38 determined promptly.
39 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 22-2802 and 22-2803 are hereby repealed.
40 Sec. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
