6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
9 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
10 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
11 with the modifications specified in this section.
12 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
13 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
14 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
15 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
16 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
17 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
18 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
19 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
20 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
21 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
22 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after
23 December 31, 1987, shall be excluded from computation of Kansas
24 adjusted gross income whether or not included in federal adjusted gross
25 income.
26 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
27 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
28 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not
29 credited against federal income tax. This paragraph shall not apply to taxes
30 imposed under the provisions of K.S.A. 79-1107 or 79-1108, and
31 amendments thereto, for privilege tax year 1995, and all such years
32 thereafter.

HB 2059 2
1 (iv) Federal income tax refunds received by the taxpayer if the
2 deduction of the taxes being refunded resulted in a tax benefit for Kansas
3 income tax purposes during a prior taxable year. Such refunds shall be
4 included in income in the year actually received regardless of the method
5 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
6 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
7 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
8 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
9 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
10 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
11 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
12 federal income taxes paid for such year. For purposes of the foregoing
13 sentence, federal taxes shall be considered to have been deducted only to
14 the extent such deduction does not reduce Kansas taxable income below
15 zero.

17 deduction claimed on the taxpayer's federal income tax return for any
