33 (ii) The department may intervene and participate in the matter to
34 ensure that a complaint is being investigated and resolved in the interest of
35 effective enforcement of this act or, alternatively, the department may
36 institute its own proceedings, in which case, the municipality, county, city,
37 town or village shall cease from acting on such matter so long as the
38 complaint is being investigated and resolved in the interest of effective
39 enforcement of this act.
40 (D) If the department does not, within 14 days of receiving a copy of
41 the complaint intervene or instigate its own proceedings, the municipality,
42 county, city, town or village may, without the department, investigate and
43 attempt to resolve the complaint and take additional means within its
SB 216 12
1 power to enforce this act against the subject of the complaint that is found

3 to compliance proceedings arising out of a single set of facts after having
4 already been subjected to a final compliance order by another
5 governmental entity.
6 (e) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the
7 department, a municipality, county, city, town or village to conduct
8 investigations and ascertain compliance with this act, establish and
9 implement a system to receive or resolve complaints, establish additional
10 means of enforcement or conduct outreach and education, including the
11 creation of notices and other written materials concerning this act if such
12 actions require the appropriation of funds to cover the costs of such
13 actions.
14 Sec. 9. (a) Any employer who willfully violates or fails to comply
15 with any of the provisions and requirements of this act shall be guilty of a
16 class C nonperson misdemeanor.
17 (b) For purposes of this section, each day of violation or failure to
18 comply and each employee affected shall constitute a separate offense.
19 Sec. 10. (a) Any individual who claims to have been aggrieved by a
20 failure of an employer to comply with any portion of this act, including,
21 but not limited to, the failure to provide earned paid sick time or allow
22 employees to use such time consistent with this act, or who claims to have
23 suffered a retaliatory personnel action shall have a right of action and may
24 commence a civil action in the appropriate court of jurisdiction within
25 three years of the accrual of the cause of action to obtain appropriate relief
26 with respect to such unlawful violation. Such action may be brought
27 without first filing an administrative complaint.
28 (b) In a civil action under this section, if the court finds a violation
29 has occurred, the court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate and to
30 the extent permitted by law:
31 (A) Any permanent or temporary injunction;
32 (B) the full amount of any unpaid earned paid sick time, plus any
33 actual damages suffered as the result of the employer's violation of this
34 act;
35 (C) an additional amount equal to two times any unpaid earned paid
36 sick time as liquidated damages, costs and reasonable attorney fees as may
37 be allowed by the court; and

41 Sec. 11. (a) Except as otherwise required by law, an employer shall
42 not require disclosure of details relating to an employee's or an employee's
43 family member's health information, domestic violence, sexual assault or
SB 216 13
1 stalking as a condition of providing earned paid sick time under this act.
2 (b) Unless as otherwise required by law, any health or safety
3 information possessed by an employer regarding an employee or
4 employee's family member shall:
5 (1) Be maintained on a separate form and in a separate file from other
6 personnel information;
7 (2) be treated as confidential medical records; and
8 (3) not be disclosed except to the affected employee or with the
9 express written permission of the affected employee.
10 Sec. 12. (a) With respect to employees covered by a valid collective
11 bargaining agreement in effect on July 1, 2025, no provision of this act
12 shall apply until the stated expiration date in the collective bargaining
13 agreement, except that the provisions of this act shall apply upon any such
14 agreement's renewal, extension, amendment or modification in any respect
15 after July 1, 2025.
16 (b) Nothing in this act shall be deemed to interfere, impede or
17 otherwise diminish the right of employees to bargain collectively through
18 representatives of their own choosing in order to establish earned paid sick
19 time or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable minimum
20 standards under the provisions of this act.
21 (c) Any waiver by an employee of rights under this act shall be
22 deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void.

24 (a) To discourage or prohibit an employer from the adoption or
25 retention of an earned paid sick time policy that provides greater benefits
26 than provided in this act;
27 (b) as diminishing the obligation of an employer to comply with any
28 contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan or
29 other agreement providing more paid sick time to an employee than
30 required by this act; or
31 (c) as diminishing the rights of public employees regarding paid sick
32 time or use of paid sick time as provided in the laws of Kansas and
33 ordinances of political subdivisions pertaining to public employees.
34 Sec. 14. (a) This act provides minimum requirements pertaining to
35 earned paid sick time and shall not be construed to preempt, limit or
36 otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement,
37 policy or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of
38 earned paid sick time or that extends other protections to employees.
39 (b) Nothing in this act shall be interpreted or applied to create a
40 power or obligation contrary to any federal law, rule or regulation.
41 Sec. 15. If any provision or clause of this act or application thereof to
42 any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect
43 other provisions or applications of this act that can be given effect without
SB 216 14
1 the invalid provision or application, and to this end, the provisions of this
2 act are declared to be severable.
3 Sec. 16. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
4 publication in the statute book.

35 (B) Alternatively, in lieu of carryover of unused earned paid sick time

19 (e) Any employer with a paid leave policy, such as a paid time off
20 policy, who makes available an amount of paid leave that is sufficient to
21 meet the accrual requirements of this section and may be used for the same
22 purposes and under the same conditions as earned paid sick time under this
23 act is not required to provide additional paid sick time under this section.
24 (f) Except as specifically provided in this section, nothing in this
25 section shall be construed as requiring an employer to provide financial or
26 other reimbursement to an employee for accrued earned paid sick time that
27 has not been used upon such employee's termination, resignation,
28 retirement or other separation from employment.
29 (g) Employees shall not accrue earned paid sick time before January
30 1, 2026.

29 means or by any other means acceptable to the employer. When possible,
30 the request shall include the expected duration of the absence.
31 (c) If the use of earned paid sick time is foreseeable, the employee
32 shall make a good faith effort to provide notice of the need for such time to
33 the employer in advance of the use of the earned paid sick time and make a
34 reasonable effort to schedule the use of earned paid sick time in a manner
35 that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer. If such a need
36 is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice
37 of the need for the use of earned paid sick time as soon as practicable.
38 (d) An employer that requires notice of the need to use earned paid
39 sick time for a need that is not foreseeable shall provide a written policy
40 that contains procedures for the employee to provide notice. An employer
41 that has not provided to the employee a copy of its written policy for
42 providing such notice shall not deny earned paid sick time to the employee
43 based on noncompliance with such a policy.

SB 216 8

12 earned paid sick time is necessary shall be considered reasonable
13 documentation for purposes of this section.
14 (2) In cases of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, if the
15 employer so requests, one of the following types of documentation
16 selected by the employee shall be considered reasonable documentation:

18 family member was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or
19 stalking;
20 (B) a written statement from an employee or agent of a victim service
21 provider affirming that the employee or employee's family member is or

29 (E) a written statement from the employee affirming that the
30 employee or employee's family member is taking or took earned paid sick
31 time for a qualifying purpose under subsection (a).
32 (3) An employer shall not require that the documentation explain the
33 nature of the illness, details of the underlying health needs or the details of
34 the domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, unless otherwise required
35 by law.
36 Sec. 4. (a) It shall be unlawful for an employer or any other person to
37 interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise
38 any right protected under this act.

5 violations of this act; and
6 (D) inform any person of such person's rights under this act.
7 (c) It shall be unlawful for an employer's absence control policy to
8 count earned paid sick time taken under this act as an absence that could
9 lead to or result in discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension or any other
10 adverse action.
11 (d) Protections of this section shall apply to any individual who
12 mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this act.

26 is subjected to retaliatory personnel action by the employer for exercising
27 such employee's rights under this act.
28 (2) The contact information for the department shall be provided by
29 the employer to the employee on a single sheet of paper at least 8.5" x 11"

35 (c) The department may create and make available to employers
36 model notices and posters that contain the information required under
37 subsection (a) for employers to use in complying with the requirements of

39 require the department to create or make available notices or posters if the
40 department requires the appropriation of funds to cover the costs of
41 creating or making such notices.

17 2030, unless the legislature acts to reenact such provisions. The provisions
18 of this paragraph shall be reviewed by the legislature prior to July 1, 2030.
19 (c) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the
20 department to access or inspect records or create forms relating to the
21 inspection of records if the department requires the appropriation of funds
22 to cover the costs of accessing or inspecting such records or creating such
23 forms.
24 Sec. 7. The secretary may adopt rules and regulations to implement
25 the provisions of this act.

4 other written materials to child care and elder care providers, domestic
5 violence shelters, schools, hospitals, community health centers and other

39 enforcement of this act.
40 (D) If the department does not, within 14 days of receiving a copy of
41 the complaint intervene or instigate its own proceedings, the municipality,
42 county, city, town or village may, without the department, investigate and
43 attempt to resolve the complaint and take additional means within its

SB 216 12
1 power to enforce this act against the subject of the complaint that is found
2 to not be complying with this act. In no event shall an employer be subject
3 to compliance proceedings arising out of a single set of facts after having

7 department, a municipality, county, city, town or village to conduct
8 investigations and ascertain compliance with this act, establish and
9 implement a system to receive or resolve complaints, establish additional
10 means of enforcement or conduct outreach and education, including the

12 actions require the appropriation of funds to cover the costs of such

21 but not limited to, the failure to provide earned paid sick time or allow
22 employees to use such time consistent with this act, or who claims to have
23 suffered a retaliatory personnel action shall have a right of action and may
24 commence a civil action in the appropriate court of jurisdiction within
25 three years of the accrual of the cause of action to obtain appropriate relief
26 with respect to such unlawful violation. Such action may be brought
27 without first filing an administrative complaint.
28 (b) In a civil action under this section, if the court finds a violation
29 has occurred, the court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate and to
30 the extent permitted by law:

32 (B) the full amount of any unpaid earned paid sick time, plus any
33 actual damages suffered as the result of the employer's violation of this

1 stalking as a condition of providing earned paid sick time under this act.
2 (b) Unless as otherwise required by law, any health or safety
3 information possessed by an employer regarding an employee or
4 employee's family member shall:
5 (1) Be maintained on a separate form and in a separate file from other
6 personnel information;
7 (2) be treated as confidential medical records; and
8 (3) not be disclosed except to the affected employee or with the
9 express written permission of the affected employee.
10 Sec. 12. (a) With respect to employees covered by a valid collective
11 bargaining agreement in effect on July 1, 2025, no provision of this act
12 shall apply until the stated expiration date in the collective bargaining
13 agreement, except that the provisions of this act shall apply upon any such
14 agreement's renewal, extension, amendment or modification in any respect
15 after July 1, 2025.
16 (b) Nothing in this act shall be deemed to interfere, impede or
17 otherwise diminish the right of employees to bargain collectively through

20 standards under the provisions of this act.
21 (c) Any waiver by an employee of rights under this act shall be
22 deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void.

24 (a) To discourage or prohibit an employer from the adoption or
25 retention of an earned paid sick time policy that provides greater benefits
26 than provided in this act;
27 (b) as diminishing the obligation of an employer to comply with any
28 contract, collective bargaining agreement, employment benefit plan or
29 other agreement providing more paid sick time to an employee than
30 required by this act; or
31 (c) as diminishing the rights of public employees regarding paid sick
32 time or use of paid sick time as provided in the laws of Kansas and
33 ordinances of political subdivisions pertaining to public employees.
34 Sec. 14. (a) This act provides minimum requirements pertaining to
35 earned paid sick time and shall not be construed to preempt, limit or
36 otherwise affect the applicability of any other law, regulation, requirement,
37 policy or standard that provides for greater accrual or use by employees of
38 earned paid sick time or that extends other protections to employees.
39 (b) Nothing in this act shall be interpreted or applied to create a
40 power or obligation contrary to any federal law, rule or regulation.
41 Sec. 15. If any provision or clause of this act or application thereof to
42 any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect
43 other provisions or applications of this act that can be given effect without

SB 216 14
1 the invalid provision or application, and to this end, the provisions of this
2 act are declared to be severable.
3 Sec. 16. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
4 publication in the statute book.
