26 passenger vehicle under the laws of this state. One Such personalized
27 license plate shall be displayed on the rear of the vehicle and, at the option
28 of the owner or lessee, the other license plate may be displayed on the
29 front of the vehicle, except that no registration decal shall be issued
30 pursuant to K.S.A. 8-134, and amendments thereto, for any such license
31 plate displayed on the front of such vehicle. One personalized license plate
32 may be issued to any owner of a motorcycle upon proper application in the
33 same manner provided in this subsection for passenger vehicles and trucks.

7 assigned shall be deemed the registration number of such vehicle. Subject
8 to the foregoing provisions, all license plates issued under this section
9 shall be manufactured in accordance with K.S.A. 8-147, and amendments
10 thereto. Such license plates shall be issued for a registration period of five

19 use or tow such vehicle on the highway shall expire at 12 midnight on the
20 last day of the last month of the 12-month period for which such vehicle

23 registration period for each passenger vehicle in order to as nearly as
24 feasible equalize registration or reregistration within the 12 months of the
25 year. Any vehicle after having once been registered shall upon
26 reregistration, be registered for the same twelve-month period except when
27 the certificate of title has been transferred as provided by law. In this case,

HB 2289—Am. by SC 5
1 shall change the color of such decals each year, without duplicating the
2 same color in any five-year period or such extended period as the director
3 designates under K.S.A. 8-132(b), and amendments thereto. Such decals
4 shall be so constructed that once a decal has been affixed to a license plate,
5 it cannot be removed without destroying the decal, and the surface of such

26 permit, the applicant shall consent to the sharing of information, including,
27 but not limited to, the applicant's name, address, email address and phone
28 number, with the secretary of wildlife and parks by the division of motor
29 vehicles.

14 entered into under this section shall be substantially equivalent to such
15 costs under prior contracts, with the cost of license plates increased in the
16 amount of the cost of coating with reflective material, but any such
17 contract shall not be subject to the provisions of K.S.A. 75-3739, and
18 amendments thereto.

24 except that once all allowable combinations of letters and numerals have
25 been used, each license plate shall contain an arrangement of numerals or
26 letters, or both, as shall be assigned by the secretary of revenue. The
27 arrangement of numerals and letters of license plates shall be uniform
28 throughout each classification of registration. The secretary may provide
29 for the arrangement of the numerals and letters in groups or otherwise and
30 for other distinguishing marks on such license plates. The secretary of
31 revenue shall design decals to be affixed to the license plates to identify
32 the county by two letters chosen from the name of the county distinctly
33 indicative of the name of the county in which the vehicle is registered and
34 the date registration is to expire expiration information consistent with
35 K.S.A. 8-134, and amendments thereto. The letters and numerals of such
36 license plates shall be in such contrast of colors to the background of the
37 license plate as to make such letters and numerals easily read readable.
38 (d) As new license plates are issued, the face of every license plate
39 shall be completely coated with a reflective material. The reflectorized
40 material shall be of such nature as to provide effective and dependable
41 performance in the promotion of highway safety and vehicle identification
42 throughout the service period for which the license plates are issued. The
43 sum of $.50 shall be added to the cost of each reflectorized license plate.
HB 2289—Am. by SC 7
1 The director shall change the color of such license plates every time new
2 license plates are issued under subsection (b) of K.S.A. 8-132(b), and
3 amendments thereto. The quantity of license plates and registration decals
4 to be furnished each county shall be computed upon the basis of the
5 number of motor vehicles registered and reregistered in such county for
6 the preceding year, and additional license plates and decals shall be
7 furnished as required.

9 manufacture of license plates and decals shall provide that the license
10 plates and decals, other than prorate license plates and prorate backing
11 plates, shall be shipped directly to the treasurer of the county where they
12 are to be used or, for digitally-fulfilled license plate order, directly to the
13 customer for whom the plate is issued. Any such contract for the
14 manufacture of state corporation commission identification tags shall
15 provide that such tags shall be shipped directly to the state corporation
16 commission.
17 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 8-132 and 8-147 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-134 are
18 hereby repealed.

37 Except vehicles subject to K.S.A. 8-134a, and amendments thereto, and
38 passenger vehicles, the renewal shall take effect on January 1 of each year,
39 but the owner of the vehicle shall have until and including the last day of
40 February of each year to make application for such renewal. The division
41 shall issue for such vehicles a February month decal to correspond with
42 the statutory grace period. Criminal sanctions provided in K.S.A. 8-142,
43 and amendments thereto, for failure to display any license plate or plates

HB 2289—Am. by SC 4
1 or any registration decal required to be affixed to any such license plate for
2 the current registration year shall not be enforced until March 1 of each
3 year. An owner who has made proper application for renewal of
4 registration of a vehicle prior to January 1, but who has not received the
5 license plate or registration card for the ensuing year, shall be entitled to
6 operate or permit the operation of such vehicle upon the highways upon
7 displaying thereon the license plate issued for the preceding year for such
8 time as the director of vehicles finds necessary for issuance of such new
9 license plate.
10 (b) Every passenger vehicle required by this act to be registered,
11 except as otherwise provided, shall be registered for a period of 12
12 consecutive months. The division of vehicles, in order to initiate a system
13 of registering or reregistering passenger vehicles during any month of a
14 calendar year, may register or reregister a passenger vehicle for less than a
15 12-month period, prorating the annual registration fee, when in the
16 director's opinion such proration tends to fulfill the purpose of the monthly
17 registration system.
18 (c) Passenger vehicle registration, and the authority to legally operate,
19 use or tow such vehicle on the highway shall expire at 12 midnight on the
20 last day of the last month of the 12-month period for which such vehicle
21 was registered, and the owner shall see that such vehicle is reregistered as
22 required by this act. The director of vehicles shall designate the
23 registration period for each passenger vehicle in order to as nearly as
24 feasible equalize registration or reregistration within the 12 months of the
25 year. Any vehicle after having once been registered shall upon
26 reregistration, be registered for the same twelve-month period except when
27 the certificate of title has been transferred as provided by law. In this case,
28 the vehicle shall be registered by the division of vehicles in accordance
29 with the system adopted.
30 (d) For the purpose of this act, hearses and electrically propelled
31 vehicles shall be classified as passenger vehicles.
32 (e) Every owner who registers or reregisters a vehicle in a calendar
33 year, and in any calendar year in which a license plate is not issued for the
34 renewal of registration of such vehicle, shall be furnished by the division
35 one decal for the license plate issued for such vehicle and required by
36 K.S.A. 8-133, and amendments thereto, to be affixed to the rear of such
37 vehicle. Such decal shall be affixed to the number plate affixed to the rear
38 of such vehicle and shall contain the letters designating the county in
39 which such vehicle is registered, as provided in K.S.A. 8-147, and
40 amendments thereto, shall indicate the license plate number for which the
41 decal is to be affixed and shall indicate the year in which such registration
42 expires. The color of a decal shall be such that it contrasts with the color of
43 the license plate to which it is to be affixed, and the director of vehicles

HB 2289—Am. by SC 5
1 shall change the color of such decals each year, without duplicating the
2 same color in any five-year period or such extended period as the director
3 designates under K.S.A. 8-132(b), and amendments thereto. Such decals
4 shall be so constructed that once a decal has been affixed to a license plate,
5 it cannot be removed without destroying the decal, and the surface of such
6 decals shall be capable of reflecting light. Consistent with the foregoing,
7 the director of vehicles shall prescribe the size of and material to be used
8 in the production of such decals, and the director of vehicles shall
9 designate the location on a number plate where such decal shall be affixed.
10 (f) (1) The owner of a vehicle may, at the time of such registration or
11 reregistration, purchase a park and recreation motor vehicle permit. Such
12 permit shall cost $15 until such time as the amount for such permit is
13 changed by rules and regulations of the secretary of wildlife and parks.
14 (2) Such permit shall be nontransferable and shall expire on the date
15 of expiration of the vehicle registration.
16 (3) Except as provided in subsection (f)(4), the county treasurer shall
17 remit all such moneys paid to the county treasurer to the state treasurer in
18 accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments
19 thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall
20 deposit the entire amount in the state treasury and shall be credited as
21 provided in K.S.A. 32-991, and amendments thereto.
22 (4) The county treasurer may collect and retain a service charge fee of
23 up to $.50 for each park and recreation motor vehicle permit issued or sold
24 by the county treasurer.
25 (5) As a condition of receiving the park and recreation motor vehicle
26 permit, the applicant shall consent to the sharing of information, including,
27 but not limited to, the applicant's name, address, email address and phone
28 number, with the secretary of wildlife and parks by the division of motor
29 vehicles.
30 (g) The secretary of revenue shall adopt rules and regulations
31 necessary to accomplish the purpose of this act.
32 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 8-147 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-147. (a)
33 As used in this section, "license plate" means the plate used to externally
34 evidence registration of a vehicle under chapter 8 of Kansas Statutes
35 Annotated.
36 (b) Prior to November 1 of each year, the director of vehicles shall
37 furnish the secretary of revenue with complete and detailed specifications
38 for the manufacture of all license plates and registration decals, together
39 with the number required for delivery in the succeeding year for use
40 during the following year, and. The state corporation commission shall
41 furnish the secretary of revenue with complete and detailed specifications
42 for the manufacture of identification tags together with the number
43 required for delivery in the succeeding year for use in the following year.

HB 2289—Am. by SC 6
1 The secretary of revenue shall cause to be manufactured all license plates
2 and registration decals and state corporation commission identification
3 tags based on such specifications and estimates. For such purpose, the
4 secretary of revenue shall enter into a contract for the manufacture of
5 license plates, tags and decals with any organization or institution
6 designated in K.S.A. 39-1208, and amendments thereto. Any such contract
7 may provide that the secretary of revenue shall furnish or cause to be
8 furnished the materials and supplies necessary for the manufacture and
9 distribution of license plates, tags and decals if, in the opinion of the
10 secretary of revenue, a reduction in the cost of manufacturing and
11 distribution of the license plates, tags and decals under such contract will
12 be achieved. Subject to the foregoing, the cost to the state for the
13 manufacture of the license plates, tags and decals pursuant to any contract
14 entered into under this section shall be substantially equivalent to such
15 costs under prior contracts, with the cost of license plates increased in the
16 amount of the cost of coating with reflective material, but any such
17 contract shall not be subject to the provisions of K.S.A. 75-3739, and
18 amendments thereto.
19 (c) Except as authorized by other provisions of law, license plates,
20 beginning in the year in which new license plates are issued pursuant to
21 K.S.A. 8-132, and amendments thereto, shall be lettered, numbered and
22 designed as provided in this section. Each license plate shall contain a
23 combination of three letters followed by a combination of three numerals,
24 except that once all allowable combinations of letters and numerals have
25 been used, each license plate shall contain an arrangement of numerals or
26 letters, or both, as shall be assigned by the secretary of revenue. The
27 arrangement of numerals and letters of license plates shall be uniform
28 throughout each classification of registration. The secretary may provide
29 for the arrangement of the numerals and letters in groups or otherwise and
30 for other distinguishing marks on such license plates. The secretary of
31 revenue shall design decals to be affixed to the license plates to identify
32 the county by two letters chosen from the name of the county distinctly
33 indicative of the name of the county in which the vehicle is registered and
34 the date registration is to expire expiration information consistent with
35 K.S.A. 8-134, and amendments thereto. The letters and numerals of such
36 license plates shall be in such contrast of colors to the background of the
37 license plate as to make such letters and numerals easily read readable.
38 (d) As new license plates are issued, the face of every license plate
39 shall be completely coated with a reflective material. The reflectorized
40 material shall be of such nature as to provide effective and dependable
41 performance in the promotion of highway safety and vehicle identification
42 throughout the service period for which the license plates are issued. The
43 sum of $.50 shall be added to the cost of each reflectorized license plate.

HB 2289—Am. by SC 7
1 The director shall change the color of such license plates every time new
2 license plates are issued under subsection (b) of K.S.A. 8-132(b), and
3 amendments thereto. The quantity of license plates and registration decals
4 to be furnished each county shall be computed upon the basis of the
5 number of motor vehicles registered and reregistered in such county for
6 the preceding year, and additional license plates and decals shall be
7 furnished as required.
8 (e) Any contract entered into pursuant to this section for the
9 manufacture of license plates and decals shall provide that the license
10 plates and decals, other than prorate license plates and prorate backing
11 plates, shall be shipped directly to the treasurer of the county where they
12 are to be used or, for digitally-fulfilled license plate order, directly to the
13 customer for whom the plate is issued. Any such contract for the
14 manufacture of state corporation commission identification tags shall
15 provide that such tags shall be shipped directly to the state corporation
16 commission.
17 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 8-132 and 8-147 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-134 are
18 hereby repealed.
19 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
20 publication in the statute book Kansas register.
