21 described in such agent's affidavit or statement from loss or damage in
22 regularly admitted companies during the preceding year. Mere rate
23 differential shall not be grounds for placing a particular risk in with a
24 nonadmitted carrier insurer when an admitted carrier insurer would accept
25 such risk at a different rate. The licensed excess coverage agent must shall,
26 prior to placing insurance with an eligible nonadmitted insurer not
27 authorized to do business in this state, obtain the written consent of the
28 prospective named insured and provide such insured the following

1 (c) In the event the insured desires that coverage be bound with an

3 possible to obtain the written consent of the insured prior to binding the
4 coverage, the excess lines agent may bind the coverage after advising the
5 insured of the information set out above and shall obtain written
6 confirmation that the insured desires that coverage be placed with an
7 insurer not admitted to this state eligible nonadmitted insurer within 30
8 days after binding coverage.

11 do business in this state eligible nonadmitted insurer from an agent not

14 the preceding information and has consented to being insured with an
15 insurer not authorized to do business in this state eligible nonadmitted
16 insurer. Each excess lines agent shall keep a separate record book in such
17 agent's office showing the transactions of fire and casualty insurance and

27 same reasons prescribed by K.S.A. 40-4909, and amendments thereto.

29 stamped or endorsed in a prominent manner thereon, the following: This
30 policy is issued by an insurer not authorized to do business eligible
31 nonadmitted insurer in Kansas and, as such, the form, financial condition
32 and rates are not subject to review by the commissioner of insurance and
33 the insured is not protected by any guaranty fund.
34 (3) If business is placed with a nonadmitted company that is
35 subsequently determined to be insolvent, the excess lines agent placing
36 such business with such company is relieved of any responsibility to the
37 insured as it relates to such insolvency, if the excess lines agent has
38 satisfactorily complied with all requirements of this section pertaining to
