23 resolution. In exercising the foregoing powers, the board, in conformity
24 with the provisions of this act, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
25 may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, and to that
26 end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken,
27 may attach appropriate conditions, and may issue or direct the issuance of
28 a permit.
29 (e) When deemed necessary by the board of zoning appeals, the
30 board may grant variances and exceptions from the zoning regulations on
31 the following basis and in the manner hereinafter provided:
32 (1) To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms
33 of the regulations which that will not be contrary to the public interest and
34 where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
35 the regulations, in an individual case, results in unnecessary hardship, and
36 provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety
37 and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
38 permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A
39 request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the
40 board that all of the following conditions have been met:
41 (A) That the variance requested arises from such condition which
42 that is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found
43 in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of
HB 2088—Am. by HCW 8
1 the property owner or the applicant;
2 (B) that the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely
3 affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
4 (C) that the strict application of the provisions of the zoning
5 regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
6 hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
7 (D) that the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
8 health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
9 and
10 (E) that granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
11 general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations; and
12 (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in
13 those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such
14 exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event
15 shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted
16 where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an
17 exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the
18 board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when
19 conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning regulation by the
20 governing body, are not found to be present.
21 (f) Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any
22 order or determination of the board, including a decision deemed to have
23 been made pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, may bring an
24 action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of
25 any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days
26 of the final decision of the board.
27 (g) A planning commission also may be designated as a board of
28 zoning appeals under this section.

36 provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety
37 and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
38 permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A
39 request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the
40 board that all of the following conditions have been met:
41 (A) That the variance requested arises from such condition which
42 that is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found
43 in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of

1 the property owner or the applicant;
2 (B) that the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely
3 affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
4 (C) that the strict application of the provisions of the zoning
5 regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
6 hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
7 (D) that the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
8 health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
9 and
10 (E) that granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
11 general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations; and
12 (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in
13 those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such
14 exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event
15 shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted
16 where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an
17 exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the
18 board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when
19 conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning regulation by the
20 governing body, are not found to be present.
21 (f) Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any
22 order or determination of the board, including a decision deemed to have
23 been made pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, may bring an
24 action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of
25 any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days
26 of the final decision of the board.
27 (g) A planning commission also may be designated as a board of
28 zoning appeals under this section.
