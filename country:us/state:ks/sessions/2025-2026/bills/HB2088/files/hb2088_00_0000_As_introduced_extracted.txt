22 county newspaper in the case of a county at least 20 days prior to the date
23 fixed for hearing. Such notice shall also be provided at such time on the
24 website of the city or county, if the city or county has a website. A copy of
25 the notice shall be mailed to each party to the appeal and to the appropriate
26 planning commission.

28 person aggrieved, or by any officer of the city, county or any governmental
29 agency or body affected by any decision of the officer administering the
30 provisions of the zoning ordinance or resolution. Such appeal shall be
31 taken within a reasonable time as provided by the rules of the board, by

34 notified by the board or its agent, shall transmit to the board all the papers
35 constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.

37 there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by

39 resolution. In exercising the foregoing powers, the board, in conformity
40 with the provisions of this act, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
41 may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, and to that
42 end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken,
43 may attach appropriate conditions, and may issue or direct the issuance of
HB 2088 7
1 a permit.
2 (e) When deemed necessary by the board of zoning appeals, the
3 board may grant variances and exceptions from the zoning regulations on
4 the following basis and in the manner hereinafter provided:
5 (1) To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms
6 of the regulations which that will not be contrary to the public interest and
7 where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
8 the regulations, in an individual case, results in unnecessary hardship, and
9 provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety
10 and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
11 permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A
12 request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the
13 board that all of the following conditions have been met:
14 (A) That the variance requested arises from such condition which
15 that is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found
16 in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of
17 the property owner or the applicant;
18 (B) that the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely
19 affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
20 (C) that the strict application of the provisions of the zoning
21 regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
22 hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
23 (D) that the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
24 health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
25 and
26 (E) that granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
27 general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations; and
28 (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in
29 those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such
30 exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event
31 shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted
32 where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an
33 exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the
34 board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when
35 conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning regulation by the
36 governing body, are not found to be present.
37 (f) Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any
38 order or determination of the board, including a decision deemed to have
39 been made pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, may bring an
40 action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of
41 any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days
42 of the final decision of the board.
43 (g) A planning commission also may be designated as a board of
HB 2088 8
1 zoning appeals under this section.
2 (h) The provisions of this section shall become effective on and after
3 January 1, 1992 the fast-track permits act, sections 1 through 3, and
4 amendments thereto, shall apply to this section.
5 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 12-752 and 12-759 are hereby repealed.

37 of one, two and three years, divided equally or as nearly equally as
38 possible among the members. Thereafter the terms of the members may be

4 such other times as the board may determine. The board shall keep
5 minutes of its proceedings, showing evidence presented, findings of fact
6 by the board, decisions of the board and the vote upon each question.
7 Records of all official actions of the board shall be filed in its office and
8 shall be a public record. The governing body, in the ordinance or
9 resolution creating such board, may establish a scale of reasonable fees to
10 be paid in advance by the party appealing. Any two or more cities or
11 counties which that have established a joint planning commission may
12 establish a joint board of zoning appeals.
13 (b) Any board of zoning appeals in existence on the effective date of
14 this act shall continue in existence, but shall be governed by the provisions
15 of this act.
16 (c) The board of zoning appeals shall administer the details of appeals
17 from or other matters referred to it regarding the application of the zoning

19 reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal or any other matter referred to
20 it. Notice of the time, place and subject of such hearing shall be published
21 once in the official city newspaper in the case of a city and in the official
22 county newspaper in the case of a county at least 20 days prior to the date
23 fixed for hearing. Such notice shall also be provided at such time on the
24 website of the city or county, if the city or county has a website. A copy of
25 the notice shall be mailed to each party to the appeal and to the appropriate
26 planning commission.
27 (d) Appeals to the board of zoning appeals may be taken by any
28 person aggrieved, or by any officer of the city, county or any governmental
29 agency or body affected by any decision of the officer administering the
30 provisions of the zoning ordinance or resolution. Such appeal shall be
31 taken within a reasonable time as provided by the rules of the board, by
32 filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof and the payment of
33 the fee required therefor. The officer from whom the appeal is taken, when
34 notified by the board or its agent, shall transmit to the board all the papers
35 constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
36 The board shall have power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
37 there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
38 an administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance or
39 resolution. In exercising the foregoing powers, the board, in conformity
40 with the provisions of this act, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
41 may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, and to that
42 end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken,
43 may attach appropriate conditions, and may issue or direct the issuance of

HB 2088 7
1 a permit.
2 (e) When deemed necessary by the board of zoning appeals, the
3 board may grant variances and exceptions from the zoning regulations on
4 the following basis and in the manner hereinafter provided:
5 (1) To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms
6 of the regulations which that will not be contrary to the public interest and
7 where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
8 the regulations, in an individual case, results in unnecessary hardship, and
9 provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety
10 and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
11 permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A
12 request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the
13 board that all of the following conditions have been met:
14 (A) That the variance requested arises from such condition which
15 that is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found
16 in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of
17 the property owner or the applicant;
18 (B) that the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely
19 affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
20 (C) that the strict application of the provisions of the zoning
21 regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
22 hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
23 (D) that the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
24 health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
25 and
26 (E) that granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
27 general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations; and
28 (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in
29 those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such
30 exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event
31 shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted
32 where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an
33 exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the
34 board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when
35 conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning regulation by the
36 governing body, are not found to be present.
37 (f) Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any
38 order or determination of the board, including a decision deemed to have
39 been made pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, may bring an
40 action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of
41 any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days
42 of the final decision of the board.
43 (g) A planning commission also may be designated as a board of

HB 2088 8
1 zoning appeals under this section.
2 (h) The provisions of this section shall become effective on and after
3 January 1, 1992 the fast-track permits act, sections 1 through 3, and
4 amendments thereto, shall apply to this section.
5 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 12-752 and 12-759 are hereby repealed.
