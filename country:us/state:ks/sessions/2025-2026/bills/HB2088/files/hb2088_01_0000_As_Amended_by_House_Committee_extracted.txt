21 resolution. In exercising the foregoing powers, the board, in conformity
22 with the provisions of this act, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or

31 of the regulations which that will not be contrary to the public interest and
32 where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
33 the regulations, in an individual case, results in unnecessary hardship, and
34 provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety
35 and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
36 permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A
37 request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the
38 board that all of the following conditions have been met:
39 (A) That the variance requested arises from such condition which
40 that is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found
41 in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of
42 the property owner or the applicant;
43 (B) that the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely
HB 2088—Am. by HC 8
1 affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
2 (C) that the strict application of the provisions of the zoning
3 regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
4 hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
5 (D) that the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
6 health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
7 and
8 (E) that granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
9 general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations; and
10 (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in
11 those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such
12 exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event
13 shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted
14 where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an
15 exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the
16 board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when
17 conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning regulation by the
18 governing body, are not found to be present.
19 (f) Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any
20 order or determination of the board, including a decision deemed to have
21 been made pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, may bring an
22 action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of
23 any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days
24 of the final decision of the board.
25 (g) A planning commission also may be designated as a board of
26 zoning appeals under this section.
27 (h) The provisions of this section shall become effective on and after

34 provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed, public safety
35 and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
36 permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district. A
37 request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the
38 board that all of the following conditions have been met:
39 (A) That the variance requested arises from such condition which
40 that is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found
41 in the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of
42 the property owner or the applicant;
43 (B) that the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely

HB 2088—Am. by HC 8
1 affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;

3 regulations of which variance is requested will constitute unnecessary
4 hardship upon the property owner represented in the application;
5 (D) that the variance desired will not adversely affect the public
6 health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare;
7 and
8 (E) that granting the variance desired will not be opposed to the
9 general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations; and
10 (2) to grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in
11 those instances where the board is specifically authorized to grant such
12 exceptions and only under the terms of the zoning regulation. In no event
13 shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation be granted
14 where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an
15 exception in the zoning regulation. Further, under no conditions shall the
16 board of zoning appeals have the power to grant an exception when
17 conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning regulation by the
18 governing body, are not found to be present.
19 (f) Any person, official or governmental agency dissatisfied with any
20 order or determination of the board, including a decision deemed to have
21 been made pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, may bring an
22 action in the district court of the county to determine the reasonableness of
23 any such order or determination. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days
24 of the final decision of the board.
