5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 New Section 1. (a) The driver of a motor vehicle, upon approaching a
8 stopped, standing or parked vehicle that is displaying hazard warning
9 signal lamps, road flares or caution signals, including traffic cones, caution
10 signs or reflective triangles, shall do either of the following:
11 (1) If the driver of the motor vehicle is traveling on a highway that
12 consists of at least two lanes that carry traffic in the same direction of
13 travel as that of the driver's motor vehicle, the driver shall proceed with
14 due caution and, if possible and with due regard to the road, weather and
15 traffic conditions, shall change lanes into a lane that is not adjacent to that
16 of the stationary vehicle; or
17 (2) if the driver is not traveling on a highway of a type described in
18 paragraph (1), or if the driver is traveling on a highway of that type but it
19 is not possible to change lanes or if to do so would be unsafe, the driver
20 shall proceed with due caution, reduce the speed of the motor vehicle and
21 maintain a safe speed for the road, weather and traffic conditions.
22 (b) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the uniform act
23 regulating traffic on highways.
24 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 8-2118 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-2118.
25 (a) A person charged with a traffic infraction shall, except as provided in
26 subsection (b), appear at the place and time specified in the notice to
27 appear. If the person enters an appearance, waives right to trial, pleads
28 guilty or no contest, the fine shall be no greater than that specified in the
29 uniform fine schedule in subsection (c) and court costs shall be taxed as
30 provided by law.
31 (b) Prior to the time specified in the notice to appear, a person
32 charged with a traffic infraction may enter a written appearance, waive
33 right to trial, plead guilty or no contest and pay the fine for the violation as
34 specified in the uniform fine schedule in subsection (c) and court costs
35 provided by law. Payment may be made in any manner accepted by the
36 court. The traffic citation shall not have been complied with if the payment

SB 8 2
1 is not honored for any reason, or if the fine and court costs are not paid in
2 full. When a person charged with a traffic infraction makes payment
3 without executing a written waiver of right to trial and plea of guilty or no
4 contest, the payment shall be deemed such an appearance, waiver of right
5 to trial and plea of no contest.
6 (c) The following uniform fine schedule shall apply uniformly
7 throughout the state but shall not limit the fine that may be imposed
8 following a court appearance, except an appearance made for the purpose
