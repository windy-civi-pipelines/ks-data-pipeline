24 regular, it such sale shall be confirmed, and the sheriff ordered to forthwith
25 immediately execute to the purchasers at such sale a good and sufficient
26 deed therefor.
27 (d) If one person or the county purchases more than one tract, lot or
28 piece of real estate, the same may be included in one deed. The deed shall
29 be executed by the sheriff and acknowledged before the clerk of the
30 district court. No particular form of deed shall be required. It The deed

33 estate was sold, the name of the purchaser, the date such sale was
34 confirmed by the court and the title of the suit in which the tax lien was
35 foreclosed. The deed shall be filed for record, by the sheriff at the time the
36 deed is executed, in the office of the register of deeds of the county where
37 such real estate is situated. Any fee or charge for such filing shall be
38 collected from the successful bidder at the time of sale and deposited with

42 parties to such proceedings, a fee simple title thereto, subject only to valid
43 covenants running with the land and valid easement of record in use and
SB 192 3
1 subject to taxes and interest which that have become a lien thereon,
2 subsequent to the date upon which such judgment was rendered. Such
3 deed shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity of all proceedings
4 prior to the date of filing the same for record.
5 (e) After the sale and confirmation thereof by the court, an execution
6 shall issue, upon praecipe of the county attorney, county counselor or the

12 real estate shall be eliminated from the assessment and tax rolls until such
13 time as such real estate is sold as provided by K.S.A. 79-2804f, and
14 amendments thereto.
