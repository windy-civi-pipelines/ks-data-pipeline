4 substance analog or prior drug screening records of the applicant or
5 recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
6 substance analog.
7 (B) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
8 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
9 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
10 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
11 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
12 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who

28 programs, such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance may be
29 subject to periodic drug screening, as determined by the secretary.
30 (F) Upon a second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled
31 substance or controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance
32 shall be ordered to complete again a substance abuse treatment program
33 and job skills program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a
34 period of 12 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes

7 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
8 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an
9 individual to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's
10 minor child, as approved by the secretary. Prior to the designated
11 individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary shall review
12 whether reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual is
13 unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
14 (B) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
15 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
16 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
17 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.

22 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug
23 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a

31 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
32 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
33 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
34 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the
35 cost of such additional drug screening.
36 (D) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
37 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
38 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
39 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary to
40 receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's or legal guardian's
41 minor child.

1 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
2 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
3 analog, and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person
4 shall thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance
5 under this subsection unless such conviction is the person's first
6 conviction. First-time offenders convicted under federal or state law of
7 any offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and
8 has as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation,
9 distribution, possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled

18 disqualified if such individual has been convicted of a state or federal
19 felony offense occurring on or after July 1, 2015, involving possession or
20 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
21 (B) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), an
22 individual shall be eligible for food assistance if the individual enrolls in
23 and participates in a drug treatment program approved by the secretary,
24 submits to and passes a drug test and agrees to submit to drug testing if
25 requested by the department pursuant to a drug testing plan.
26 (ii) An individual's failure to submit to testing or failure to
27 successfully pass a drug test shall result in ineligibility for food assistance

30 result in ineligibility for food assistance until a drug treatment plan
31 approved by the secretary is successfully completed, the individual passes

4 5701, and amendments thereto, and 21 U.S.C. § 802.

7 (d) Temporary assistance for needy families;
8 (g) Assignment of support rights and limited power of attorney. (1)
9 By applying for or receiving temporary assistance for needy families such
10 applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned to the secretary on
11 behalf of the state any accrued, present or future rights to support from any
12 other person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in
13 behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for
14 or receiving aid. In any case in which an order for child support has been
15 established and the legal custodian and obligee under the order surrenders
16 physical custody of the child to a caretaker relative without obtaining a
17 modification of legal custody and support rights on behalf of the child are
18 assigned pursuant to this section, the surrender of physical custody and the
19 assignment shall transfer, by operation of law, the child's support rights
20 under the order to the secretary on behalf of the state. Such assignment
21 shall be of all accrued, present or future rights to support of the child
22 surrendered to the caretaker relative. The assignment of support rights
23 shall automatically become effective upon the date of approval for or
24 receipt of such aid without the requirement that any document be signed
25 by the applicant, recipient or obligee. By applying for or receiving
26 temporary assistance for needy families, or by surrendering physical
27 custody of a child to a caretaker relative who is an applicant or recipient of
28 such assistance on the child's behalf, the applicant, recipient or obligee is
29 also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as
30 an attorney-in-fact to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing
31 all drafts, checks, money orders or other negotiable instruments
32 representing support payments received by the secretary in behalf of any
33 person applying for, receiving or having received such assistance. This
34 limited power of attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary
35 approves the application for aid and shall remain in effect until the
36 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
37 (2) If the applicant or recipient of TANF is a mother of the dependent
38 child, as a condition of the mother's eligibility for TANF, the mother shall
39 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
40 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
41 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
42 recipient of TANF who fails to cooperate with requirements relating to
43 child support services under criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules
HB 2027 20
1 and regulations of the secretary shall be subject to a penalty established
2 by the secretary.
3 (3) In any case in which the secretary pays for the expenses of care
4 and custody of a child pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et
5 seq., and amendments thereto, including the expenses of any foster care
6 placement, an assignment of all past, present and future support rights of
7 the child in custody possessed by either parent or other person entitled to
8 receive support payments for the child is, by operation of law, conveyed to
9 the secretary. Such assignment shall become effective upon placement of a
10 child in the custody of the secretary or upon payment of the expenses of
11 care and custody of a child by the secretary without the requirement that
12 any document be signed by the parent or other person entitled to receive
13 support payments for the child. When the secretary pays for the expenses
14 of care and custody of a child or a child is placed in the custody of the
15 secretary, the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments
16 for the child is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
17 secretary's designee, as attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
18 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
19 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
20 secretary on behalf of the child. This limited power of attorney shall be
21 effective from the date the assignment to support rights becomes effective
22 and shall remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been
23 terminated in full.
24 (4) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food
25 assistance, the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned,
26 pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on
27 behalf of the state only accrued, present or future rights to support from
28 any other person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or
29 in behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying
30 for or receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically
31 become effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid
32 without the requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or
33 recipient. By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food
34 assistance, the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
35 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the
36 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
37 or other negotiable instruments representing support payments received by
38 the secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
39 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
40 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
41 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
42 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
43 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
HB 2027 21
1 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
2 or recipients of TANF.
3 (h) Electronic benefits card. (1) The secretary shall place a
4 photograph of the recipient, if agreed to by such recipient of public
5 assistance, on any Kansas benefits card issued by the Kansas department
6 for children and families that the recipient uses in obtaining food, cash or
7 any other services. When a recipient of public assistance is a minor or
8 otherwise incapacitated individual, a parent or legal guardian of such
9 recipient may have a photograph of such parent or legal guardian placed
10 on the card.
11 (2) Any Kansas benefits card with a photograph of a recipient shall
12 be valid for voting purposes as a public assistance identification card in
13 accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments
14 thereto.
15 (3) The Kansas department for children and families shall monitor
16 all recipient requests for a Kansas benefits card replacement and, upon
17 the fourth such request in a 12-month period, send a notice alerting the
18 recipient that the recipient's account is being monitored for potential
19 suspicious activity. If a recipient makes an additional request for
20 replacement subsequent to such notice, the department shall refer the
21 investigation to the department's fraud investigation unit.
22 (4) As used in this subsection, "Kansas benefits card" means any card
23 issued to provide food assistance, cash assistance or child care assistance,
24 including, but not limited to, the vision card, EBT card and Kansas
25 benefits card.
26 (e)(i) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys
27 or state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted
28 a medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both
29 are expended, medical assistance in accordance with such plan shall be
30 granted to any person who is a citizen of the United States or who is an
31 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
32 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
33 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
34 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
35 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
36 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
37 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
38 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to
39 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
40 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
41 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.
42 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
43 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint
HB 2027 22
1 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
2 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
3 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
4 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
5 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
6 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
7 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
8 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
9 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
10 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
11 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
12 of the legislature.
13 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
14 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
15 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
16 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
17 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
18 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
19 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
20 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
21 shall be considered an available resource unless:
22 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
23 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
24 (ii) the trust is funded:
25 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
26 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
27 or
28 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that
29 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
30 assistance.
31 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
32 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
33 security act.
34 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
35 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
36 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
37 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
38 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,
39 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
40 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
41 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available
42 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
43 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed
HB 2027 23
1 prior to any services being provided;
2 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
3 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
4 nonlicensed individuals;
5 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
6 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
7 wage standards;
8 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
9 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
10 revenue agencies;
11 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
12 be paid after the services are rendered;
13 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
14 contract, agreement or accord; and
15 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
16 agreement or accord ceases.
17 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
18 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
19 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
20 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
21 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
22 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
23 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
24 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
25 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
26 Kansas uniform trust code.
27 (f)(j) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
28 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-
29 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
30 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
31 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
32 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
33 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
34 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
35 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
36 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
37 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
38 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the
39 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
40 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
41 outside the state voluntarily.
42 (g)(k) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support
43 and limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased
HB 2027 24
1 recipients. (1) (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-
2 787, and amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after
3 September 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare
4 catastrophic coverage act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for
5 or receiving medical assistance under a medical care plan in which federal
6 funds are expended, any accrued, present or future rights to support and
7 any rights to payment for medical care from a third party of an applicant or
8 recipient and any other family member for whom the applicant is applying
9 shall be deemed to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the
10 state. The assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date
11 of approval for such assistance without the requirement that any document
12 be signed by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving
13 medical assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have
14 appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact
15 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
16 money orders or other negotiable instruments, representing payments
17 received by the secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving
18 or having received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be
19 effective from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance
20 and shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full.
21 The assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third
22 party under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from
23 directly billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider
24 has not submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for
25 payment. Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to
26 support are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no
27 other shall be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments
28 thereto, except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be
29 retained by the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of
30 assistance. Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to
31 payment for medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the
32 secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
33 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
34 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
35 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
36 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
37 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
38 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes
39 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
40 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
41 under the provisions of subsection (e) (i) is a claim against the property or
42 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
43 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,
HB 2027 25
1 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
2 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
3 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
4 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
5 individual under subsection (e) (i) except after the death of the surviving
6 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
7 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
8 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
9 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
10 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
11 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
12 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e)
13 (i) is a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
14 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
15 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
16 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
17 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
18 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
19 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
20 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
21 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
22 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
23 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
24 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
25 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery
26 program under this subsection.
27 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
28 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
29 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
30 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
31 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
32 the results therefrom:
33 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
34 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
35 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
36 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
37 defined by applicable law; and
38 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,
39 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
40 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
41 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance
42 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
43 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had
HB 2027 26
1 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
2 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
3 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
4 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
5 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
6 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
7 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
8 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
9 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
10 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
11 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
12 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
13 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
14 the county subject to the lien.
15 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
16 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
17 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
18 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
19 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
20 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
21 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
22 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
23 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
24 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
25 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall
26 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
27 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
28 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or
29 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
30 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
31 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
32 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
33 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
34 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
35 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
36 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
37 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
38 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
39 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
40 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
41 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to
42 dissolution of the lien.
43 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the
HB 2027 27
1 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
2 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
3 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
4 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
5 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
6 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
7 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
8 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
9 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
10 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
11 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
12 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
13 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
14 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
15 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
16 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
17 following events occur:
18 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
19 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
20 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
21 environment or the secretary's designee;
22 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
23 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
24 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
25 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee
26 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
27 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
28 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed
29 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
30 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
31 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
32 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
33 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
34 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
35 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
36 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
37 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
38 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's
39 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
40 designee.
41 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and
42 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
43 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of
HB 2027 28
1 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
2 nullified pursuant to law.
3 (h) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children or
4 revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
5 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
6 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
7 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
8 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
9 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
10 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
11 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
12 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
13 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
14 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
15 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
16 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
17 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
18 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
19 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
20 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
21 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
22 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
23 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
24 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
25 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
26 (i) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired from
27 employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and regulations
28 of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a felony
29 conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or parole
30 imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
31 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
32 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
33 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
34 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
35 (j) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
36 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
37 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
38 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
39 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
40 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
41 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate
42 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
43 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
HB 2027 29
1 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
2 (k) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance,
3 the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned, pursuant to
4 K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on behalf of the
5 state only accrued, present or future rights to support from any other
6 person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of
7 any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or
8 receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically become
9 effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid without the
10 requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or recipient. By
11 applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance, the
12 applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
13 secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
14 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
15 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
16 secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
17 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
18 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
19 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
20 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
21 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
22 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
23 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
24 (l) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash assistance
25 as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons receiving cash
26 assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash assistance shall be
27 established, subject to applicable federal law, by the secretary for children
28 and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under such program of drug
29 screening, the secretary for children and families shall order a drug
30 screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash assistance at any time
31 when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant for or recipient of
32 cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled
33 substance analog. The secretary for children and families may use any
34 information obtained by the secretary for children and families to
35 determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not
36 limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed appointments and
37 arrest or other police records, previous employment or application for
38 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug
39 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a
40 controlled substance or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening
41 records of the applicant or recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled
42 substance or controlled substance analog.
43 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
HB 2027 30
1 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
2 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
3 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
4 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
5 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
6 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
7 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
8 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
9 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
10 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
11 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
12 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
13 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
14 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
15 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
16 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
17 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
18 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
19 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
20 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
21 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
22 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
23 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
24 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
25 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills
26 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
27 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
28 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third
29 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
30 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
31 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
32 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
33 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
34 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
35 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
36 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
37 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
38 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual
39 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
40 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
41 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for
42 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
43 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or
HB 2027 31
1 controlled substance analog.
2 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
3 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
4 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
5 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
6 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
7 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
8 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
9 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
10 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
11 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
12 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
13 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
14 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
15 controlled substance analog.
16 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
17 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
18 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
19 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
20 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
21 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
22 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
23 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
24 of such additional drug screening.
25 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
26 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
27 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
28 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for
29 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
30 or legal guardian's minor child.
31 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
32 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
33 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
34 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog,
35 and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall
36 thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance under this
37 subsection unless such conviction is the person's first conviction. First-
38 time offenders convicted under federal or state law of any offense that is
39 classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has as an element
40 of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution, possession or
41 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and the date
42 of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall become
43 ineligible to receive cash assistance for five years from the date of
HB 2027 32
1 conviction.
2 (6) Except for hearings before the Kansas department for children and
3 families, the results of any drug screening administered as part of the drug
4 screening program authorized by this subsection shall be confidential and
5 shall not be disclosed publicly.
6 (7) The secretary for children and families may adopt such rules and
7 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
8 (8) Any authority granted to the secretary for children and families
9 under this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed
10 by law.
11 (9) As used in this subsection:
12 (A) "Cash assistance" means cash assistance provided to individuals
13 under the provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes
14 Annotated, and amendments thereto, and any rules and regulations adopted
15 pursuant to such provisions.

17 amendments thereto, and 21 U.S.C. § 802.
18 (C) "Controlled substance analog" means the same as in K.S.A. 21-

31 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
32 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
33 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
34 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the
35 cost of such additional drug screening.
36 (D) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
37 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
38 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
39 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary to
40 receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's or legal guardian's
41 minor child.
42 (3) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
43 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has

HB 2027 18
1 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
2 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
3 analog, and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person
4 shall thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance
5 under this subsection unless such conviction is the person's first
6 conviction. First-time offenders convicted under federal or state law of
7 any offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and
8 has as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation,
9 distribution, possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled
10 substance analog, and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013,
11 such person shall become ineligible to receive cash assistance for five
12 years from the date of conviction.
13 (4) (A) Food assistance shall not be provided to any person convicted
14 of a felony offense occurring on or after July 1, 2015, that includes as an
15 element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
16 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
17 analog. For food assistance, the individual shall be permanently
18 disqualified if such individual has been convicted of a state or federal
19 felony offense occurring on or after July 1, 2015, involving possession or
20 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
21 (B) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), an
22 individual shall be eligible for food assistance if the individual enrolls in
23 and participates in a drug treatment program approved by the secretary,
24 submits to and passes a drug test and agrees to submit to drug testing if
25 requested by the department pursuant to a drug testing plan.
26 (ii) An individual's failure to submit to testing or failure to
27 successfully pass a drug test shall result in ineligibility for food assistance
28 until a drug test is successfully passed.
29 (iii) Failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program shall
30 result in ineligibility for food assistance until a drug treatment plan
31 approved by the secretary is successfully completed, the individual passes
32 a drug test and agrees to submit to drug testing if requested by the
33 department pursuant to a drug testing plan.
34 (C) The provisions of subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any
35 individual who has been convicted for a second or subsequent felony
36 offense as provided in subparagraph (A).
37 (5) The secretary may adopt such rules and regulations as are
38 necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
39 (6) Any authority granted to the secretary under this subsection shall
40 be in addition to any other penalties prescribed by law.
41 (7) As used in this subsection:
42 (A) "Cash assistance" means cash assistance provided to individuals
43 under the provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes

HB 2027 19
1 Annotated, and amendments thereto, and any rules and regulations
2 adopted pursuant to such provisions.
3 (B) "Controlled substance" means the same as defined in K.S.A. 21-
4 5701, and amendments thereto, and 21 U.S.C. § 802.
5 (C) "Controlled substance analog" means the same as defined in
6 K.S.A. 21-5701, and amendments thereto.
7 (d) Temporary assistance for needy families;
8 (g) Assignment of support rights and limited power of attorney. (1)
9 By applying for or receiving temporary assistance for needy families such
10 applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned to the secretary on
11 behalf of the state any accrued, present or future rights to support from any
12 other person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in
13 behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for
14 or receiving aid. In any case in which an order for child support has been
15 established and the legal custodian and obligee under the order surrenders
16 physical custody of the child to a caretaker relative without obtaining a
17 modification of legal custody and support rights on behalf of the child are
18 assigned pursuant to this section, the surrender of physical custody and the
19 assignment shall transfer, by operation of law, the child's support rights
20 under the order to the secretary on behalf of the state. Such assignment
21 shall be of all accrued, present or future rights to support of the child
22 surrendered to the caretaker relative. The assignment of support rights
23 shall automatically become effective upon the date of approval for or
24 receipt of such aid without the requirement that any document be signed
25 by the applicant, recipient or obligee. By applying for or receiving
26 temporary assistance for needy families, or by surrendering physical
27 custody of a child to a caretaker relative who is an applicant or recipient of
28 such assistance on the child's behalf, the applicant, recipient or obligee is
29 also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as
30 an attorney-in-fact to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing
31 all drafts, checks, money orders or other negotiable instruments
32 representing support payments received by the secretary in behalf of any
33 person applying for, receiving or having received such assistance. This
34 limited power of attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary
35 approves the application for aid and shall remain in effect until the
36 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
37 (2) If the applicant or recipient of TANF is a mother of the dependent
38 child, as a condition of the mother's eligibility for TANF, the mother shall
39 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
40 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
41 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
42 recipient of TANF who fails to cooperate with requirements relating to
43 child support services under criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules

HB 2027 20
1 and regulations of the secretary shall be subject to a penalty established
2 by the secretary.
3 (3) In any case in which the secretary pays for the expenses of care
4 and custody of a child pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et
5 seq., and amendments thereto, including the expenses of any foster care
6 placement, an assignment of all past, present and future support rights of
7 the child in custody possessed by either parent or other person entitled to
8 receive support payments for the child is, by operation of law, conveyed to
9 the secretary. Such assignment shall become effective upon placement of a
10 child in the custody of the secretary or upon payment of the expenses of
11 care and custody of a child by the secretary without the requirement that
12 any document be signed by the parent or other person entitled to receive
13 support payments for the child. When the secretary pays for the expenses
14 of care and custody of a child or a child is placed in the custody of the
15 secretary, the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments
16 for the child is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
17 secretary's designee, as attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
18 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
19 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
20 secretary on behalf of the child. This limited power of attorney shall be
21 effective from the date the assignment to support rights becomes effective
22 and shall remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been
23 terminated in full.
24 (4) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food
25 assistance, the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned,
26 pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on
27 behalf of the state only accrued, present or future rights to support from
28 any other person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or
29 in behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying
30 for or receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically
31 become effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid
32 without the requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or
33 recipient. By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food
34 assistance, the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
35 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the
36 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
37 or other negotiable instruments representing support payments received by
38 the secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
39 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
40 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
41 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
42 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
43 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and

HB 2027 21
1 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
2 or recipients of TANF.
3 (h) Electronic benefits card. (1) The secretary shall place a
4 photograph of the recipient, if agreed to by such recipient of public
5 assistance, on any Kansas benefits card issued by the Kansas department
6 for children and families that the recipient uses in obtaining food, cash or
7 any other services. When a recipient of public assistance is a minor or
8 otherwise incapacitated individual, a parent or legal guardian of such
9 recipient may have a photograph of such parent or legal guardian placed
10 on the card.
11 (2) Any Kansas benefits card with a photograph of a recipient shall
12 be valid for voting purposes as a public assistance identification card in
13 accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments
14 thereto.
15 (3) The Kansas department for children and families shall monitor
16 all recipient requests for a Kansas benefits card replacement and, upon
17 the fourth such request in a 12-month period, send a notice alerting the
18 recipient that the recipient's account is being monitored for potential
19 suspicious activity. If a recipient makes an additional request for
20 replacement subsequent to such notice, the department shall refer the
21 investigation to the department's fraud investigation unit.
22 (4) As used in this subsection, "Kansas benefits card" means any card
23 issued to provide food assistance, cash assistance or child care assistance,
24 including, but not limited to, the vision card, EBT card and Kansas
25 benefits card.
26 (e)(i) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys
27 or state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted
28 a medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both
29 are expended, medical assistance in accordance with such plan shall be
30 granted to any person who is a citizen of the United States or who is an
31 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
32 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
33 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
34 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
35 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
36 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
37 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
38 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to
39 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
40 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
41 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.
42 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
43 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint

HB 2027 22
1 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
2 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
3 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
4 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
5 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
6 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
7 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
8 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
9 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
10 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
11 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
12 of the legislature.
13 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
14 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
15 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
16 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
17 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
18 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
19 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
20 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
21 shall be considered an available resource unless:
22 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
23 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
24 (ii) the trust is funded:
25 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
26 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
27 or
28 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that
29 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
30 assistance.
31 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
32 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
33 security act.
34 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
35 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
36 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
37 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
38 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,
39 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
40 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
41 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available
42 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
43 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed

HB 2027 23
1 prior to any services being provided;
2 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
3 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
4 nonlicensed individuals;
5 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
6 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
7 wage standards;
8 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
9 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
10 revenue agencies;
11 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
12 be paid after the services are rendered;
13 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
14 contract, agreement or accord; and
15 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
16 agreement or accord ceases.
17 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
18 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
19 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
20 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
21 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
22 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
23 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
24 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
25 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
26 Kansas uniform trust code.
27 (f)(j) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
28 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-
29 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
30 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
31 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
32 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
33 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
34 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
35 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
36 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
37 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
38 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the
39 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
40 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
41 outside the state voluntarily.
42 (g)(k) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support
43 and limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased

HB 2027 24
1 recipients. (1) (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-
2 787, and amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after
3 September 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare
4 catastrophic coverage act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for
5 or receiving medical assistance under a medical care plan in which federal
6 funds are expended, any accrued, present or future rights to support and
7 any rights to payment for medical care from a third party of an applicant or
8 recipient and any other family member for whom the applicant is applying
9 shall be deemed to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the
10 state. The assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date
11 of approval for such assistance without the requirement that any document
12 be signed by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving
13 medical assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have
14 appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact
15 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
16 money orders or other negotiable instruments, representing payments
17 received by the secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving
18 or having received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be
19 effective from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance
20 and shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full.
21 The assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third
22 party under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from
23 directly billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider
24 has not submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for
25 payment. Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to
26 support are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no
27 other shall be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments
28 thereto, except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be
29 retained by the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of
30 assistance. Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to
31 payment for medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the
32 secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
33 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
34 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
35 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
36 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
37 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
38 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes
39 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
40 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
41 under the provisions of subsection (e) (i) is a claim against the property or
42 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
43 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,

HB 2027 25
1 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
2 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
3 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
4 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
5 individual under subsection (e) (i) except after the death of the surviving
6 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
7 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
8 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
9 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
10 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
11 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
12 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e)
13 (i) is a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
14 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
15 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
16 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
17 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
18 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
19 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
20 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
21 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
22 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
23 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
24 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
25 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery
26 program under this subsection.
27 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
28 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
29 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
30 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
31 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
32 the results therefrom:
33 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
34 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
35 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
36 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
37 defined by applicable law; and
38 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,
39 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
40 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
41 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance
42 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
43 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had

HB 2027 26
1 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
2 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
3 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
4 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
5 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
6 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
7 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
8 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
9 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
10 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
11 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
12 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
13 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
14 the county subject to the lien.
15 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
16 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
17 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
18 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
19 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
20 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
21 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
22 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
23 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
24 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
25 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall
26 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
27 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
28 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or
29 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
30 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
31 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
32 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
33 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
34 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
35 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
36 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
37 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
38 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
39 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
40 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
41 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to
42 dissolution of the lien.
43 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the

HB 2027 27
1 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
2 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
3 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
4 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
5 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
6 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
7 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
8 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
9 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
10 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
11 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
12 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
13 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
14 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
15 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
16 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
17 following events occur:
18 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
19 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
20 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
21 environment or the secretary's designee;
22 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
23 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
24 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
25 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee
26 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
27 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
28 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed
29 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
30 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
31 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
32 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
33 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
34 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
35 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
36 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
37 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
38 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's
39 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
40 designee.
41 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and
42 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
43 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of

HB 2027 28
1 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
2 nullified pursuant to law.
3 (h) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children or
4 revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
5 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
6 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
7 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
8 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
9 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
10 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
11 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
12 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
13 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
14 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
15 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
16 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
17 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
18 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
19 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
20 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
21 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
22 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
23 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
24 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
25 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
26 (i) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired from
27 employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and regulations
28 of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a felony
29 conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or parole
30 imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
31 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
32 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
33 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
34 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
35 (j) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
36 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
37 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
38 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
39 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
40 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
41 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate
42 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
43 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be

HB 2027 29
1 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
2 (k) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance,
3 the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned, pursuant to
4 K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on behalf of the
5 state only accrued, present or future rights to support from any other
6 person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of
7 any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or
8 receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically become
9 effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid without the
10 requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or recipient. By
11 applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance, the
12 applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
13 secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
14 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
15 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
16 secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
17 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
18 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
19 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
20 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
21 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
22 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
23 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
24 (l) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash assistance
25 as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons receiving cash
26 assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash assistance shall be
27 established, subject to applicable federal law, by the secretary for children
28 and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under such program of drug
29 screening, the secretary for children and families shall order a drug
30 screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash assistance at any time
31 when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant for or recipient of
32 cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled
33 substance analog. The secretary for children and families may use any
34 information obtained by the secretary for children and families to
35 determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not
36 limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed appointments and
37 arrest or other police records, previous employment or application for
38 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug
39 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a
40 controlled substance or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening
41 records of the applicant or recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled
42 substance or controlled substance analog.
43 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug

HB 2027 30
1 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
2 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
3 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
4 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
5 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
6 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
7 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
8 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
9 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
10 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
11 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
12 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
13 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
14 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
15 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
16 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
17 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
18 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
19 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
20 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
21 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
22 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
23 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
24 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
25 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills
26 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
27 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
28 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third
29 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
30 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
31 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
32 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
33 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
34 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
35 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
36 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
37 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
38 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual
39 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
40 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
41 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for
42 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
43 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or

HB 2027 31
1 controlled substance analog.
2 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
3 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
4 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
5 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
6 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
7 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
8 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
9 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
10 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
11 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
12 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
13 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
14 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
15 controlled substance analog.
16 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
17 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
18 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
19 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
20 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
21 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
22 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
23 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
24 of such additional drug screening.
25 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
26 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
27 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
28 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for
29 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
30 or legal guardian's minor child.
31 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
32 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
33 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
34 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog,
35 and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall
36 thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance under this
37 subsection unless such conviction is the person's first conviction. First-
38 time offenders convicted under federal or state law of any offense that is
39 classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has as an element
40 of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution, possession or
41 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and the date
42 of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall become
43 ineligible to receive cash assistance for five years from the date of

HB 2027 32
1 conviction.
2 (6) Except for hearings before the Kansas department for children and
3 families, the results of any drug screening administered as part of the drug
4 screening program authorized by this subsection shall be confidential and
5 shall not be disclosed publicly.
6 (7) The secretary for children and families may adopt such rules and
7 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
8 (8) Any authority granted to the secretary for children and families
9 under this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed
10 by law.
11 (9) As used in this subsection:
12 (A) "Cash assistance" means cash assistance provided to individuals
13 under the provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes
14 Annotated, and amendments thereto, and any rules and regulations adopted
