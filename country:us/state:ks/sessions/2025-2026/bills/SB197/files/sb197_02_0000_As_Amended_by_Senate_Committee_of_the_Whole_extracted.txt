32 (2) Except as provided in subsection (b)(3), before the governing
33 body of any city proposes to issue full faith and credit tax increment bonds
34 as authorized by this subsection, the feasibility study required by K.S.A.
35 12-17,166(b), and amendments thereto, shall demonstrate that the benefits
36 derived from the project will exceed the cost and that the income
37 therefrom will be sufficient to pay the costs of the project. No full faith
38 and credit tax increment bonds shall be issued unless the governing body
39 states in the resolution required by K.S.A. 12-17,166(e), and amendments
40 thereto, that it may issue such bonds to finance the proposed STAR bond
41 project. The governing body may issue the bonds unless within 60 days

3 filed, no full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall be issued until the
4 issuance of the bonds is approved by a majority of the voters voting at an
5 election thereon. Such election shall be called and held in the manner
6 provided by the general bond law. The failure of the voters to approve the
7 issuance of full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall not prevent the
8 city from issuing special obligation bonds in accordance with this section.
9 No such election shall be held in the event the board of county
10 commissioners or the board of education determines, as provided in
11 K.S.A. 12-17,165, and amendments thereto, that the proposed STAR bond
12 project district will have an adverse effect on the county or school district.
13 (3) As an alternative to subsection (b)(2), any city which adopts a
14 STAR bond project plan for a major motorsports complex, but does not
15 state its intent to issue full faith and credit tax increment bonds in the
16 resolution required by K.S.A. 12-17,166(e), and amendments thereto, and
17 has not acquired property in the STAR bond project area may issue full
18 faith and credit tax increment bonds if the governing body of the city
19 adopts a resolution stating its intent to issue the bonds and the issuance of
20 the bonds is approved by a majority of the voters voting at an election
21 thereon. Such election shall be called and held in the manner provided by
22 the general bond law. The failure of the voters to approve the issuance of
23 full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall not prevent the city from
24 issuing special obligation bonds pursuant to subsection (a)(1). Any project
25 plan adopted by a city prior to the effective date of this act in accordance
26 with K.S.A. 12-1772, and amendments thereto, shall not be invalidated by
27 any requirements of this act.

32 amendments thereto, to pay the project costs for the major motorsports
33 complex project. Such temporary notes shall not be issued and the city
34 shall not acquire property in the STAR bond project area until the
35 requirements of subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3), whichever is applicable, have
36 been met.
37 (5) Full faith and credit tax increment bonds issued under this
38 subsection shall be general obligations of the city and are declared to be
39 negotiable instruments. Such bonds shall be issued in accordance with the

31 the event all other authorized sources of revenue are not sufficient.
32 (2) Except as provided in subsection (b)(3), before the governing
33 body of any city proposes to issue full faith and credit tax increment bonds
34 as authorized by this subsection, the feasibility study required by K.S.A.

36 derived from the project will exceed the cost and that the income
37 therefrom will be sufficient to pay the costs of the project. No full faith
38 and credit tax increment bonds shall be issued unless the governing body
39 states in the resolution required by K.S.A. 12-17,166(e), and amendments
40 thereto, that it may issue such bonds to finance the proposed STAR bond
41 project. The governing body may issue the bonds unless within 60 days

6 provided by the general bond law. The failure of the voters to approve the
7 issuance of full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall not prevent the
8 city from issuing special obligation bonds in accordance with this section.
9 No such election shall be held in the event the board of county
10 commissioners or the board of education determines, as provided in
11 K.S.A. 12-17,165, and amendments thereto, that the proposed STAR bond
12 project district will have an adverse effect on the county or school district.
13 (3) As an alternative to subsection (b)(2), any city which adopts a

16 resolution required by K.S.A. 12-17,166(e), and amendments thereto, and
17 has not acquired property in the STAR bond project area may issue full
18 faith and credit tax increment bonds if the governing body of the city
19 adopts a resolution stating its intent to issue the bonds and the issuance of
20 the bonds is approved by a majority of the voters voting at an election
21 thereon. Such election shall be called and held in the manner provided by
22 the general bond law. The failure of the voters to approve the issuance of
23 full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall not prevent the city from
24 issuing special obligation bonds pursuant to subsection (a)(1). Any project
25 plan adopted by a city prior to the effective date of this act in accordance
26 with K.S.A. 12-1772, and amendments thereto, shall not be invalidated by

35 requirements of subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3), whichever is applicable, have
36 been met.
37 (5) Full faith and credit tax increment bonds issued under this
38 subsection shall be general obligations of the city and are declared to be
39 negotiable instruments. Such bonds shall be issued in accordance with the
40 general bond law. All such bonds and all income or interest therefrom shall
41 be exempt from all state taxes. The amount of the full faith and credit tax
42 increment bonds issued and outstanding which exceeds 3% of the assessed
43 valuation of the city shall be within the bonded debt limit applicable to

SB 197—Am. by SCW 21
1 such city.
2 (6) Any city issuing full faith and credit tax increment bonds under
3 the provisions of this subsection may refund all or part of such issue
