24 (2) Except as provided in subsection (b)(3), before the governing
25 body of any city proposes to issue full faith and credit tax increment bonds
26 as authorized by this subsection, the feasibility study required by K.S.A.
27 12-17,166(b), and amendments thereto, shall demonstrate that the benefits
28 derived from the project will exceed the cost and that the income
29 therefrom will be sufficient to pay the costs of the project. No full faith
30 and credit tax increment bonds shall be issued unless the governing body
31 states in the resolution required by K.S.A. 12-17,166(e), and amendments
32 thereto, that it may issue such bonds to finance the proposed STAR bond
33 project. The governing body may issue the bonds unless within 60 days

39 issuance of the bonds is approved by a majority of the voters voting at an
40 election thereon. Such election shall be called and held in the manner
41 provided by the general bond law. The failure of the voters to approve the
42 issuance of full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall not prevent the
43 city from issuing special obligation bonds in accordance with this section.

Sub SB 197 20
1 No such election shall be held in the event the board of county
2 commissioners or the board of education determines, as provided in
3 K.S.A. 12-17,165, and amendments thereto, that the proposed STAR bond
4 project district will have an adverse effect on the county or school district.

7 state its intent to issue full faith and credit tax increment bonds in the
8 resolution required by K.S.A. 12-17,166(e), and amendments thereto, and
9 has not acquired property in the STAR bond project area may issue full
10 faith and credit tax increment bonds if the governing body of the city
11 adopts a resolution stating its intent to issue the bonds and the issuance of
12 the bonds is approved by a majority of the voters voting at an election
13 thereon. Such election shall be called and held in the manner provided by
14 the general bond law. The failure of the voters to approve the issuance of
15 full faith and credit tax increment bonds shall not prevent the city from
16 issuing special obligation bonds pursuant to subsection (a)(1). Any project
17 plan adopted by a city prior to the effective date of this act in accordance
18 with K.S.A. 12-1772, and amendments thereto, shall not be invalidated by
19 any requirements of this act.

25 complex project. Such temporary notes shall not be issued and the city
26 shall not acquire property in the STAR bond project area until the
27 requirements of subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3), whichever is applicable, have
28 been met.
29 (5) Full faith and credit tax increment bonds issued under this
30 subsection shall be general obligations of the city and are declared to be
31 negotiable instruments. Such bonds shall be issued in accordance with the
32 general bond law. All such bonds and all income or interest therefrom shall
33 be exempt from all state taxes. The amount of the full faith and credit tax
34 increment bonds issued and outstanding which exceeds 3% of the assessed
35 valuation of the city shall be within the bonded debt limit applicable to
36 such city.
37 (6) Any city issuing full faith and credit tax increment bonds under
38 the provisions of this subsection may refund all or part of such issue
39 pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 10-116a, and amendments thereto.
40 (c) (1) For each project established by a city or county financed with
41 special obligation bonds payable from the revenues described in
42 subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2), the city or county shall prepare and submit to
43 the secretary by October 1 of each year, a report describing the status of
