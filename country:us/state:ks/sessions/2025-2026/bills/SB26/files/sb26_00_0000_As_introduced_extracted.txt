27 tangible personal property or services purchased by a contractor for the
28 purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing, maintaining, repairing,
29 enlarging, furnishing or remodeling facilities for any political subdivision

31 paid from funds of such political subdivision or district and that would be
32 exempt from taxation under the provisions of this act if purchased directly
33 by such political subdivision or district. Nothing in this subsection or in
34 the provisions of K.S.A. 12-3418, and amendments thereto, shall be

16 institution or department of corrections concerned a sworn statement, on a
17 form to be provided by the director of taxation, that all purchases so made
18 were entitled to exemption under this subsection. As an alternative to the
19 foregoing procedure, any such contracting entity may apply to the
20 secretary of revenue for agent status for the sole purpose of issuing and
21 furnishing project exemption certificates to contractors pursuant to rules
22 and regulations adopted by the secretary establishing conditions and
23 standards for the granting and maintaining of such status. All invoices
24 shall be held by the contractor for a period of five years and shall be
25 subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any materials purchased
26 under such a certificate are found not to have been incorporated in the
27 building or other project or not to have been returned for credit or the sales
