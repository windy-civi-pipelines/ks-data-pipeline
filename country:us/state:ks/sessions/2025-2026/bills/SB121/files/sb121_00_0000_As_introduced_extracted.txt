27 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
28 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
29 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
30 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
31 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
32 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
33 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
34 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
35 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
36 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
37 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
38 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
39 framework for that data year.
40 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
41 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
42 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
43 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
SB 121 12
1 determination for an insurer.
2 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
3 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
4 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
5 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
6 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
7 framework.
8 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
9 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
10 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
11 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
12 insurer, as applicable.
13 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
14 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
15 shall be subject to the following standards:
16 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
17 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
18 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
19 commissioner of insurance;
20 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
21 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
22 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
23 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
24 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
25 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
26 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
27 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
28 to the respective parties; and
29 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
30 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
31 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
32 to its financial needs.
33 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
34 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
35 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
36 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
37 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
38 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
39 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
40 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
41 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
42 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
43 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
SB 121 13
1 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
2 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
3 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
4 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
5 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
6 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
7 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
8 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
9 only with a specific person;
10 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
11 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
12 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
13 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
14 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
15 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
16 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
17 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
18 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
19 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
20 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
21 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
22 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
23 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
24 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
25 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
26 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
27 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
28 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
29 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
30 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
31 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
32 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
33 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
34 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
35 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
36 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
37 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
38 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
39 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
40 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
41 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
42 such period.
43 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
SB 121 14
1 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
2 exceed:
3 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
4 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
5 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
6 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
7 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
8 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
9 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
10 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
11 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
12 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
13 transactions are equal to or exceed:
14 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
15 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
16 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
17 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
18 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
19 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
20 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
21 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
22 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
23 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
24 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
25 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
26 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
27 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
28 more affiliates of the insurer;
29 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
30 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
31 (5) any material transactions, specified by rules and regulations,
32 which that the commissioner of insurance determines may adversely affect
33 the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
34 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
35 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
36 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
37 otherwise contrary to law.
38 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
39 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
40 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
41 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
42 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner
43 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into
SB 121 15
1 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
2 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
3 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
4 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
5 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
6 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
7 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
8 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
9 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
10 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
11 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
12 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
13 be subject to the requirements of this section.
14 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
15 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
16 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
17 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
18 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
19 payment; or
20 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
21 such 30-day period.
22 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
23 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
24 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
25 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
26 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
27 December 31 immediately preceding; or
28 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
29 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
30 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
31 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
32 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
33 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
34 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
35 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
36 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
37 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
38 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
39 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
40 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
41 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
42 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
43 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
SB 121 16
1 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
2 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
3 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
4 accordance with this section.
5 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
6 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
7 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
8 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
9 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
10 such dividend or distribution; or
11 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
12 within the 30-day period referred to above.
13 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
14 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
15 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
16 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
17 operating identity consistent with this act.
18 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
19 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
20 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
21 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
22 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
23 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
24 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
25 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
26 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
27 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
28 other appropriate criteria;
29 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
30 several lines of insurance;
31 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
32 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
33 risks;
34 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
35 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
36 portfolio;
37 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
38 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
39 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
40 comparable insurers;
41 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
42 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
43 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
SB 121 17
1 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
2 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
3 such investment so warrants; and
4 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
5 reported earnings include extraordinary items.

17 basis.
18 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
19 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
20 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
21 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
22 act.
23 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
24 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
25 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
26 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
27 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
28 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
29 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
30 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
31 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
32 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
33 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,

35 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
36 insurer.

5 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
6 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
7 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
8 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance
9 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
10 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
11 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
12 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
13 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
14 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
15 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
16 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
17 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
18 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
19 examined.

35 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
36 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the
37 provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act, determines that the
38 interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public would be served by

17 changes from the prior registration statement.
18 (d) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement
19 filed pursuant to subsection (b) if such information is not material for the
20 purpose of this section. Unless the commissioner of insurance by rules and
21 regulations or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans
22 or extensions of credit, investments or guarantees, involving 0.5% or less
23 of an insurer's admitted assets as of the December 31 immediately next
24 preceding shall be deemed immaterial for purposes of this section.
25 (e) Each registered insurer shall keep current the information required
26 to be disclosed in such insurer's registration statement by reporting all
27 material changes or additions on amendment forms provided by the
28 commissioner of insurance within 15 days after the end of the month in
29 which it learns of each such change or addition, except that each registered
30 insurer shall report all dividends and other distributions to shareholders
31 within five business days following its declaration. Any such dividend or
32 distribution shall not be paid for at least 10 business days from the
33 commissioner's receipt of the notice of its declaration.
34 (f) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject
35 to registration shall provide complete and accurate information to an
36 insurer, where if such information is reasonably necessary to enable the
37 insurer to comply with the provisions of this act.
38 (g) The commissioner of insurance shall terminate the registration of
39 any insurer that demonstrates that such insurer is no longer is a member of
40 an insurance holding company system.
41 (h) The commissioner of insurance may require or allow two or more
42 affiliated insurers subject to registration hereunder to file a consolidated
43 registration statement.

SB 121 9
1 (i) The commissioner of insurance may allow an insurer that is
2 authorized to do business in this state and that is part of an insurance
3 holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer that
4 is required to register under subsection (a) and to file all information and
5 material required to be filed under this section.
6 (j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any information or
7 transaction if and to the extent the commissioner of insurance by rule and
8 regulation or order exempts the same from the provisions of this section.
9 (k) Any person may file with the commissioner of insurance a
10 disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer or such a disclaimer
11 may be filed by such insurer or any member of an insurance holding
12 company system. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material
13 relationships and bases for affiliation between such person and such
14 insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation. After a
15 disclaimer has been filed, the insurer shall be relieved of any duty to
16 register or report under this section which that may arise out of the
17 insurer's relationship with such person unless and until the commissioner
18 of insurance disallows such a disclaimer. The commissioner of insurance
19 shall disallow such a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest
20 with notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the provisions
21 of the Kansas administrative procedure act.
22 (l) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the ultimate controlling
23 person of every insurer subject to registration also shall file an annual
24 enterprise risk report. The report, to the best of the ultimate controlling
25 person's knowledge and belief, shall identify the material risks within the
26 insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the
27 insurer. The report shall be appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity
28 of the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of
29 insurance of the insurance holding company system as determined by the
30 procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the national
31 association of insurance commissioners NAIC. The first enterprise risk
32 report shall be filed no not later than May 1, 2015, and annually thereafter
33 by May 1 of each year unless the commissioner of insurance extends the
34 time for filing for good cause shown.
35 (2) The ultimate controlling person of a domestic insurer that is
36 authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business of insurance only
37 in this state with total direct and assumed annual premiums of less than
38 $300 million is not required to submit an enterprise risk report under
39 paragraph (1) unless the ultimate controlling person of the domestic
40 insurer also controls other insurers that do not meet the requirements of
41 this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, an insurer is not
42 considered to be authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business
43 of insurance only in this state if the insurer directly or indirectly writes or

SB 121 10
1 assumes insurance in any other manner in another state(A) Except as
2 provided hereunder, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer
3 subject to registration shall concurrently file with the registration an
4 annual group capital calculation as directed by the lead state
5 commissioner. The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC
6 group capital calculation instructions, which may permit the lead state
7 commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate
8 controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The report shall be
9 filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company
10 system as determined by the commissioner of insurance in accordance
11 with the procedures within the financial analysis handbook. An insurance
12 holding company system shall be exempt from filing the group capital
13 calculation if:
14 (i) It has only one insurer within its holding company structure, only
15 writes business is only licensed in its domestic state and assumes no
16 business from any other insurer;
17 (ii) it is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by
18 the board of governors of the federal reserve system. The lead state
19 commissioner shall request the calculation from the federal reserve board
20 under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. If the federal
21 reserve board cannot share the calculation with the lead state
22 commissioner, the insurance holding company shall not be exempt from
23 the group capital calculation filing;
24 (iii) its non-United States group-wide supervisor is located within a
25 reciprocal jurisdiction, as defined in K.S.A. 40-221a, and amendments
26 thereto, that recognizes the United States regulatory approach to group
27 supervision and group capital; and
28 (iv) it is an insurance holding company system:
29 (a) That provides information to the lead state that meets the
30 requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and
31 accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide
32 supervisor, who has determined that such information is satisfactory to
33 allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach,
34 as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis handbook; and
35 (b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in a
36 reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
37 commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
38 the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
39 groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
40 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
41 amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
42 capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United
43 States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary

SB 121 11
1 consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate
2 by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency
3 monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance
4 marketplace.
5 (C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital
6 calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead
7 state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling
8 person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a
9 limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria specified
10 by the commissioner in regulation.
11 (D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
12 holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements
13 for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this
14 section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital
15 calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the
16 lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.
17 (E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
18 registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
19 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall
20 be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding
21 company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
22 analysis handbook and that:
23 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
24 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
25 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
26 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
27 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
28 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
29 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
30 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
31 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
32 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
33 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
34 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
35 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
36 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
37 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
38 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
39 framework for that data year.
40 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
41 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
42 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
43 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the

SB 121 12
1 determination for an insurer.
2 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
3 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
4 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
5 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
6 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
7 framework.
8 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
9 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
10 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
11 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
12 insurer, as applicable.
13 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
14 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
15 shall be subject to the following standards:
16 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
17 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
18 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
19 commissioner of insurance;
20 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
21 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
22 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
23 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
24 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
25 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
26 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
27 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
28 to the respective parties; and
29 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
30 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
31 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
32 to its financial needs.
33 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
34 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
35 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
36 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
37 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
38 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
39 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
40 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
41 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
42 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
43 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the

SB 121 13
1 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
2 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
3 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
4 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
5 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
6 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
7 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
8 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
9 only with a specific person;
10 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
11 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
12 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
13 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
14 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
15 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
16 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
17 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
18 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
19 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
20 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
21 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
22 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
23 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
24 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
25 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
26 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
27 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
28 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
29 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
30 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
31 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
32 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
33 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
34 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
35 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
36 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
37 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
38 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
39 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
40 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
41 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
42 such period.
43 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,

SB 121 14
1 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
2 exceed:
3 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
4 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
5 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
6 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
7 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
8 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
9 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
10 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
11 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
12 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
13 transactions are equal to or exceed:
14 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
15 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
16 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
17 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
18 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
19 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
20 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
21 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
22 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
23 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
24 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
25 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
26 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
27 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
28 more affiliates of the insurer;
29 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
30 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
31 (5) any material transactions, specified by rules and regulations,
32 which that the commissioner of insurance determines may adversely affect
33 the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
34 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
35 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
36 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
37 otherwise contrary to law.
38 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
39 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
40 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
41 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
42 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner
43 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into

SB 121 15
1 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
2 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
3 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
4 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
5 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
6 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
7 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
8 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
9 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
10 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
11 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
12 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
13 be subject to the requirements of this section.
14 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
15 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
16 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
17 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
18 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
19 payment; or
20 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
21 such 30-day period.
22 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
23 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
24 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
25 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
26 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
27 December 31 immediately preceding; or
28 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
29 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
30 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
31 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
32 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
33 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
34 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
35 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
36 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
37 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
38 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
39 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
40 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
41 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
42 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
43 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and

SB 121 16
1 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
2 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
3 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
4 accordance with this section.
5 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
6 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
7 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
8 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
9 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
10 such dividend or distribution; or
11 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
12 within the 30-day period referred to above.
13 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
14 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
15 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
16 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
17 operating identity consistent with this act.
18 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
19 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
20 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
21 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
22 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
23 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
24 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
25 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
26 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
27 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
28 other appropriate criteria;
29 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
30 several lines of insurance;
31 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
32 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
33 risks;
34 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
35 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
36 portfolio;
37 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
38 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
39 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
40 comparable insurers;
41 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
42 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
43 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed

SB 121 17
1 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
2 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
3 such investment so warrants; and
4 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
5 reported earnings include extraordinary items.
6 Sec. 7. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
7 3307. (a) Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in addition
8 to the powers which that the commissioner of insurance has under K.S.A.

12 amendments thereto, and such insurer's affiliates to ascertain the financial
13 condition, including enterprise risk, of such insurer including the
14 enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party or by any
15 entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company
16 system or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated
17 basis.
18 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
19 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
20 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
21 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
22 act.
23 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
24 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
25 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
26 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
27 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
28 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
29 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
30 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
31 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
32 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
33 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,
34 after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of not more than
35 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
36 insurer.
37 (c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered
38 insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts
39 not otherwise a part of the staff of the commissioner of insurance as the
40 commissioner of insurance shall determine to be reasonably necessary to
41 assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (a). Any persons
42 so retained shall be under the direction and control of the commissioner of
43 insurance and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.

SB 121 18
1 (d) Each registered insurer producing examination records, books and
2 papers pursuant to subsection (a) shall be liable for and shall pay the
3 expense of such examination in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223 and
4 K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
5 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
6 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
7 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
8 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance
9 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
10 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
11 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
12 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
13 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
14 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
15 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
16 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
17 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
18 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
19 examined.
20 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
21 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or
22 disclosed to the commissioner of insurance or any other person in the
23 course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to K.S.A. 40-
24 3307, and amendments thereto, and all information reported pursuant to

31 private civil action.
32 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance shall not otherwise make the
33 documents, materials or other information public without the prior written
34 consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the commissioner of
35 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
36 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the
37 provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act, determines that the
38 interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public would be served by
39 the publication thereof, in which event, the commissioner of insurance
40 may publish all or any part thereof in such a manner as the commissioner
41 of insurance may deem appropriate. In making such determination, the
42 commissioner of insurance also shall take into consideration any potential
43 adverse consequences of the disclosure thereof.
