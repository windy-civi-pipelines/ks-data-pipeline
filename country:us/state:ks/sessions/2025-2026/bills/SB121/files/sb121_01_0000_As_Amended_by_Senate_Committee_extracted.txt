22 requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and
23 accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide
24 supervisor, who has determined that such information is satisfactory to
25 allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach,
26 as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis handbook; and
27 (b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in a
28 reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
29 commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
30 the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
31 groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
32 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
33 amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
34 capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United
35 States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary
36 consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate
37 by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency
38 monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance
39 marketplace.
40 (C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital
41 calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead
42 state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling
43 person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a
SB 121—Am. by SC 12
1 limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria specified
2 by the commissioner in regulation.
3 (D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
4 holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements
5 for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this
6 section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital
7 calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the
8 lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.
9 (E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
10 registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
11 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall
12 be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding
13 company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
14 analysis handbook and that:
15 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
16 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
17 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
18 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
19 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
20 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
21 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
22 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
23 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
24 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
25 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
26 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
27 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
28 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
29 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
30 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
31 framework for that data year.
32 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
33 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
34 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
35 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
36 determination for an insurer.
37 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
38 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
39 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
40 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
41 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
42 framework.
43 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
SB 121—Am. by SC 13
1 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
2 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
3 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
4 insurer, as applicable.
5 Sec. 6. 7. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
6 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
7 shall be subject to the following standards:
8 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
9 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
10 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
11 commissioner of insurance;
12 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
13 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
14 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
15 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
16 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
17 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
18 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
19 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
20 to the respective parties; and
21 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
22 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
23 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
24 to its financial needs.
25 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
26 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
27 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
28 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
29 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
30 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
31 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
32 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
33 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
34 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
35 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
36 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
37 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
38 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
39 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
40 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
41 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
42 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
43 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
SB 121—Am. by SC 14
1 only with a specific person;
2 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
3 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
4 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
5 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
6 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
7 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
8 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
9 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
10 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
11 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
12 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
13 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
14 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
15 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
16 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
17 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
18 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
19 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
20 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
21 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
22 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
23 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
24 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
25 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
26 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
27 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
28 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
29 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
30 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
31 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
32 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
33 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
34 such period.
35 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
36 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
37 exceed:
38 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
39 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
40 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
41 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
42 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
43 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
SB 121—Am. by SC 15
1 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
2 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
3 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
4 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
5 transactions are equal to or exceed:
6 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
7 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
8 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
9 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
10 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
11 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
12 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
13 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
14 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
15 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
16 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
17 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
18 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
19 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
20 more affiliates of the insurer;
21 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
22 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
23 (5) any material material transactions, specified by rules and
24 regulations, which that the commissioner of insurance determines may
25 adversely affect the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
26 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
27 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
28 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
29 otherwise contrary to law.
30 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
31 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
32 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
33 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
34 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner
35 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into
36 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
37 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
38 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
39 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
40 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
41 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
42 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
43 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
SB 121—Am. by SC 16
1 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
2 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
3 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
4 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
5 be subject to the requirements of this section.
6 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
7 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
8 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
9 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
10 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
11 payment; or
12 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
13 such 30-day period.
14 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
15 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
16 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
17 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
18 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
19 December 31 immediately preceding; or
20 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
21 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
22 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
23 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
24 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
25 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
26 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
27 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
28 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
29 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
30 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
31 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
32 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
33 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
34 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
35 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
36 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
37 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
38 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
39 accordance with this section.
40 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
41 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
42 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
43 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
SB 121—Am. by SC 17
1 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
2 such dividend or distribution; or
3 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
4 within the 30-day period referred to above.
5 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
6 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
7 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
8 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
9 operating identity consistent with this act.
10 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
11 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
12 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
13 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
14 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
15 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
16 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
17 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
18 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
19 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
20 other appropriate criteria;
21 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
22 several lines of insurance;
23 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
24 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
25 risks;
26 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
27 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
28 portfolio;
29 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
30 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
31 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
32 comparable insurers;
33 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
34 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
35 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
36 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
37 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
38 such investment so warrants; and
39 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
40 reported earnings include extraordinary items.
41 Sec. 7. 8. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-

7 entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company
8 system or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated
9 basis.
10 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
11 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
12 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
13 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
14 act.
15 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
16 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
17 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
18 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
19 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
20 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
21 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
22 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
23 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
24 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
25 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,
26 after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of not more than
27 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
28 insurer.
29 (c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered

37 papers pursuant to subsection (a) shall be liable for and shall pay the
38 expense of such examination in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223 and
39 K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
40 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
41 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
42 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
43 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance
SB 121—Am. by SC 19
1 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
2 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
3 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
4 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
5 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
6 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
7 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
8 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
9 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
10 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
11 examined.
12 Sec. 8. 9. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
13 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or
14 disclosed to the commissioner of insurance or any other person in the

27 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
28 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the
29 provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act, determines that the
30 interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public would be served by
31 the publication thereof, in which event, the commissioner of insurance
32 may publish all or any part thereof in such a manner as the commissioner
33 of insurance may deem appropriate. In making such determination, the
34 commissioner of insurance also shall take into consideration any potential
35 adverse consequences of the disclosure thereof.

39 the manner provided by K.S.A. 40-3305(k), and amendments thereto, that
40 control does not exist in fact. The commissioner of insurance may
41 determine, after a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas
42 administrative procedure act, that control exists in fact, notwithstanding
43 the absence of a presumption to that effect.

29 insurer to comply with the provisions of this act.
30 (g) The commissioner of insurance shall terminate the registration of
31 any insurer that demonstrates that such insurer is no longer is a member of

1 (k) Any person may file with the commissioner of insurance a
2 disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer or such a disclaimer
3 may be filed by such insurer or any member of an insurance holding
4 company system. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material
5 relationships and bases for affiliation between such person and such
6 insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation. After a
7 disclaimer has been filed, the insurer shall be relieved of any duty to
8 register or report under this section which that may arise out of the
9 insurer's relationship with such person unless and until the commissioner
10 of insurance disallows such a disclaimer. The commissioner of insurance
11 shall disallow such a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest
12 with notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the provisions
13 of the Kansas administrative procedure act.
14 (l) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the ultimate controlling
15 person of every insurer subject to registration also shall file an annual
16 enterprise risk report. The report, to the best of the ultimate controlling
17 person's knowledge and belief, shall identify the material risks within the
18 insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the
19 insurer. The report shall be appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity
20 of the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of
21 insurance of the insurance holding company system as determined by the
22 procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the national
23 association of insurance commissioners NAIC. The first enterprise risk
24 report shall be filed no not later than May 1, 2015, and annually thereafter
25 by May 1 of each year unless the commissioner of insurance extends the
26 time for filing for good cause shown.
27 (2) The ultimate controlling person of a domestic insurer that is
28 authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business of insurance only
29 in this state with total direct and assumed annual premiums of less than
30 $300 million is not required to submit an enterprise risk report under
31 paragraph (1) unless the ultimate controlling person of the domestic
32 insurer also controls other insurers that do not meet the requirements of
33 this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, an insurer is not
34 considered to be authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business
35 of insurance only in this state if the insurer directly or indirectly writes or
36 assumes insurance in any other manner in another state(A) Except as
37 provided hereunder, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer
38 subject to registration shall concurrently file with the registration an
39 annual group capital calculation as directed by the lead state
40 commissioner. The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC
41 group capital calculation instructions, which may permit the lead state
42 commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate
43 controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The report shall be

SB 121—Am. by SC 11
1 filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company
2 system as determined by the commissioner of insurance in accordance
3 with the procedures within the financial analysis handbook. An insurance
4 holding company system shall be exempt from filing the group capital
5 calculation if:
6 (i) It has only one insurer within its holding company structure, only
7 writes business is only licensed in its domestic state and assumes no
8 business from any other insurer;
9 (ii) it is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by
10 the board of governors of the federal reserve system. The lead state
11 commissioner shall request the calculation from the federal reserve board
12 under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. If the federal
13 reserve board cannot share the calculation with the lead state
14 commissioner, the insurance holding company shall not be exempt from
15 the group capital calculation filing;
16 (iii) its non-United States group-wide supervisor is located within a
17 reciprocal jurisdiction, as defined in K.S.A. 40-221a, and amendments
18 thereto, that recognizes the United States regulatory approach to group
19 supervision and group capital; and
20 (iv) it is an insurance holding company system:
21 (a) That provides information to the lead state that meets the
22 requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and
23 accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide
24 supervisor, who has determined that such information is satisfactory to
25 allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach,
26 as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis handbook; and
27 (b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in a
28 reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
29 commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
30 the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
31 groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
32 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
33 amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
34 capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United
35 States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary
36 consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate
37 by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency
38 monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance
39 marketplace.
40 (C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital
41 calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead
42 state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling
43 person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a

SB 121—Am. by SC 12
1 limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria specified
2 by the commissioner in regulation.
3 (D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
4 holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements
5 for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this
6 section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital
7 calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the
8 lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.
9 (E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
10 registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
11 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall
12 be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding
13 company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
14 analysis handbook and that:
15 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
16 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
17 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
18 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
19 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
20 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
21 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
22 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
23 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
24 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
25 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
26 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
27 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
28 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
29 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
30 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
31 framework for that data year.
32 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
33 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
34 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
35 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
36 determination for an insurer.
37 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
38 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
39 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
40 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
41 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
42 framework.
43 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the

SB 121—Am. by SC 13
1 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
2 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
3 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
4 insurer, as applicable.
5 Sec. 6. 7. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
6 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
7 shall be subject to the following standards:

14 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
15 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
16 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
17 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
18 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
19 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
20 to the respective parties; and
21 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
22 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be

26 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
27 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
28 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
29 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
30 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
31 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
32 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
33 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
34 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
35 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
36 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
37 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
38 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
39 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
40 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
41 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
42 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
43 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract

12 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
13 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
14 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
15 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
16 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
17 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
18 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
19 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
20 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
21 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
22 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of

26 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
27 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
28 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
29 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
30 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
31 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
32 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
33 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
34 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
35 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
36 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
37 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
38 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
39 accordance with this section.
40 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
41 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
42 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
43 confer any rights upon shareholders until:

SB 121—Am. by SC 17
1 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
2 such dividend or distribution; or
3 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
4 within the 30-day period referred to above.
5 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
6 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
7 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
8 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
9 operating identity consistent with this act.
10 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
11 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
12 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
13 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
14 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
15 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
16 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
17 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
18 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
19 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
20 other appropriate criteria;
21 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
22 several lines of insurance;
23 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
24 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
25 risks;
26 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
27 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
28 portfolio;
29 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
30 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
31 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
32 comparable insurers;
33 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
34 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
35 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
36 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
37 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
38 such investment so warrants; and
39 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
40 reported earnings include extraordinary items.
41 Sec. 7. 8. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
42 3307. (a) Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in addition

4 amendments thereto, and such insurer's affiliates to ascertain the financial
5 condition, including enterprise risk, of such insurer including the
6 enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party or by any
7 entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company
8 system or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated
9 basis.
10 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
11 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
12 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
13 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
14 act.
15 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
16 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
17 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
18 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
19 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
20 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
21 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
22 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
23 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
24 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
25 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,
26 after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of not more than
27 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
28 insurer.
29 (c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered
30 insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts
31 not otherwise a part of the staff of the commissioner of insurance as the
32 commissioner of insurance shall determine to be reasonably necessary to
33 assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (a). Any persons
34 so retained shall be under the direction and control of the commissioner of
35 insurance and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.
36 (d) Each registered insurer producing examination records, books and
37 papers pursuant to subsection (a) shall be liable for and shall pay the
38 expense of such examination in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223 and
39 K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
40 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
41 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
42 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
43 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance

SB 121—Am. by SC 19
1 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
2 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
3 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
4 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
5 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
6 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
7 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
8 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
9 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
10 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
11 examined.
12 Sec. 8. 9. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
13 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or
14 disclosed to the commissioner of insurance or any other person in the
15 course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to K.S.A. 40-
16 3307, and amendments thereto, and all information reported pursuant to

23 private civil action.
24 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance shall not otherwise make the
25 documents, materials or other information public without the prior written
26 consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the commissioner of
27 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
28 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the
29 provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act, determines that the
30 interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public would be served by
31 the publication thereof, in which event, the commissioner of insurance
32 may publish all or any part thereof in such a manner as the commissioner
33 of insurance may deem appropriate. In making such determination, the
34 commissioner of insurance also shall take into consideration any potential
35 adverse consequences of the disclosure thereof.
36 (2) For purposes of the information reported and provided to the
37 commissioner pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304 through 40-3307, and
38 amendments thereto, the commissioner shall maintain the confidentiality

7 authority of the commissioner of insurance or with whom such documents,
8 materials or other information are shared pursuant to this section shall be
9 permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any
10 confidential documents, materials or information subject to subsection (a).
11 (d) In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner of
12 insurance's duties, the commissioner of insurance:
13 (1) May share documents, materials or other information, including
14 the confidential and privileged documents, materials or information
15 subject to subsection (a), with other state, federal and international
16 regulatory agencies, with the national association of insurance

39 disclosure pursuant to the open records act, K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., and
40 amendments thereto; and
41 (4) shall enter into written agreements with the national association of
42 insurance commissioners governing sharing and use of information
43 provided pursuant to this act consistent with this subsection that shall:

SB 121—Am. by SC 21
1 (i) Specify procedures and protocols regarding the confidentiality and

32 involving a third-party consultant, provide for notification of the identity
33 of the consultant to the applicable insurers.
34 (e) The sharing of information by the commissioner of insurance,
35 pursuant to this act, shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority
36 or rule-making rulemaking authority, and the commissioner of insurance is
37 solely responsible for the administration, execution and enforcement of the
38 provisions of this act.
