28 as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis handbook; and
29 (b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in a
30 reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
31 commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
32 the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
33 groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
34 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
35 amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
36 capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United
37 States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary
38 consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate
39 by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency
40 monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance
41 marketplace.
42 (C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital
43 calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead

SB 121—Am. by HC 12
1 state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling
2 person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a
3 limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria specified
4 by the commissioner in regulation.
5 (D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
6 holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements
7 for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this
8 section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital
9 calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the
10 lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.
11 (E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
12 registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
13 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall
14 be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding
15 company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
16 analysis handbook and that:
17 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
18 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
19 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
20 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
21 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
22 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
23 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
24 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
25 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
26 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
27 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
28 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
29 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
30 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
31 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
32 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
33 framework for that data year.
34 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
35 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
36 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
37 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
38 determination for an insurer.
39 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
40 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
41 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
42 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
43 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the

SB 121—Am. by HC 13
1 framework.
2 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
3 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
4 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
5 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
6 insurer, as applicable.
7 Sec. 6. 7. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
8 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
9 shall be subject to the following standards:
10 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
11 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
12 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
13 commissioner of insurance;
14 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
15 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
16 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
17 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
18 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
19 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
20 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
21 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
22 to the respective parties; and
23 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
24 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
25 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
26 to its financial needs.
27 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
28 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
29 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
30 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
31 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
32 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
33 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
34 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
35 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
36 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
37 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
38 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
39 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
40 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
41 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
42 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
43 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the

SB 121—Am. by HC 14
1 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
2 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
3 only with a specific person;
4 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
5 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
6 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
7 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
8 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
9 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
10 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
11 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
12 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
13 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
14 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
15 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
16 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
17 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
18 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
19 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
20 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
21 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
22 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
23 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
24 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
25 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
26 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
27 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
28 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
29 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
30 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
31 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
32 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
33 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
34 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
35 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
36 such period.
37 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
38 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
39 exceed:
40 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
41 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
42 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
43 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.

SB 121—Am. by HC 15
1 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
2 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
3 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
4 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
5 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
6 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
7 transactions are equal to or exceed:
8 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
9 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
10 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
11 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
12 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
13 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
14 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
15 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
16 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
17 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
18 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
19 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
20 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
21 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
22 more affiliates of the insurer;
23 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
24 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
25 (5) any material material transactions, specified by rules and
26 regulations, which that the commissioner of insurance determines may
27 adversely affect the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
28 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
29 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
30 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
31 otherwise contrary to law.
32 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
33 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
34 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
35 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
36 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner
37 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into
38 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
39 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
40 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
41 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
42 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
43 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.

SB 121—Am. by HC 16
1 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
2 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
3 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
4 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
5 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
6 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
7 be subject to the requirements of this section.
8 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
9 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
10 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
11 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
12 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
13 payment; or
14 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
15 such 30-day period.
16 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
17 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
18 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
19 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
20 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
21 December 31 immediately preceding; or
22 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
23 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
24 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
25 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
26 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
27 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
28 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
29 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
30 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
31 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
32 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
33 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
34 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
35 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
36 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
37 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
38 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
39 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
40 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
41 accordance with this section.
42 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
43 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional

SB 121—Am. by HC 17
1 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
2 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
3 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
4 such dividend or distribution; or
5 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
6 within the 30-day period referred to above.
7 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
8 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
9 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
10 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
11 operating identity consistent with this act.
12 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
13 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
14 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
15 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
16 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
17 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
18 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
19 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
20 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
21 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
22 other appropriate criteria;
23 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
24 several lines of insurance;
25 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
26 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
27 risks;
28 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
29 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
30 portfolio;
31 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
32 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
33 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
34 comparable insurers;
35 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
36 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
37 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
38 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
39 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
40 such investment so warrants; and
41 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
42 reported earnings include extraordinary items.
43 Sec. 7. 8. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-

9 entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company
10 system or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated
11 basis.
12 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
13 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
14 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
15 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
16 act.
17 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
18 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
19 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
20 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
21 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
22 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
23 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
24 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
25 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
26 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
27 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,
28 after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of not more than
29 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
30 insurer.
31 (c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered

41 K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
42 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
43 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for

SB 121—Am. by HC 19
1 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
2 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance
3 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
4 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
5 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
6 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
7 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
8 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
9 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
10 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
11 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
12 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
13 examined.
14 Sec. 8. 9. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
15 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or

29 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
30 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the
31 provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act, determines that the
32 interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public would be served by
33 the publication thereof, in which event, the commissioner of insurance
34 may publish all or any part thereof in such a manner as the commissioner
35 of insurance may deem appropriate. In making such determination, the
36 commissioner of insurance also shall take into consideration any potential
37 adverse consequences of the disclosure thereof.
