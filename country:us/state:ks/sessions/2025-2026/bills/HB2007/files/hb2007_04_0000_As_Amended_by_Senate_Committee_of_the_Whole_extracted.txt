21 employers away from employing individuals with disabilities under a
22 certificate issued by the United States secretary of labor under 29 U.S.C. §
23 214(c) and toward paying all such employees at least the minimum wage.
24 Such purpose shall be achieved by providing matching grants from fund
25 moneys to Kansas sheltered workshop employers that commit to paying at

27 $1-to-$1 basis by the Kansas sheltered workshop employer from nonstate
28 sources.
29 (b) Applications for matching grants shall be made by Kansas

34 services or any other appropriate state agency. The secretary for children
35 and families, secretary for aging and disability services or other state

2 award the Kansas sheltered workshop a matching grant in the amount
3 determined by the secretary. The secretary may award subsequent

5 satisfactory progress shown by such workshop employer pursuant to the
6 workshop employer's transition plan.

9 excluding any information prohibited from disclosure under state or
10 federal law, regarding the use of grant funds, use of associated nonstate

12 developed pursuant to subsection (b). Such information shall be utilized by
13 the secretary to analyze and monitor the use of grant funds and compliance
14 with and progress toward completion of the transition plan by workshop
15 employers and to develop best uses of grant funds and transition methods
