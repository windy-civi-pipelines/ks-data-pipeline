36 unincorporated area related to or serving a national park site or state
37 historic site if the request for funding is made by a nonprofit organization
38 or state agency that is willing to administer the moneys and oversee the
39 project, and the Kansas water authority deems such applicant capable of
40 successfully managing the project. Upon receipt of such a request, the
41 Kansas water office may award moneys in any fiscal year prior to July 1,
42 2028, with such awarding of moneys to be made at the discretion of the

15 control over a contradictory or incorrect numerical accounting code.
16 Sec. 170. Severability. If any provision or clause of this act or
