8 employers away from employing individuals with disabilities under a
9 certificate issued by the United States secretary of labor under 29 U.S.C. §
10 214(c) and toward paying all such employees at least the minimum wage.
11 Such purpose shall be achieved by providing matching grants from fund
12 moneys to Kansas sheltered workshop employers that commit to paying at

14 $1-to-$1 basis by the Kansas sheltered workshop employer from nonstate
15 sources.

32 award the Kansas sheltered workshop a matching grant in the amount
33 determined by the secretary. The secretary may award subsequent
34 additional grants to the same Kansas sheltered workshop employer upon
35 satisfactory progress shown by such workshop employer pursuant to the
36 workshop employer's transition plan.
