Sec. 9. On and after July 1, 2026, K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-229, as
amended by section 1 of 2025 House Bill No. 2166, is hereby amended
to read as follows: 45-229. (a) It is the intent of the legislature that
exceptions to disclosure under the open records act shall be created or
maintained only if:
(1) The public record is of a sensitive or personal nature
concerning individuals;
(2) the public record is necessary for the effective and efficient
administration of a governmental program; or
(3) the public record affects confidential information.
The maintenance or creation of an exception to disclosure must be
compelled as measured by these criteria. Further, the legislature finds
that the public has a right to have access to public records unless the
criteria in this section for restricting such access to a public record are
met and the criteria are considered during legislative review in
connection with the particular exception to disclosure to be significant
enough to override the strong public policy of open government. To
strengthen the policy of open government, the legislature shall consider
the criteria in this section before enacting an exception to disclosure.
(b) Subject to the provisions of subsections (g) and (h), any new
exception to disclosure or substantial amendment of an existing
exception shall expire on July 1 of the fifth year after enactment of the

SENATE Substitute for HOUSE BILL No. 2007—page 25
new exception or substantial amendment, unless the legislature acts to
continue the exception. A law that enacts a new exception or
substantially amends an existing exception shall state that the exception
expires at the end of five years and that the exception shall be reviewed
by the legislature before the scheduled date.
(c) For purposes of this section, an exception is substantially
amended if the amendment expands the scope of the exception to
include more records or information. An exception is not substantially
amended if the amendment narrows the scope of the exception.
(d) This section is not intended to repeal an exception that has
been amended following legislative review before the scheduled repeal
of the exception if the exception is not substantially amended as a result
of the review.
(e) In the year before the expiration of an exception, the revisor of
statutes shall certify to the president of the senate and the speaker of the
house of representatives, by July 15, the language and statutory citation
of each exception that will expire in the following year that meets the
criteria of an exception as defined in this section. Any exception that is
not identified and certified to the president of the senate and the
speaker of the house of representatives is not subject to legislative
review and shall not expire. If the revisor of statutes fails to certify an
exception that the revisor subsequently determines should have been
certified, the revisor shall include the exception in the following year's
certification after that determination.
(f) "Exception" means any provision of law that creates an
exception to disclosure or limits disclosure under the open records act
pursuant to K.S.A. 45-221, and amendments thereto, or pursuant to any
other provision of law.
(g) A provision of law that creates or amends an exception to
disclosure under the open records law shall not be subject to review and
expiration under this act if such provision:
(1) Is required by federal law;
(2) applies solely to the legislature or to the state court system;
(3) has been reviewed and continued in existence twice by the
legislature; or
(4) has been reviewed and continued in existence by the
legislature during the 2013 legislative session and thereafter; or
(5) is a report of the results of an audit conducted by the United
States cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency.
(h) (1) The legislature shall review the exception before its
scheduled expiration and consider as part of the review process the
following:
(A) What specific records are affected by the exception;
(B) whom does the exception uniquely affect, as opposed to the
general public;
(C) what is the identifiable public purpose or goal of the
exception;
(D) whether the information contained in the records may be
obtained readily by alternative means and how it may be obtained;
(2) an exception may be created or maintained only if it serves an
identifiable public purpose and may be no broader than is necessary to
meet the public purpose it serves. An identifiable public purpose is
served if the legislature finds that the purpose is sufficiently compelling
to override the strong public policy of open government and cannot be
accomplished without the exception and if the exception:
(A) Allows the effective and efficient administration of a
governmental program that would be significantly impaired without the
exception;
(B) protects information of a sensitive personal nature concerning
individuals, the release of such information would be defamatory to
such individuals or cause unwarranted damage to the good name or
reputation of such individuals or would jeopardize the safety of such
individuals. Only information that would identify the individuals may
be excepted under this paragraph; or

combination of devices, or compilation of information that is used to
protect or further a business advantage over those who do not know or
use it, if the disclosure of such information would injure the affected
entity in the marketplace.
(3) Records made before the date of the expiration of an exception
shall be subject to disclosure as otherwise provided by law. In deciding
whether the records shall be made public, the legislature shall consider
whether the damage or loss to persons or entities uniquely affected by
the exception of the type specified in paragraph (2)(B) or (2)(C) would
occur if the records were made public.

Sec. 12. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 72-5170 is hereby amended to read as
follows: 72-5170. (a) (1) In order to accomplish the mission for Kansas
education, the state board shall design and adopt a school district
accreditation system based upon improvement in performance that
equals or exceeds the educational goal set forth in K.S.A. 72-3218(c),
and amendments thereto, and is measurable. The state board shall hold
all school districts accountable through the Kansas education systems
accreditation rules and regulations, or any successor accreditation
system and accountability plan adopted by the state board. The state
board also shall ensure that all school districts and the public schools
operated by such districts have programs and initiatives in place for
providing those educational capacities set forth in K.S.A. 72-3218(c),
and amendments thereto. On or before January 15 of each year, the
state board shall prepare and submit a report on the school district
accreditation system to the governor and the legislature.
(2) The accountability measures established pursuant to paragraph
(1) shall be applied both at the district level and at the school level.

this section shall be published in accordance with K.S.A. 2024 Supp.
72-1181, and amendments thereto.
(3) If a school district is not fully accredited and a corrective

and any subsequent reports prepared by the state board regarding the
progress of such school district in implementing and executing such
corrective action plan, shall be published on the state department of
education's internet website and such school district's internet website

thereto.
(4) If a school district is not accredited, the superintendent, or the

(b) The state board shall establish curriculum standards that reflect

shall may be reviewed at least every seven years. The state board shall
not substantially revise or update the English language arts or
mathematics curriculum standards that are in effect on July 1, 2024, in
a manner that would necessitate the development of new statewide
assessments in English language arts or mathematics until the state
board's long-term goal for all students submitted to the United States
department of education in the consolidated state plan is achieved such

SENATE Substitute for HOUSE BILL No. 2007—page 33
that 75% of all students score in performance levels 3 and 4 combined

determine its own curriculum.
(c) (1) The state board shall provide for statewide assessments in
the core academic areas of mathematics, science, reading, writing and
social studies. The board shall ensure compatibility between the
statewide assessments and the curriculum standards established
pursuant to subsection (b). Such assessments shall be administered at
three grade levels, as determined by the state board. The state board
shall determine performance levels on the statewide assessments, the
achievement of which represents high academic standards in the
academic area at the grade level to which the assessment applies. The
state board should specify high academic standards both for individual
performance and school performance on the assessments.
(2) (A) On or before January 15 of each year, the state board shall
prepare and submit to the legislature a report on students who take the
statewide assessments. Such report shall include:
(i) The number of students and such number expressed as a
percentage of the total number of students who took the statewide
assessments during the immediately preceding school year
disaggregated by core academic area and by grade level; and
(ii) the percentage of students who took the statewide assessments
in grade 10 who, two years after graduating from high school, obtained
some postsecondary education disaggregated by statewide assessment
achievement level.
(B) When such information becomes available, or as soon
thereafter as practicable, the state board shall publish the information
required for the report under subparagraph (A) on the website of the
state department of education and incorporate such information in the
performance accountability reports and longitudinal achievement
reports required under K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 72-5178, and amendments
thereto.
(C) The provisions of this paragraph shall expire on July 1, 2029.
(d) Each school year, on such date as specified by the state board,
each school district shall submit the Kansas education system
accreditation report to the state board in such form and manner as
prescribed by the state board.
(e) Whenever the state board determines that a school district has
failed either to meet the accreditation requirements established by rules
and regulations or standards adopted by the state board or provide
curriculum based on state standards and courses required by state law,
the state board shall so notify the school district. Such notice shall
specify the accreditation requirements that the school district has failed
to meet and the curriculum that it has failed to provide. Upon receipt of
such notice, the board of education of such school district is
encouraged to reallocate the resources of the school district to remedy
all deficiencies identified by the state board.
(f) Each school in every school district shall establish a school site
council composed of the principal and representatives of teachers and
other school personnel, parents of students attending the school, the
business community and other community groups. School site councils
shall be responsible for providing advice and counsel in evaluating
state, school district, and school site performance goals and objectives
and in determining the methods that should be employed at the school
site to meet these goals and objectives. Site councils may make
recommendations and proposals to the school board regarding
budgetary items and school district matters, including, but not limited
to, identifying and implementing the best practices for developing
efficient and effective administrative and management functions. Site
councils also may help school boards analyze the unique environment
of schools, enhance the efficiency and maximize limited resources,
including outsourcing arrangements and cooperative opportunities as a
