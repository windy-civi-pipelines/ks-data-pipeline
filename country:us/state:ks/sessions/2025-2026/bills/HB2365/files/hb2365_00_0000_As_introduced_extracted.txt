7 granting such authority to the temporary guardian or guardian as is
8 appropriate, including continuing authority to the guardian to readmit the
9 ward to an appropriate treatment facility as may later become necessary.
10 Any such grant of continuing authority shall expire two years after the date
11 of final discharge of the ward from such a treatment facility if the ward has
12 not had to be readmitted to a treatment facility during that two-year period
13 of time. Thereafter, any such grant of continuing authority may be renewed

15 with the provision of this section.
16 (g) Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the head of a
17 treatment facility from admitting a proposed ward or ward to that facility

19 the proposed ward or ward at that time has the capacity to understand such
20 ward's illness and need for treatment, and to consent to such ward's
21 admission and treatment. Upon any such admission, the head of the
22 treatment facility shall give notice to the temporary guardian or guardian
23 as soon as possible of the ward's admission, and shall provide to the

25 or ward has given. Thereafter, the temporary guardian or guardian shall

28 further care and treatment, or shall otherwise assume responsibility for the
29 care of the proposed ward or ward, consistent with the authority of the
30 temporary guardian or guardian, and may arrange for the discharge from
