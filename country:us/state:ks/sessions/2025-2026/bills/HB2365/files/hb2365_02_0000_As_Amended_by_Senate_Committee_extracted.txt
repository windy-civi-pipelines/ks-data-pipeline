34 petition, or as the court may otherwise specify, or upon the discharge of
35 the proposed ward or ward by the head of the treatment facility, if the
36 proposed ward or ward is discharged prior to the time at which the order
37 would otherwise expire.
38 (3) For good cause shown, an order of continuance of the hearing.
39 (4) For good cause shown, an order of advancement of the hearing.
40 (5) For good cause shown, an order changing the place of the hearing.

7 necessary for the conduct of the proceedings may be excluded as provided
8 for in those acts. The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner
9 as may be consistent with orderly procedure. The court shall have the
10 authority to receive all relevant and material evidence which may be

20 proposed ward or ward to a treatment facility, the court may enter an order
21 granting such authority to the temporary guardian or guardian as is
22 appropriate, including continuing authority to the guardian to readmit the
23 ward to an appropriate treatment facility as may later become necessary.
24 Any such grant of continuing authority shall expire two years after the date
25 of final discharge of the ward from such a treatment facility if the ward has
26 not had to be readmitted to a treatment facility during that two-year period
27 of time. Thereafter, any such grant of continuing authority may be renewed
28 only after the filing of another petition seeking authority in compliance
29 with the provision of this section.
30 (g) Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the head of a
31 treatment facility from admitting a proposed ward or ward to that facility
32 as a voluntary patient if the head of the treatment facility is satisfied that
33 the proposed ward or ward at that time has the capacity to understand such
34 ward's illness and need for treatment, and to consent to such ward's
35 admission and treatment. Upon any such admission, the head of the
36 treatment facility shall give notice to the temporary guardian or guardian
37 as soon as possible of the ward's admission, and shall provide to the
38 temporary guardian or guardian copies of any consents the proposed ward
39 or ward has given. Thereafter, the temporary guardian or guardian shall
40 timely either seek to obtain proper authority pursuant to this section to
41 admit the proposed ward or ward to a treatment facility and to consent to
42 further care and treatment, or shall otherwise assume responsibility for the
43 care of the proposed ward or ward, consistent with the authority of the
HB 2365—Am. by SC 31
1 temporary guardian or guardian, and may arrange for the discharge from
