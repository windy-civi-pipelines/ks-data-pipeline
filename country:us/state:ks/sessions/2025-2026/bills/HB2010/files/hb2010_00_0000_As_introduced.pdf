30 Sec. 21. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,261 is hereby amended to read as
31 follows: 79-32,261. (a) (1) On and after July 1, 2008, any taxpayer who
32 contributes in the manner prescribed by this paragraph to a community
33 college located in Kansas for capital improvements, to a technical college
34 for deferred maintenance or the purchase of technology or equipment or to
35 a postsecondary educational institution located in Kansas for deferred
36 maintenance, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by the
37 Kansas income tax act, the premium tax or privilege fees imposed
38 pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or the privilege tax as
39 measured by net income of financial institutions imposed pursuant to
40 article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments
41 thereto. The tax credit allowed by this paragraph is applicable for the tax
42 year 2008 for any contributions made on and after July 1, 2008, and for the
43 tax years 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 for any contributions made during

HB 2010 21
1 the entire tax year. The amount of the credit allowed by this paragraph
2 shall not exceed 60% of the total amount contributed during the taxable
3 year by the taxpayer to a community college or a technical college located
4 in Kansas for such purposes. The amount of the credit allowed by this
5 paragraph shall not exceed 50% of the total amount contributed during the
6 taxable year by the taxpayer to a postsecondary educational institution for
7 such purposes. If the amount of the credit allowed by this paragraph for a
8 taxpayer who contributes to a community college or a technical college
9 exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability imposed by the Kansas income
10 tax act, such excess amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer. If the
11 amount of the tax credit for a taxpayer who contributes to a postsecondary
12 educational institution exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for the
13 taxable year, the amount which that exceeds the tax liability may be
14 carried over for deduction from the taxpayer's income tax liability in the
15 next succeeding taxable year or years until the total amount of the tax
16 credit has been deducted from tax liability, except that no such tax credit
17 shall be carried over for deduction after the third taxable year succeeding
18 the taxable year in which the contribution is made. Prior to the issuance of
19 any tax credits pursuant to this paragraph, the structure of the process in
20 which contributions received by a community college, a technical college
21 or a postsecondary educational institution qualify as tax credits allowed
22 and issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be developed by a community
23 college, a technical college and a postsecondary educational institution in
24 consultation with the secretary of revenue and the foundation or
25 endowment association of any such community college, technical college
26 or postsecondary educational institution in a manner that complies with
27 requirements specified in the federal internal revenue code of 1986, as
28 amended, so that contributions qualify as charitable contributions
29 allowable as deductions from federal adjusted gross income.
30 (2) On and after July 1, 2022, any taxpayer who contributes in the
31 manner prescribed by this paragraph to a community college or technical
32 college located in Kansas for capital improvements, deferred maintenance
33 or the purchase of technology or equipment shall be allowed a credit
34 against the tax imposed by the Kansas income tax act, the premium tax or
35 privilege fees imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments
36 thereto, or the privilege tax as measured by net income of financial
37 institutions imposed pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas
38 Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto. The tax credit allowed by
39 this paragraph is applicable for the tax year 2022 for any contributions
40 made on and after July 1, 2022, and for the tax years 2023, 2024, 2025 and
41 2026 for any contributions made during the entire tax year. The amount of
42 the credit allowed by this paragraph shall equal 60% of the total amount
43 contributed during the taxable year by the taxpayer to a community college

HB 2010 22
1 or a technical college located in Kansas for such purposes. Prior to the
2 issuance of any tax credits pursuant to this paragraph, the structure of the
3 process in which contributions received by a community college or
4 technical college qualify as tax credits allowed and issued pursuant to this
5 paragraph shall be developed by a community college and technical
6 college in consultation with the secretary of revenue and the foundation or
7 endowment association of any such community college or technical
8 college in a manner that complies with requirements specified in the
9 federal internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, so that contributions
