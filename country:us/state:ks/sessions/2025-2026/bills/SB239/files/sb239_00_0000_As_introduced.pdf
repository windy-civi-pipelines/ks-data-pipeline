5 amending K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 21-6804 and 21-6805 and repealing the
6 existing sections.
7
8 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
9 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 21-6804 is hereby amended to read as
10 follows: 21-6804. (a) The provisions of this section shall be applicable to
11 the sentencing guidelines grid for nondrug crimes. The following
12 sentencing guidelines grid shall be applicable to nondrug felony crimes:

SB 239 2
1

SB 239 3
1 (b) Sentences expressed in the sentencing guidelines grid for nondrug
2 crimes represent months of imprisonment.
3 (c) The sentencing guidelines grid is a two-dimensional crime
4 severity and criminal history classification tool. The grid's vertical axis is
5 the crime severity scale which classifies current crimes of conviction. The
6 grid's horizontal axis is the criminal history scale which classifies criminal
7 histories.
8 (d) The sentencing guidelines grid for nondrug crimes as provided in
9 this section defines presumptive punishments for felony convictions,
10 subject to the sentencing court's discretion to enter a departure sentence.
11 The appropriate punishment for a felony conviction should depend on the
12 severity of the crime of conviction when compared to all other crimes and
13 the offender's criminal history.
14 (e) (1) The sentencing court has discretion to sentence at any place
15 within the sentencing range. In the usual case it is recommended that the
16 sentencing judge select the center of the range and reserve the upper and
17 lower limits for aggravating and mitigating factors insufficient to warrant a
18 departure.
19 (2) In presumptive imprisonment cases, the sentencing court shall
20 pronounce the complete sentence which shall include the:
21 (A) Prison sentence;
22 (B) maximum potential reduction to such sentence as a result of good
23 time; and
24 (C) period of postrelease supervision at the sentencing hearing.
25 Failure to pronounce the period of postrelease supervision shall not negate
26 the existence of such period of postrelease supervision.
27 (3) In presumptive nonprison cases, the sentencing court shall
28 pronounce the:
29 (A) Prison sentence; and
30 (B) duration of the nonprison sanction at the sentencing hearing.
31 (f) Each grid block states the presumptive sentencing range for an
32 offender whose crime of conviction and criminal history place such
33 offender in that grid block. If an offense is classified in a grid block below
34 the dispositional line, the presumptive disposition shall be
35 nonimprisonment. If an offense is classified in a grid block above the
36 dispositional line, the presumptive disposition shall be imprisonment. If an
37 offense is classified in grid blocks 5-H, 5-I or 6-G, the court may impose
38 an optional nonprison sentence as provided in subsection (q).
39 (g) The sentence for a violation of K.S.A. 21-3415, prior to its repeal,
40 aggravated battery against a law enforcement officer committed prior to
41 July 1, 2006, or a violation of K.S.A. 21-5412(d), and amendments
42 thereto, aggravated assault against a law enforcement officer, which places
43 the defendant's sentence in grid block 6-H or 6-I shall be presumed

SB 239 4
1 imprisonment. The court may impose an optional nonprison sentence as
2 provided in subsection (q).
3 (h) When a firearm is used to commit any person felony, the
4 offender's sentence shall be presumed imprisonment. The court may
5 impose an optional nonprison sentence as provided in subsection (q).
6 (i) (1) The sentence for the violation of the felony provision of K.S.A.
7 21-5414(c)(1)(C), 21-5823(b)(3) and (b)(4), 21-6412 and 21-6416, and
8 amendments thereto, shall be as provided by the specific mandatory
9 sentencing requirements of that section and shall not be subject to the
10 provisions of this section or K.S.A. 21-6807, and amendments thereto.
11 (2) If because of the offender's criminal history classification the
12 offender is subject to presumptive imprisonment or if the judge departs
13 from a presumptive probation sentence and the offender is subject to
14 imprisonment, the provisions of this section and K.S.A. 21-6807, and
15 amendments thereto, shall apply and the offender shall not be subject to
16 the mandatory sentence as provided in K.S.A. 21-5823, and amendments
17 thereto.
18 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other section, the term of
19 imprisonment imposed for the violation of the felony provision of K.S.A.
20 21-5414(c)(1)(C), 21-5823(b)(3) and (b)(4), 21-6412 and 21-6416, and
21 amendments thereto, shall not be served in a state facility in the custody of
22 the secretary of corrections. Prior to imposing any sentence pursuant to
23 this subsection, the court may consider assigning the defendant to a house
24 arrest program pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto.
25 (j) (1) The sentence for any persistent sex offender whose current
26 convicted crime carries a presumptive term of imprisonment shall be
27 double the maximum duration of the presumptive imprisonment term. The
28 sentence for any persistent sex offender whose current conviction carries a
29 presumptive nonprison term shall be presumed imprisonment and shall be
30 double the maximum duration of the presumptive imprisonment term.
31 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, as used in this
32 subsection, "persistent sex offender" means a person who:
33 (A) (i) Has been convicted in this state of a sexually violent crime, as

33 amendments thereto, or any attempt or conspiracy, as defined in K.S.A.
34 21-5301 and 21-5302, and amendments thereto, to commit any such act
35 with knowledge that a woman is pregnant and with the intent that such act
36 will compel such woman to obtain an abortion when such woman has
37 expressed her desire to not obtain an abortion, the sentence for such
38 offense shall be:
39 (A) If such offense is classified in severity level 2 through 10, one
40 severity level above the appropriate level for such offense; and
41 (B) (i) if such offense is classified in severity level 1, except as
42 otherwise provided in clause (ii), imprisonment for life, and such offender
43 shall not be eligible for probation or suspension, modification or reduction

SB 239 12
1 of sentence. In addition, such offender shall not be eligible for parole prior
2 to serving 25 years' imprisonment, and such 25 years' imprisonment shall
3 not be reduced by the application of good time credits. No other sentence
4 shall be permitted.
5 (ii) The provisions of clause (i) requiring the court to impose a
6 mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 25 years shall not apply if
7 the court finds the offender, because of the offender's criminal history
8 classification, is subject to presumptive imprisonment and the sentencing
9 range exceeds 300 months. In such case, the offender is required to serve a
10 mandatory minimum term equal to the sentence established pursuant to the
11 sentencing range.
12 (2) The sentence imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) shall not be
13 considered a departure and shall not be subject to appeal.
14 (cc) The sentence for a violation of K.S.A. 21-5430, and amendments
15 thereto, shall be presumed imprisonment and the offender shall be
16 sentenced to an additional 100 months of imprisonment if the trier of fact
17 makes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the violation of K.S.A. 21-
18 5430, and amendments thereto, caused the death of a person less than 18
19 years of age. Such sentence shall not be considered a departure and shall
20 not be subject to appeal.
21 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 21-6805 is hereby amended to read as
22 follows: 21-6805. (a) The provisions of this section shall be applicable to
23 the sentencing guidelines grid for drug crimes. The following sentencing
24 guidelines grid for drug crimes shall be applicable to felony crimes under
25 K.S.A. 21-5701 through 21-5717, and amendments thereto, except as
26 otherwise provided by law:

SB 239 13
1

SB 239 14
1 (b) Sentences expressed in the sentencing guidelines grid for drug
2 crimes in subsection (a) represent months of imprisonment.
3 (c) (1) The sentencing court has discretion to sentence at any place
4 within the sentencing range. In the usual case it is recommended that the
5 sentencing judge select the center of the range and reserve the upper and
6 lower limits for aggravating and mitigating factors insufficient to warrant a
7 departure. The sentencing court shall not distinguish between the
8 controlled substances cocaine base (9041L000) and cocaine hydrochloride
9 (9041L005) when sentencing within the sentencing range of the grid
10 block.
11 (2) In presumptive imprisonment cases, the sentencing court shall
12 pronounce the complete sentence which shall include the:
13 (A) Prison sentence;
14 (B) maximum potential reduction to such sentence as a result of good
15 time; and
16 (C) period of postrelease supervision at the sentencing hearing.
17 Failure to pronounce the period of postrelease supervision shall not negate
18 the existence of such period of postrelease supervision.
19 (3) In presumptive nonprison cases, the sentencing court shall
20 pronounce the prison sentence as well as the duration of the nonprison
21 sanction at the sentencing hearing.
22 (d) Each grid block states the presumptive sentencing range for an
23 offender whose crime of conviction and criminal history place such
24 offender in that grid block. If an offense is classified in a grid block below
25 the dispositional line, the presumptive disposition shall be
26 nonimprisonment. If an offense is classified in a grid block above the
27 dispositional line, the presumptive disposition shall be imprisonment. If an
28 offense is classified in grid blocks 4-E, 4-F, 4-G, 4-H, 4-I, 5-C or 5-D, the
29 court may impose an optional nonprison sentence as provided in K.S.A.
30 21-6804(q), and amendments thereto.
31 (e) The sentence for a second or subsequent conviction for unlawful
32 manufacturing of a controlled substance, K.S.A. 65-4159, prior to its
33 repeal, K.S.A. 2010 Supp. 21-36a03, prior to its transfer, K.S.A. 21-5703,
34 and amendments thereto, or a substantially similar offense from another
35 jurisdiction, if the controlled substance in any prior conviction was
36 methamphetamine, as defined by K.S.A. 65-4107(d)(3) or (f)(1), and
37 amendments thereto, or an analog thereof, shall be a presumptive term of
38 imprisonment of two times the maximum duration of the presumptive term
39 of imprisonment. The court may impose an optional reduction in such
40 sentence of not to exceed 50% of the mandatory increase provided by this
41 subsection upon making a finding on the record that one or more of the
42 mitigating factors as specified in K.S.A. 21-6815, and amendments
43 thereto, justify such a reduction in sentence. Any decision made by the

SB 239 15
1 court regarding the reduction in such sentence shall not be considered a
2 departure and shall not be subject to appeal.
3 (f) (1) The sentence for a third or subsequent felony conviction of
4 K.S.A. 65-4160 or 65-4162, prior to their repeal, K.S.A. 2010 Supp. 21-
5 36a06, prior to its transfer, or K.S.A. 21-5706, and amendments thereto,
6 shall be a presumptive term of imprisonment and the defendant shall be
7 sentenced to prison as provided by this section. The defendant's term of
8 imprisonment shall be served in the custody of the secretary of corrections
9 in a facility designated by the secretary. Subject to appropriations
10 therefore, the defendant shall participate in an intensive substance abuse
11 treatment program, of at least four months duration, selected by the
12 secretary of corrections. If the secretary determines that substance abuse
13 treatment resources are otherwise available, such term of imprisonment
14 may be served in a facility designated by the secretary of corrections in the
15 custody of the secretary of corrections to participate in an intensive
16 substance abuse treatment program. The secretary's determination
17 regarding the availability of treatment resources shall not be subject to
18 review. Upon the successful completion of such intensive treatment
19 program, the offender shall be returned to the court and the court may
20 modify the sentence by directing that a less severe penalty be imposed in
21 lieu of that originally adjudged. If the offender's term of imprisonment
22 expires, the offender shall be placed under the applicable period of
23 postrelease supervision.
24 (2) Such defendant's term of imprisonment shall not be subject to
25 modification under paragraph (1) if:
26 (A) The defendant has previously completed a certified drug abuse
27 treatment program, as provided in K.S.A. 75-52,144, and amendments
28 thereto;
29 (B) has been discharged or refused to participate in a certified drug
30 abuse treatment program, as provided in K.S.A. 75-52,144, and
31 amendments thereto;
32 (C) has completed an intensive substance abuse treatment program
33 under paragraph (1); or
34 (D) has been discharged or refused to participate in an intensive
35 substance abuse treatment program under paragraph (1).
36 (3) The sentence under this subsection shall not be considered a
37 departure and shall not be subject to appeal.
38 (g) (1) Except as provided further, if the trier of fact makes a finding
39 that an offender carried a firearm to commit a drug felony, or in
40 furtherance of a drug felony, possessed a firearm, in addition to the
41 sentence imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6801 through 21-6824, and
42 amendments thereto, the offender shall be sentenced to:
43 (A) Except as provided in subsection (g)(1)(B), an additional 6

SB 239 16
1 months' imprisonment; and
2 (B) if the trier of fact makes a finding that the firearm was
3 discharged, an additional 18 months' imprisonment.
4 (2) The sentence imposed pursuant to subsection (g)(1) shall be
5 presumptive imprisonment. Such sentence shall not be considered a
6 departure and shall not be subject to appeal.
7 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to violations of
8 K.S.A. 21-5706 or 21-5713, and amendments thereto.
9 (h) (1) Except as provided in subsection (j), the sentence for a
10 violation of the following with respect to material containing any quantity
11 of a fentanyl-related controlled substance shall be presumed imprisonment
12 and shall be two times the maximum duration of the presumptive term of
13 imprisonment:
14 (A) K.S.A. 21-5703, and amendments thereto; and
15 (B) K.S.A. 21-5705, and amendments thereto, if the violation is
16 classified as a drug severity level 1, 2 or 3 felony.
17 (2) Such sentence shall not be considered a departure and shall not be
18 subject to appeal.
19 (i) The sentence for a violation of K.S.A. 21-5703 or 21-5705, and
20 amendments thereto, shall be presumed imprisonment and shall be two
21 times the maximum duration of the presumptive term of imprisonment if
22 the trier of fact makes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the
23 controlled substance involved, because of its appearance or packaging,
24 was likely to be attractive to minors. Such sentence shall not be considered
25 a departure and shall not be subject to appeal.
26 (j) The sentence for a violation of K.S.A. 21-5705, and amendments
27 thereto, with respect to material containing any quantity of a fentanyl-
28 related controlled substances shall be presumed imprisonment and the
29 offender shall be sentenced to an additional 100 months of imprisonment
30 if the trier of fact makes a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the
31 violation of K.S.A. 21-5705, and amendments thereto, caused the death of
32 a person less than 18 years of age. Such sentence shall not be considered
33 a departure and shall not be subject to appeal.
34 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 21-6804 and 21-6805 are hereby repealed.
35 Sec. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
36 publication in the statute book.
