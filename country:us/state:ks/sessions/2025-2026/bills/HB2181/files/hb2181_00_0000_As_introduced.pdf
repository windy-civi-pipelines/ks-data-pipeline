23 party, the court shall vacate an unconfirmed award that determines a child-
24 related dispute if the moving party establishes that:

10 extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a judicial capacity.
11 (b) The immunity provided by this section supplements any immunity
12 under the other laws of this state.
13 (c) An arbitrator's failure to make a disclosure required by section 9,
14 and amendments thereto, shall not cause the arbitrator to lose immunity

16 (d) An arbitrator is not competent to testify, and may not be required
17 to produce records in a judicial, administrative or similar proceeding about
18 a statement, conduct, decision or ruling occurring during an arbitration, to
19 the same extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a judicial
20 capacity. This subsection does not apply to:
21 (1) The extent disclosure is necessary to determine a claim by the
22 arbitrator or arbitration organization against a party to the arbitration; or
23 (2) a hearing on a motion under section 19(a)(1) or (a)(2), and
24 amendments thereto, to vacate an award, if there is prima facie evidence
25 that a ground for vacating the award exists.

31 award the arbitrator reasonable attorney fees, costs and reasonable
32 expenses of litigation.
