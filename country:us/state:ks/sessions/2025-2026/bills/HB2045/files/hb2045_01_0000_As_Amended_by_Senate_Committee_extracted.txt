32 maintain an assigned claims plan to provide that any person, who suffers
33 injury in this state may obtain personal injury protection benefits through
34 such plan if:
35 (1) Personal injury protection benefits are not available to the injured
36 person, except that personal injury protection benefits shall not be deemed
37 unavailable to any person suffering injury while such person was the
38 operator of a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, for which the owner
39 thereof has rejected personal injury protection benefits pursuant to
40 subsection (f) of K.S.A. 40-3107, and amendments thereto;
41 (2) Motor vehicle liability insurance or self-insurance applicable to
42 the injury cannot be identified;
43 (3) Personal injury protection benefits applicable to the injury are
HB 2045—Am. by SC 6
1 inadequate to provide the contracted-for benefits because of financial
2 inability of an insurer or self-insurer to fulfill its obligation; however,
3 except that benefits available through the assigned claims plan shall be
4 excess over any benefits paid or payable through the Kansas insurance
5 guaranty association. If the personal injury protection benefits are not paid
6 by the Kansas insurance guaranty association within the limitation of time
7 specified in this act, such benefits shall be paid by the assigned claims
8 plan. Payments made by the assigned claims plan pursuant to this section
9 shall constitute covered claims under K.S.A. 40-2901et seq., and
10 amendments thereto.
11 (b) If a claim qualifies for assignment under this section, the assigned
12 claims plan or any insurer or self-insurer to whom the claim is assigned
13 shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the claimant against any insurer
14 or self-insurer, its successor in interest or substitute, legally obligated to
15 provide personal injury protection benefits to the claimant, for any of such
16 benefits provided by the assignment.
17 (c) A person shall not be entitled to personal injury protection
18 benefits through the assigned claims plan with respect to injury which that
19 such person has sustained if, at the time of such injury, such person was
20 the owner of a motor vehicle for which a policy of motor vehicle liability
21 insurance is required under this act and such person failed to have such
22 policy in effect.
23 (d) The assigned claims plan shall be governed by such rules and
24 regulations as are necessary for its operation and for the assessment of
25 costs, which shall be approved by the commissioner. Any claim brought
26 through said plan shall be assigned to an insurer or self-insurer, in
27 accordance with the approved regulations of operation, and such insurer or
28 self-insurer, after the assignment, shall have the same rights and
29 obligations as it would have if, prior to such assignment, it had issued a
30 motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing personal injury
31 protection benefits applicable to the loss or expenses incurred or was a
32 self-insurer providing such benefits. Any party accepting benefits
33 hereunder under this section shall have such rights and obligations as such
34 person would have if a motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing
35 personal injury protection benefits were issued to such person.
36 (e) No insurer shall write any motor vehicle liability insurance policy
37 in this state unless the insurer participates in the assigned claims plan
38 organized pursuant to this section, nor shall any person qualify as a self-
39 insurer pursuant to subsection (f) of K.S.A. 40-3104, and amendments
40 thereto, unless such person agrees to participate in such assigned claims
41 plan. Any insurer or self-insurer required to participate in the assigned
42 claims plan who violates this subsection shall be assessed a civil penalty of
43 not more than $5,000 for each policy issued or self-insurance certificate
HB 2045—Am. by SC 7
1 obtained in violation thereof.
2 (f) (1) On and after January 1, 2026, the governing committee of the
3 assigned claims plan shall consist of five members, who shall be

8 agents; and

33 the fund, however except that such transfers shall not occur more often

18 students attending a state educational institution as defined in K.S.A. 76-
19 711, and amendments thereto, and such students' dependents, except that
20 such insurance shall not provide coverage for elective procedures that are
21 not medically necessary as determined by a treating physician. The
22 participation by a student in such coverage shall be voluntary. In the case
23 of students who are employed by a state educational institution in a student
24 position, the level of employer contributions toward such coverage shall be
25 determined by the board of regents.
26 (2) The state board of regents is hereby authorized to independently
27 provide, through self-insurance or the purchase of insurance contracts,
28 health care healthcare benefits for employees of a state educational
29 institution, as such term is defined in K.S.A. 76-711, and amendments
30 thereto, when the state health care healthcare benefits program is
31 insufficient to satisfy the requirements of 22 C.F.R. § 62.14, as in effect
32 upon the effective date of this section April 13, 2017. Such healthcare
33 benefits shall be limited to only those for whom the state health care
34 healthcare benefits program does not meet federal requirements.
35 (3) The state board of regents may purchase cybersecurity insurance
36 as it deems necessary to protect student records, labor information and
37 other statutorily protected data that the board maintains, independent of the
38 committee on surety bonds and insurance and without complying with the
39 provisions of K.S.A. 75-3738 through 75-3744, and amendments thereto.
40 As used in this paragraph, "cybersecurity insurance" includes, but is not
41 limited to, first-party coverage against losses such as data destruction,
42 denial of service attacks, theft, hacking and liability coverage guaranteeing
43 compensation for damages from errors such as the failure to safeguard
HB 2045—Am. by SC 12
1 data.
2 (4) The state board of regents may adopt rules and regulations
3 necessary to administer and implement the provisions of this section.
4 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 40-2102, 40-2109, 40-3116, 40-3413 and 75-4101 are
5 hereby repealed.

30 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 40-3116 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
31 3116. (a) Insurers and self-insurers are hereby directed to organize and
32 maintain an assigned claims plan to provide that any person, who suffers
33 injury in this state may obtain personal injury protection benefits through
34 such plan if:
35 (1) Personal injury protection benefits are not available to the injured
36 person, except that personal injury protection benefits shall not be deemed
37 unavailable to any person suffering injury while such person was the
38 operator of a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, for which the owner
39 thereof has rejected personal injury protection benefits pursuant to
40 subsection (f) of K.S.A. 40-3107, and amendments thereto;
41 (2) Motor vehicle liability insurance or self-insurance applicable to
42 the injury cannot be identified;
43 (3) Personal injury protection benefits applicable to the injury are

HB 2045—Am. by SC 6
1 inadequate to provide the contracted-for benefits because of financial
2 inability of an insurer or self-insurer to fulfill its obligation; however,
3 except that benefits available through the assigned claims plan shall be
4 excess over any benefits paid or payable through the Kansas insurance
5 guaranty association. If the personal injury protection benefits are not paid
6 by the Kansas insurance guaranty association within the limitation of time
7 specified in this act, such benefits shall be paid by the assigned claims
8 plan. Payments made by the assigned claims plan pursuant to this section
9 shall constitute covered claims under K.S.A. 40-2901et seq., and
10 amendments thereto.
11 (b) If a claim qualifies for assignment under this section, the assigned
12 claims plan or any insurer or self-insurer to whom the claim is assigned
13 shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the claimant against any insurer
14 or self-insurer, its successor in interest or substitute, legally obligated to
15 provide personal injury protection benefits to the claimant, for any of such
16 benefits provided by the assignment.
17 (c) A person shall not be entitled to personal injury protection
18 benefits through the assigned claims plan with respect to injury which that
19 such person has sustained if, at the time of such injury, such person was
20 the owner of a motor vehicle for which a policy of motor vehicle liability
21 insurance is required under this act and such person failed to have such
22 policy in effect.
23 (d) The assigned claims plan shall be governed by such rules and
24 regulations as are necessary for its operation and for the assessment of
25 costs, which shall be approved by the commissioner. Any claim brought
26 through said plan shall be assigned to an insurer or self-insurer, in
27 accordance with the approved regulations of operation, and such insurer or
28 self-insurer, after the assignment, shall have the same rights and
29 obligations as it would have if, prior to such assignment, it had issued a
30 motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing personal injury
31 protection benefits applicable to the loss or expenses incurred or was a
32 self-insurer providing such benefits. Any party accepting benefits
33 hereunder under this section shall have such rights and obligations as such
34 person would have if a motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing
35 personal injury protection benefits were issued to such person.
36 (e) No insurer shall write any motor vehicle liability insurance policy
37 in this state unless the insurer participates in the assigned claims plan
38 organized pursuant to this section, nor shall any person qualify as a self-
39 insurer pursuant to subsection (f) of K.S.A. 40-3104, and amendments
40 thereto, unless such person agrees to participate in such assigned claims
41 plan. Any insurer or self-insurer required to participate in the assigned
42 claims plan who violates this subsection shall be assessed a civil penalty of
43 not more than $5,000 for each policy issued or self-insurance certificate

HB 2045—Am. by SC 7
1 obtained in violation thereof.
2 (f) (1) On and after January 1, 2026, the governing committee of the
3 assigned claims plan shall consist of five members, who shall be
4 removable by the commissioner for inefficiency, neglect of duty or
5 malfeasance. Members shall be appointed as follows:
6 (A) Three members shall be representatives of insurers;
7 (B) one member shall be a representative of independent insurance
8 agents; and
9 (C) one member shall be a representative of the general public.
10 (2) In selecting the members who shall be representatives of insurers,
11 the commissioner shall consider whether foreign and domestic insurers
12 are fairly represented.
13 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-3413 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
14 3413. (a) Every insurer and every rating organization shall cooperate in the
15 preparation of preparing a plan or plans for the equitable apportionment
16 among such insurers of applicants for professional liability insurance and
17 such other liability insurance as may be included in or added to the plan,

19 procure the same through ordinary methods. Such plan or plans shall be

21 within a reasonable time but not exceeding 60 calendar days from the
22 effective date of this act. Such plan or plans shall provide:
23 (1) Reasonable rules governing the equitable distribution of risks by
24 direct insurance, reinsurance or otherwise including the authority to make
25 assessments against the insurers participating in the plan or plans;

28 (3) a method whereby periodically the plan shall compare the
29 premiums earned to the losses and expenses sustained by the plan. If there
30 is any surplus of premiums over losses and expenses received for that year
31 such surplus shall be transferred to the fund. If there is any excess of losses
32 and expenses over premiums earned such losses shall be transferred from
33 the fund, however except that such transfers shall not occur more often
34 than once each three months;
35 (4) the limits of liability which that the plan shall be required to
36 provide, but in no event shall except that such limits shall not be less than
37 those limits provided for in subsection (a) of K.S.A. 40-3402, and
38 amendments thereto; and
39 (5) a method whereby by which applicants for insurance, insureds and
40 insurers may have a hearing on grievances and the right of appeal to the
41 commissioner.
42 (b) (1) For every such plan or plans, there shall be a governing board
43 which that shall meet at least annually to review and prescribe operating

HB 2045—Am. by SC 8
1 rules. Prior to December 31, 2025, such board of directors shall consist of
2 nine members to be appointed, for terms of four years, by the
3 commissioner as follows:

41 insurance policies shall be based upon reasonably prudent actuarial
42 principles. The provisions of this subsection shall expire on January 1,

13 in this section and K.S.A. 74-4925, 74-4927, 75-6501 through 75-6511
14 and 76-749, and amendments thereto, no state agency shall purchase any

16 employees, except as provided in this act. Except as otherwise provided in
17 this section, health care healthcare coverage and health care healthcare
18 services of a health maintenance organization for state officers and
19 employees designated under K.S.A. 75-6501(c), and amendments thereto,
20 shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-6501
21 through 75-6511, and amendments thereto.

24 organization for its employees or members of the highway patrol assigned,
25 by contract or agreement entered pursuant to K.S.A. 68-2025, and
26 amendments thereto, to police toll or turnpike facilities, independent of the
27 committee on surety bonds and insurance and of the provisions of K.S.A.
28 75-6501 through 75-6511, and amendments thereto. Such authority may
29 purchase liability insurance covering all or any part of its operations and

39 police toll or turnpike facilities from receiving compensation in the form
40 of insurance or health maintenance organization coverage as herein
41 authorized.

HB 2045—Am. by SC 11
1 liability and excess automobile liability insurance insuring volunteers

3 specifications of federal grant guidelines. Such agencies may purchase
4 such policy of insurance independent of the committee on surety bonds
5 and insurance and without complying with K.S.A. 75-3738 through 75-
6 3744, and amendments thereto.
7 (d) Any state educational institution as defined by K.S.A. 76-711, and
8 amendments thereto, may purchase insurance of any kind or nature except
9 employee health insurance. Such insurance shall be purchased on a
10 competitively bid or competitively negotiated basis in accordance with
11 procedures prescribed by the state board of regents. Such insurance may
12 be purchased independent of the committee on surety bonds and insurance
13 and without complying with K.S.A. 75-3738 through 75-3744, and
14 amendments thereto.
15 (e) (1) The state board of regents may enter into one or more group
16 insurance contracts to provide health and accident insurance coverage or
17 health care healthcare services of a health maintenance organization for all
18 students attending a state educational institution as defined in K.S.A. 76-
19 711, and amendments thereto, and such students' dependents, except that
20 such insurance shall not provide coverage for elective procedures that are
21 not medically necessary as determined by a treating physician. The
22 participation by a student in such coverage shall be voluntary. In the case
23 of students who are employed by a state educational institution in a student
24 position, the level of employer contributions toward such coverage shall be
25 determined by the board of regents.
26 (2) The state board of regents is hereby authorized to independently
27 provide, through self-insurance or the purchase of insurance contracts,
28 health care healthcare benefits for employees of a state educational
29 institution, as such term is defined in K.S.A. 76-711, and amendments
30 thereto, when the state health care healthcare benefits program is
31 insufficient to satisfy the requirements of 22 C.F.R. § 62.14, as in effect
32 upon the effective date of this section April 13, 2017. Such healthcare
33 benefits shall be limited to only those for whom the state health care
34 healthcare benefits program does not meet federal requirements.
35 (3) The state board of regents may purchase cybersecurity insurance
36 as it deems necessary to protect student records, labor information and
37 other statutorily protected data that the board maintains, independent of the
38 committee on surety bonds and insurance and without complying with the
39 provisions of K.S.A. 75-3738 through 75-3744, and amendments thereto.
40 As used in this paragraph, "cybersecurity insurance" includes, but is not
41 limited to, first-party coverage against losses such as data destruction,
42 denial of service attacks, theft, hacking and liability coverage guaranteeing
43 compensation for damages from errors such as the failure to safeguard

HB 2045—Am. by SC 12
1 data.

3 necessary to administer and implement the provisions of this section.
