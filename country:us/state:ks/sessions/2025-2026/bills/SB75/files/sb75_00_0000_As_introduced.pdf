17 time during the tax year on a form prescribed by the department of
18 revenue.
19 (g) (1) The department of revenue may consult with the state

23 amendments thereto, during the tax year for which the credit is claimed.
24 (2) By making a claim for the education opportunity tax credit, the

18 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
19 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
20 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
21 with the modifications specified in this section.
22 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
23 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
24 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
25 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
26 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
27 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
28 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
29 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
30 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
31 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
32 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after
33 December 31, 1987, shall be excluded from computation of Kansas
34 adjusted gross income whether or not included in federal adjusted gross
35 income.
36 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
37 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
38 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not

8 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
9 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
10 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
11 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as

13 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
