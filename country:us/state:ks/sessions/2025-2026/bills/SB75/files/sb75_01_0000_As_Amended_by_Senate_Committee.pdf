21 revenue.
22 (g) (1) The department of revenue may consult with the state

22 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
23 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
24 with the modifications specified in this section.
25 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
26 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
27 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
28 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
29 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
30 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
31 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
32 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
33 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
34 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
35 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after
36 December 31, 1987, shall be excluded from computation of Kansas

38 income.
39 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
40 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the

13 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
14 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
