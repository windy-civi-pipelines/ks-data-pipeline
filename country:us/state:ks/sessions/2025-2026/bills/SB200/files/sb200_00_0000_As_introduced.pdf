5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. (a) The state of Kansas is hereby designated as a purple
7 heart state in recognition of the many citizens of the state who have earned
8 the purple heart medal as a result of being wounded while engaged in
9 combat with an enemy force.
10 (b) Each year, the governor shall issue a proclamation recognizing the
11 purple heart day, to be observed on August 7 of each year, following the
12 tradition established by George Washington in 1782 and revived in 1932
13 that distinguishes the purple heart as a decoration of honor awarded to
14 members of the armed forces and United States citizens who were
15 honorably wounded in action. The award has been limited to members of
16 the military since 1997 by congressional action.
17 (c) The executive director of the office of veterans services shall
18 promote the observance of purple heart day with appropriate activities and
19 direct each local chapter of all veterans' organizations to plan special
20 activities and events to honor the purple heart recipients in each chapter.
21 (d) All residents of this state are enjoined to devote some portion of
22 purple heart day to recognizing and commemorating the recipients of the
23 purple heart who have demonstrated a commitment to fighting for the
24 ideals that have made this nation great, have served this nation so valiantly
25 and are role models for all to emulate.
26 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
27 publication in the statute book.
