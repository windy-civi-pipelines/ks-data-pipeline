24 unpaid balance of such tax due.
25 (d) If any taxpayer fails to file a return or pay the tax that is due at the
26 time required by or under the provisions of this act, there shall be added to
27 the tax an additional amount equal to 1% of the unpaid balance of the tax
28 due for each month or fraction thereof during which such failure

34 such return, a penalty shall be imposed for the period included in the
35 assessment in an amount of 1% per month not exceeding 10% of the
36 unpaid balance of tax due shown in the notice of assessment. If, after
37 review of a return for any period included in the assessment, the secretary
38 or secretary's designee determines that the underpayment of tax was due to
39 the failure of the taxpayer to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the
40 provisions of this act, such penalty shall be imposed for the period
41 included in the assessment in the amount of 25% of the unpaid balance of
42 tax due.

6 and (d) shall be in addition to the penalty added under any other provisions
7 of this section, but the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) shall be
8 mutually exclusive of each other.
9 (g) Whenever the secretary of revenue or the secretary's designee
10 determines that the failure of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of
11 subsections (b) and (c) was due to reasonable causes, the secretary or the
12 secretary's designee may waive or reduce any of the penalties and may
13 reduce the interest rate to the underpayment rate prescribed and
14 determined for the applicable period under section 6621 of the federal
15 internal revenue code as in effect on January 1, 2025, upon making a
16 record of the reasons therefor.

20 return, fails to keep any books or records necessary to determine the
21 accuracy of the person's reports, who willfully violates any regulations of
