11 with the modifications specified in this section.
12 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:

17 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
18 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
19 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
20 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
21 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
