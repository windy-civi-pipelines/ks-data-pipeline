3 Sec. 7. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
4 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
5 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
6 with the modifications specified in this section.
7 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
8 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
9 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
10 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
11 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
12 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
13 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
14 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
15 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
16 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on

20 income.

32 deduction of the taxes being refunded resulted in a tax benefit for Kansas
33 income tax purposes during a prior taxable year. Such refunds shall be
34 included in income in the year actually received regardless of the method
35 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
36 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
37 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
38 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
39 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
40 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
41 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
42 federal income taxes paid for such year. For purposes of the foregoing
