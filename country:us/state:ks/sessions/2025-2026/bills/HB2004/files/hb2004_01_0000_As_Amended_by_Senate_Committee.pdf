23 for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
24 (3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),

HB 2004—Am. by SC 21
1 purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy shall be apportioned
2 among each city in which such district extends in the proportion that such
3 tax levied within each city bears to the total tax levied by the district.
4 (d) (1) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
5 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(A), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G),

27 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
28 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
29 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
30 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
31 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
32 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
33 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.

30 by such organizations. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to
31 exempt the purchase of any construction machinery, equipment or tools
32 used in the constructing, remodeling, furnishing or equipping of
33 facilities for such organization. When such organization shall contract
34 for the purpose of constructing, remodeling, furnishing or equipping
35 such projects, it shall obtain from the state and furnish to the contractor
36 an exemption certificate for the project involved, and the contractor may
37 purchase materials for incorporation in such project. The contractor
38 shall furnish the number of such certificate to all suppliers from whom

42 organization a sworn statement, on a form to be provided by the director
43 of taxation, that all purchases so made were entitled to exemption under

1 this subsection. All invoices shall be held by the contractor for a period
2 of five years and shall be subject to audit by the director of taxation. If
3 any materials purchased under such a certificate are found not to have
4 been incorporated in such facilities or not to have been returned for
5 credit or the sales or compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such
6 materials that will not be so incorporated in such facilities reported and
7 paid by such contractor to the director of taxation no later than the 20th
8 day of the month following the close of the month in which it shall be
9 determined that such materials will not be used for the purpose for
10 which such certificate was issued, such organization shall be liable for
11 tax on all materials purchased for the project, and upon payment thereof
12 may recover the same from the contractor together with reasonable
13 attorney fees. Any contractor or agent, employee or subcontractor
14 thereof, who purchased under such a certificate for any purpose other
15 than that for which such a certificate is issued without the payment of
16 the sales or compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials,
17 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be
18 subject to the penalties provided for in K.S.A. 79-3615(h), and
19 amendments thereto. Sales tax paid on and after January 1, 2024, but
20 prior to the effective date of this act, upon the gross receipts received
21 from any sale exempted by the amendatory provisions of this subsection
22 shall be refunded. Each claim for a sales tax refund shall be verified and
23 submitted to the director of taxation upon forms furnished by the
24 director and shall be accompanied by any additional documentation
25 required by the director. The director shall review each claim and shall
26 refund that amount of sales tax paid as determined under the provisions
27 of this subsection. All refunds shall be paid from the sales tax refund
28 fund upon warrants of the director of accounts and reports pursuant to
29 vouchers approved by the director or the director's designee. The
