11 other work that the service company or any technical representative
12 employed by the service company has performed on electric vehicle
13 supply equipment, including installation, repair, calibration, adjustment or
14 other work performed at the site where the electric vehicle supply
15 equipment is used. Such reports shall be legible and maintained in an
16 accessible manner and for a period of time as established by the secretary
17 pursuant to rules and regulations.

19 service company, an authorized representative of the secretary or by or a
20 city or county department of public inspection of weights and measures

22 electric vehicle supply equipment does not comply with tolerances and
23 specifications adopted by the secretary, by rules and regulations, the
24 secretary may test the electric vehicle supply equipment for accuracy after
25 repairs have been made.
