5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. (a) This section shall apply only to assisted living facilities
7 that offer dementia care services. If assisted living facilities choose to

9 follow the requirements in this section. A facility that chooses to opt out of
10 following such requirements, shall not publicize that it offers specialized
11 dementia care, memory care, use the special dementia care designation or
12 the assisted living facility with dementia care certification.
13 (b) There is hereby created the assisted living facility with dementia
14 care certification. An applicant seeking certification as an assisted living
15 facility with dementia care shall have the ability to provide services in a
16 manner consistent with the requirements in this section. In determining
17 whether or not to award this certification to an applicant, the secretary of
18 the department for aging and disability services shall consider the
19 following criteria, including, but not limited to:
20 (1) The applicant's assisted living director, managerial official and
21 clinical nurse supervisor's experience with managing residents with
22 dementia or previous long-term care experience; and
23 (2) completion of a state-approved dementia care certification
24 program by the applicant's leadership.
25 (c) Facilities seeking such certification shall maintain staffing levels
26 sufficient to meet the care needs of residents, that shall be demonstrated
27 through periodic quality-of-care assessments.
28 (d) Prior to providing memory care services, all employees or
29 contract staff working with residents receiving memory care services shall
30 complete a department-approved, standardized dementia care training
31 program that is available online.
32 (1) Assisted living facilities that offer dementia care may use existing
33 training programs that meet state standards, which shall be established by
34 the department in rules and regulations. Training programs shall include
35 the following:

HB 2370 2
1 (A) Communicating and interacting with individuals with Alzheimer's
2 disease or other forms of dementia;
3 (B) the psychological, social and physical needs of individuals with
4 Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia;
5 (C) the benefits of non-pharmacological approaches to treatment; and
6 (D) safety measures necessary for individuals with Alzheimer's
7 disease or other forms of dementia.
8 (e) Employees or contract staff working with residents receiving
9 memory care services shall receive annual, evidence-based memory care
10 services training as determined by the department for aging and disability
11 services biennially.
12 (f) (1) The facility shall provide an activity services program to
13 residents who receive memory care services. The activity services program
14 shall:
15 (A) Involve the resident in an ongoing program of activities that are
16 designed to appeal to individual resident needs; and
17 (B) include a combination of large and small group, one-to-one and
18 self-directed activities.
19 (2) Facilities shall provide access to activities tailored to the needs of
20 residents with dementia, that can be provided by trained care staff rather
21 than dedicated activity staff.
22 (3) Group activities may substitute for one-on-one activities when
23 appropriate.
24 (g) The department of aging and disability services may impose
25 additional requirements for any long-term care facility if there are
26 unsatisfactory outcomes for a resident in such facility. The department
27 shall impose such requirements only after identifying significant
28 deficiencies in meeting resident care needs as documented in annual
29 inspections or complaint investigations.
30 (h) Evidence of a failure to meet the individual needs of residents
31 shall be grounds for enforcement action under this section.
32 (i) The department for aging and disability shall adopt rules and
33 regulations to implement and administer the provisions of sections 1 and 2,
34 and amendments thereto.
35 (j) The label "assisted living facility with dementia care" shall be
36 identified on the facility's license. Such facility providing dementia care
37 services may indicate this specialization in their license description if the
38 facility has the certification created by this section.
39 (k) Facilities that choose to apply for a dementia care certification
40 shall comply with the provisions of this section within 12 months of its
41 enactment.
42 (l) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 9 of
43 chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.

4 days prior to the voluntary relinquishment.
5 (2) If less than 10 residents would be affected by such

8 (b) For voluntary relinquishment, the facility shall:

18 (2) submit a transitional plan to the secretary of the department for
19 aging and disability services demonstrating how current residents will be
20 evaluated and assessed to reside in other housing settings that are not an
21 assisted living facility with memory care that are physically unsecured or
22 would require move-out or transfer to other settings;
23 (A) Assisted living facilities voluntarily relinquishing such facilities
24 dementia care certification may submit a general transition framework
25 rather than an individualized plan for each resident;
26 (3) change service or care plans as appropriate to address any needs
27 the residents may have with such transition;

29 services when the voluntary relinquishment process has been completed;
