10 Section 1. K.S.A. 8-2107 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-
11 2107. (a) (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the uniform act
12 regulating traffic on highways, when a person is stopped by a police
13 officer for any of the offenses described in subsection (d) and such person
14 is not immediately taken before a judge of the district court, the police
15 officer may require the person stopped, subject to the provisions of
16 subsection (c), to deposit with the officer a valid Kansas driver's license in
17 exchange for a receipt therefor issued by such police officer, the form of
18 which shall be approved by the division of vehicles. Such receipt shall be
19 recognized as a valid temporary Kansas driver's license authorizing the
20 operation of a motor vehicle by the person stopped until the date of the
21 hearing stated on the receipt. The driver's license and a written copy of the
22 notice to appear shall be delivered by the police officer to the court having
23 jurisdiction of the offense charged as soon as reasonably possible. If the
24 hearing on such charge is continued for any reason, the judge may note on
25 the receipt the date to which such hearing has been continued and such
26 receipt shall be recognized as a valid temporary Kansas driver's license
27 until such date, but in no event shall such receipt be recognized as a valid
28 Kansas driver's license for a period longer than 30 days from the date set
29 for the original hearing. Any person who has deposited a driver's license
30 with a police officer under this subsection shall have such license returned
31 upon final determination of the charge against such person.
32 (2) In the event the person stopped deposits a valid Kansas driver's
33 license with the police officer and fails to appear in the district court on the
34 date set for appearance, or any continuance thereof, and in any event
35 within 30 days from the date set for the original hearing, the court shall

HB 2393 2
1 forward such person's driver's license to the division of vehicles with an
2 appropriate explanation attached thereto. Upon receipt of such person's
3 driver's license, the division shall suspend such person's privilege to
4 operate a motor vehicle in this state until such person appears before the
5 court having jurisdiction of the offense charged, the court makes a final
6 disposition thereof and notice of such disposition is given by the court to
7 the division. No new or replacement license shall be issued to any such
8 person until such notice of disposition has been received by the division.
9 The provisions of K.S.A. 8-256, and amendments thereto, limiting the
10 suspension of a license to one year, shall not apply to suspensions for
11 failure to appear as provided in this subsection.
12 (b) No person shall apply for a replacement or new driver's license
13 prior to the return of such person's original license which has been
14 deposited in lieu of bond under this section. Violation of this subsection is
15 a class C misdemeanor. The division may suspend such person's driver's
16 license for a period of not to exceed one year from the date the division
17 receives notice of the disposition of the person's charge as provided in
18 subsection (a).
19 (c) (1) In lieu of depositing a valid Kansas driver's license with the
20 stopping police officer as provided in subsection (a), the person stopped
21 may elect to give bond in the amount specified in subsection (d) for the
22 offense for which the person was stopped. When such person does not
23 have a valid Kansas driver's license, such person shall give such bond.
24 Such bond shall be subject to forfeiture if the person stopped does not
25 appear at the court and at the time specified in the written notice provided
26 for in K.S.A. 8-2106, and amendments thereto.
27 (2) Such bond may be a cash bond, a bank card draft from any valid
28 and unexpired credit card approved by the division of vehicles or
29 superintendent of the Kansas highway patrol or a guaranteed arrest bond
30 certificate issued by either a surety company authorized to transact such
31 business in this state or an automobile club authorized to transact business
32 in this state by the commissioner of insurance. If any of the approved bank
33 card issuers redeem the bank card draft at a discounted rate, such discount
34 shall be charged against the amount designated as the fine for the offense.
35 If such bond is not forfeited, the amount of the bond less the discount rate
36 shall be reimbursed to the person providing the bond by the use of a bank
37 card draft. Any such guaranteed arrest bond certificate shall be signed by
38 the person to whom it is issued and shall contain a printed statement that
39 such surety company or automobile club guarantees the appearance of
40 such person and will, in the event of failure of such person to appear in
41 court at the time of trial, pay any fine or forfeiture imposed on such person
42 not to exceed an amount to be stated on such certificate.
43 (3) Such cash bond shall be taken in the following manner: The

HB 2393 3
1 police officer shall furnish the person stopped a stamped envelope
2 addressed to the judge or clerk of the court named in the written notice to
3 appear and the person shall place in such envelope the amount of the bond,
4 and in the presence of the police officer shall deposit the same in the
5 United States mail. After such cash payment, the person stopped need not
6 sign the written notice to appear, but the police officer shall note the
7 amount of the bond mailed on the notice to appear form and shall give a
8 copy of such form to the person. If the person stopped furnishes the police
9 officer with a guaranteed arrest bond certificate or bank card draft, the
10 police officer shall give such person a receipt therefor and shall note the
11 amount of the bond on the notice to appear form and give a copy of such
12 form to the person stopped. Such person need not sign the written notice to
13 appear, and the police officer shall present the notice to appear and the
14 guaranteed arrest bond certificate or bank card draft to the court having
15 jurisdiction of the offense charged as soon as reasonably possible.
16 (d) The offenses for which appearance bonds may be required as
17 provided in subsection (c) and the amounts thereof shall be as follows:
18 On and after July 1, 1996:
19 Reckless driving...................................................................................... $82

28 beverage accessible while vehicle in motion..................................... 223
29 (e) In the event of forfeiture of any bond under this section, $75 of
30 the amount forfeited shall be regarded as a docket fee in any court having
31 jurisdiction over the violation of state law.
32 (f) None of the provisions of this section shall be construed to
33 conflict with the provisions of the nonresident violator compact.
34 (g) When a person is stopped by a police officer for any traffic
35 infraction and the person is a resident of a state which is not a member of
36 the nonresident violator compact, K.S.A. 8-1219 et seq., and amendments
37 thereto, or the person is licensed to drive under the laws of a foreign
38 country, the police officer may require a bond as provided for under
39 subsection (c). The bond shall be in the amount specified in the uniform
40 fine schedule in K.S.A. 8-2118(c), and amendments thereto, plus $75
41 which shall be regarded as a docket fee in any court having jurisdiction
42 over the violation of state law.
43 (h) When a person is stopped by a police officer for failure to provide

HB 2393 4
1 proof of financial security pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3104, and amendments
2 thereto, and the person is a resident of another state or the person is
3 licensed to drive under the laws of a foreign country, the police officer
4 may require a bond as provided for under subsection (c). The bond shall be
5 in the amount of $75, plus $75 which shall be regarded as a docket fee in
6 any court having jurisdiction over the violation of state law.
7 (i) Except as provided further, the docket fee established in this
8 section shall be the only fee collected or moneys in the nature of a fee
9 collected for the docket fee. Such fee shall only be established by an act of
10 the legislature and no other authority is established by law or otherwise to
11 collect a fee. On and after July 1, 2019 2025, through June 30, 2025 2030,
12 the supreme court may impose an additional charge, not to exceed $22 per
13 docket fee, to fund the costs of non-judicial personnel.
14 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-2110 is hereby amended to read as
15 follows: 8-2110. (a) Failure to comply with a traffic citation means failure
16 either to: (1) Appear before any district or municipal court in response to a
17 traffic citation and pay any fine and court costs imposed as ordered by the
18 court; or (2) otherwise comply with a traffic citation as provided in K.S.A.
19 8-2118, and amendments thereto. Failure to comply with a traffic citation
20 is a misdemeanor, regardless of the disposition of the charge for which
21 such citation was originally issued.
22 (b) (1) (A) In addition to penalties of law applicable under subsection
23 (a), when a person fails to comply with a traffic citation, except for any
24 violations provided in subparagraph (C), the district or municipal court in
25 which the person should have complied with the citation shall mail notice
26 to the person that if the person does not appear in district or municipal
27 court or pay fines, court costs and any penalties as ordered by the court
28 within 30 days from the date of mailing notice, the division of vehicles
29 will be notified to suspend the person's driving privileges unless such
30 person is eligible for restricted driving privileges pursuant to subparagraph
31 (B). If the person is eligible for restricted driving privileges, the division of
32 vehicles shall restrict such person's driving privileges pursuant to the terms
33 set forth in subparagraph (B). The district or municipal court may charge
34 an additional fee of $5 for mailing such notice. Upon the person's failure to
35 comply within such 30 days of mailing notice, the district or municipal
36 court shall electronically notify the division of vehicles unless the district
37 or municipal court has determined pursuant to a written order that the
38 person shall fulfill any requirements set forth by the court prior to the
39 suspension. Failure to abide by the terms of the order shall result in the
40 court notifying the division of vehicles that the person's license shall be
41 suspended for the failure to comply with a traffic citation. Upon receipt of
42 a report of a failure to comply with a traffic citation under this subsection,
43 pursuant to K.S.A. 8-255, and amendments thereto, the division of

HB 2393 5
1 vehicles shall notify the violator and suspend the license of the violator
2 until satisfactory evidence of substantial compliance with the terms of the
3 traffic citation has been furnished to the informing court unless such
4 person is eligible for restricted driving privileges pursuant to subparagraph
5 (B). If the person is eligible for restricted driving privileges, the division of
6 vehicles shall notify the violator that the person's driving privileges are
7 restricted pursuant to the terms set forth in subparagraph (B). When the
8 court determines the person is in substantial compliance with the terms of
9 the traffic citation, the court shall immediately electronically notify the
10 division of vehicles of such compliance. Upon receipt of notification of
11 such compliance from the informing court, the division of vehicles shall
12 terminate the restriction, suspension or suspension action.
13 (B) (i) When restricted driving privileges are approved pursuant to
14 this subsection, the person's driving privileges shall be restricted to driving

32 such person is suspended for reasons other than a failure to comply with a
33 traffic citation at the time of application. Restricted driving privileges
34 approved pursuant to this subparagraph shall remain in effect for the lesser
35 of time of either:
36 (a) 60 days from the date that the division of vehicles mails notice to
37 the person of the restricted driving privileges;

20 in which the person should have complied with the citation that led to a
21 prior violation of this section. If the court determines that the person
22 committed an offense that does not provide the basis for a violation of this

36 subsection (c) may petition the court that assessed the fee at any time to
37 waive payment of the fee, any additional charge imposed pursuant to
38 subsection (f), or any portion thereof. If it appears to the satisfaction of the

40 person or the person's immediate family, the court may waive payment of
41 all or part of the amount due or modify the method of payment.
42 (2) A person who is assessed a fine or court costs for a traffic citation
43 may petition the court that assessed the fine or costs at any time to waive

HB 2393 9
1 payment of the fine or costs, or any portion thereof. If it appears to the
2 satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose

15 exceed $22 per reinstatement fee, to fund the costs of non-judicial
16 personnel.
17 (g) (1) Prior to issuing an order pursuant to this section that notifies
18 the division of vehicles to restrict or suspend a person's driving privileges,

21 for payment plans for any fees, fines and court costs; and
22 (B) alternative requirements in lieu of restriction or suspension of
23 driving privileges, including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug treatment

32 division shall notify by mail any persons whose driving privileges were
33 suspended or restricted and have not since been restored. The division
34 shall notify the person that the person may be eligible for driving
35 privileges as a result of the expiration of the five years from the conviction
36 for the failure to comply.
37 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall be construed and applied

42 substantially in making payments or satisfying the terms of the court order.

2 shall impart notice of the pendency of the action and shall result in the
3 same lien rights as if the action were pending in that county. The lien shall
4 be effective from the time the statement is filed, but not to exceed four
5 months prior to the entry of judgment except as provided in subsection (c)
6 (b). The party filing such notice shall within 30 days after any satisfaction
7 of the judgment entered in such action, or any other final disposition
8 thereof, cause to be filed with such clerk of the district court a notice that
9 all claims in such action are released. If the party filing fails or neglects to
10 do so after reasonable demand by any party in interest, such party shall be
11 liable in damages in the same amounts and manner as is provided by law
12 for failure of a mortgagee to enter satisfaction of a mortgage. Upon the
13 filing of such a notice of the pendency of an action the clerk shall charge a
14 fee of $14 and shall enter and index the action in the same manner as for
15 the filing of an original action. Upon the filing of a notice of release, the
16 notice shall likewise be entered on the docket. Except as provided further,
17 the fee established in this subsection shall be the only fee collected or
18 moneys in the nature of a fee collected for the court procedure. Such fee
19 shall only be established by an act of the legislature and no other authority
20 is established by law or otherwise to collect a fee. On and after July 1,
21 2019 2025, through June 30, 2025 2030, the supreme court may impose an
22 additional charge, not to exceed $22 per fee, to fund the costs of non-
23 judicial personnel.
24 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the
25 filing of a notice of the pendency of an action pursuant to subsection (a)
26 shall create no lien rights against the property of an employee of the state
27 or a municipality prior to the date judgment is rendered if the pleadings in
28 the pending action allege a negligent or wrongful act or omission of the
29 employee while acting within the scope of such employee's employment,
30 regardless of whether or not it is alleged in the alternative that the
31 employee was acting outside of such employee's employment. A judgment
32 against an employee shall become a lien upon such employee's property in
33 the county where notice is filed pursuant to subsection (a) when the
34 judgment is rendered only if it is found that: (1) The employee's negligent
35 or wrongful act or omission occurred when the employee was acting
36 outside the scope of such employee's employment; or (2) the employee's
37 conduct which gave rise to the judgment was because of actual fraud or
38 actual malice of the employee. In such cases the lien shall not be effective
39 prior to the date judgment was rendered. As used in this subsection (c),
40 "employee" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in K.S.A. 75-
41 6102, and amendments thereto.
42 Sec. 20. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 61-2704 is hereby amended to read as
43 follows: 61-2704. (a) An action seeking the recovery of a small claim shall

HB 2393 39
1 be considered to have been commenced at the time a person files a written
2 statement of the person's small claim with the clerk of the court if, within
3 90 days after the small claim is filed, service of process is obtained or the
4 first publication is made for service by publication. Otherwise, the action
5 is deemed commenced at the time of service of process or first publication.
6 An entry of appearance shall have the same effect as service.
7 (b) Upon the filing of a plaintiff's small claim, the clerk of the court
8 shall require from the plaintiff a docket fee of $35 if the claim does not
9 exceed $500; or $55 if the claim exceeds $500; unless for good cause
10 shown the judge waives the fee. The docket fee shall be the only costs
11 required in an action seeking recovery of a small claim. No person may
12 file more than 20 small claims under this act in the same court during any
13 calendar year.
14 (c) Except as provided further, the docket fee established in this
15 section shall be the only fee collected or moneys in the nature of a fee
16 collected for the docket fee. Such fee shall only be established by an act of
17 the legislature and no other authority is established by law or otherwise to
18 collect a fee. On and after July 1, 2019 2025, through June 30, 2025 2030,
19 the supreme court may impose an additional charge, not to exceed $12.50
20 per docket fee, to fund the costs of non-judicial personnel.
21 Sec. 21. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 61-4001 is hereby amended to read as
22 follows: 61-4001. (a) Docket fee. (1) No case shall be filed or docketed
23 pursuant to the code of civil procedure for limited actions without the
24 payment of a docket fee in the amount of $35 if the amount in controversy
25 or claimed does not exceed $500; $55 if the amount in controversy or
26 claimed exceeds $500 but does not exceed $5,000; or $101 if the amount
27 in controversy or claimed exceeds $5,000. If judgment is rendered for the
28 plaintiff, the court also may enter judgment for the plaintiff for the amount
29 of the docket fee paid by the plaintiff.
30 (2) Except as provided further, the docket fee established in this
31 section shall be the only fee collected or moneys in the nature of a fee
32 collected for the docket fee. Such fee shall only be established by an act of
33 the legislature and no other authority is established by law or otherwise to
34 collect a fee. On and after July 1, 2019 2025, through June 30, 2025 2030,
35 the supreme court may impose an additional charge, not to exceed $19 per
36 docket fee, to fund the costs of non-judicial personnel.
37 (b) Poverty affidavit; additional court costs; exemptions for the state
38 and municipalities. The provisions of K.S.A. 60-2001(b), (c) and (d) and
39 60-2005, and amendments thereto, shall be applicable to lawsuits brought
40 under the code of civil procedure for limited actions.
41 Sec. 22. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 65-409 is hereby amended to read as
42 follows: 65-409. (a) The clerk of the district court shall charge a fee of $14
43 for entering and filing a lien statement under this act.

HB 2393 40
1 (b) Except as provided further, the lien fee established in subsection
2 (a) shall be the only fee collected or moneys in the nature of a fee collected
3 for such lien. Such fee shall only be established by an act of the legislature
4 and no other authority is established by law or otherwise to collect a fee.
5 On and after July 1, 2019 2025, through June 30, 2025 2030, the supreme
6 court may impose an additional charge, not to exceed $22 per lien fee, to
7 fund the costs of non-judicial personnel.
8 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 8-2107, 20-3021, 21-6614, 22-2410, 23-2510, 28-
9 170, 28-172a, 28-179, 38-2215, 38-2312 and 38-2314 and K.S.A. 2024
10 Supp. 8-2110, 28-177, 28-178, 32-1049a, 59-104, 60-729, 60-2001, 60-
11 2203a, 61-2704, 61-4001 and 65-409 are hereby repealed.
12 Sec. 24. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
13 publication in the statute book.
