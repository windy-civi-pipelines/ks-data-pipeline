Senate Substitute for HOUSE BILL No. 2228
By Committee on Judiciary
3-19
1 AN ACT concerning contingent fee contracts for legal services; relating to
2 contracts entered into for legal services by a political subdivision;
3 requiring an open meeting before a political subdivision may approve
4 such a contract; requiring the attorney general to approve such contract
5 before such contract becomes effective.
6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. (a) A political subdivision may only enter into a contingent
9 fee contract for legal services if the governing body of the political
10 subdivision:
11 (1) Calls a meeting for the purpose of considering the contract and
12 provides, in the notice or agenda of the meeting issued pursuant to K.S.A.
13 75-4318, and amendments thereto, the:
14 (A) Reasons for pursuing the matter that is the subject of the legal
15 services of which the attorney or law firm would be retained and the
16 desired outcome of pursuing the matter;
17 (B) qualifications, experience and competence of the attorney or law
18 firm selected or considered for selection by the governing body;
19 (C) nature of any relationship, regardless of how short, between the
20 political subdivision or governing body and the attorney or law firm that is
21 a party to the contract;
22 (D) reasons the legal services cannot be adequately performed by the
23 attorneys and supporting personnel of the political subdivision;
24 (E) reasons the legal services cannot be reasonably obtained from
25 attorneys under a contract providing for an hourly rate payment structure
26 as opposed to a contingency fee structure; and
27 (F) reasons entering into a contingent fee contract for legal services is
28 in the best interest of the residents of the political subdivision;
29 (2) makes a finding, in writing, that:
30 (A) It is in the best interest of the residents of the political subdivision
31 to contract for the legal services or there is a substantial need for the legal
32 services that are the subject of the contingent fee contract;
33 (B) the legal services cannot be adequately performed by the
34 attorneys and supporting personnel of the political subdivision; and
35 (C) the legal services cannot reasonably be obtained from attorneys
36 under a contract providing for an hourly rate payment structure because

HB 2228 2
1 the nature of the legal matter that is the subject of the contract or the
2 political subdivision does not have the funds necessary or would pay
3 substantially more for the legal services provided under a contract
4 providing for an hourly rate payment structure; and
5 (3) approves the contract in an open meeting after discussion and
6 consideration of the items described in paragraph (1).
7 (b) (1) Before a contingency fee contract for legal services approved
8 by a political subdivision pursuant to subsection (a) is effective and
9 enforceable, the political subdivision shall obtain approval of the contract
10 by the attorney general. The political subdivision shall provide to the
11 attorney general:
12 (A) A copy of the proposed contract;
13 (B) a description of the legal matter that is the subject of the proposed
14 contract;
15 (C) a copy of the notice and agenda issued pursuant to subsection (a)
16 (1), the date such notice was issued and a description of the method for
17 providing such notice; and
18 (D) a copy of the written findings made pursuant to subsection (a)(2).
19 (2) Within 45 days after the political subdivision has provided the
20 attorney general with the information described in paragraph (1), the
21 attorney general shall:
22 (A) Approve the contract and, if the request involves a matter of
23 purely local concern that does not implicate any statewide interest, shall do
24 so promptly; or
25 (B) refuse to approve the contract for one of the following reasons:
26 (i) The legal matter that is the subject of the contract presents one or
27 more questions of law or fact that are in common with a lawsuit, demand
28 or settlement asserting or resolving claims that the state has already
29 addressed or is pursuing in court;
30 (ii) the legal matter involves claims or issues that are more
31 appropriately within the scope of state enforcement and the pursuit of the
32 matter independently by the political subdivision could lead to inconsistent
33 legal outcomes or undermine the state's unified position; or
34 (iii) the contract does not comply with the Kansas rules of
35 professional conduct for attorneys adopted by the Kansas supreme court.
36 (3) If the attorney general refuses to approve the contract, the attorney
37 general shall provide notice to the political subdivision in writing with a
38 detailed explanation of the reason for refusing to approve the contract. If
39 the attorney general has not taken action and provided the political
40 subdivision notice of such action on a contract pursuant to paragraph (2)
41 within 45 days after receipt of such notice, such contract shall be deemed
42 approved.
43 (c) In any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding in which a political

HB 2228 3
1 subdivision is represented by an attorney providing legal services under a
2 contingent fee contract for legal services that does not comply with the
3 provisions of this section, the attorney general may appear in such
4 proceeding and request that the proceeding be dismissed or intervene and
5 recover damages on behalf of the political subdivision. If the court or
6 quasi-judicial body concludes that the contract for legal services does not
7 comply with the provisions of this section, the court or quasi-judicial body
8 shall dismiss the matter without prejudice or allow the attorney general to
9 intervene on behalf of the political subdivision.
10 (d) Any contingent fee contract for legal services that was entered
11 into by a political subdivision between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, shall
12 be submitted to the attorney general by the political subdivision on or
13 before July 1, 2026. The attorney general may review the contract and
14 approve or refuse to approve the contract pursuant to subsection (b). Any
15 judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding that is ongoing involving a contingent
16 fee contract for legal services entered into by a political subdivision shall
17 proceed unless the attorney general appears in such proceeding as
18 described in subsection (c).

21 of the matter for which the service is rendered;
