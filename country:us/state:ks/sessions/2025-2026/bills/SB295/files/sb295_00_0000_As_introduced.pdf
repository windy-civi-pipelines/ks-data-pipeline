18 or assignment to a community correctional services program ordered

22 21-6604(b), and amendments thereto;
23 (2) (A) pay a correctional supervision fee of $60 if the person was
24 convicted of a misdemeanor or a fee of $120 if the person was convicted

1 (3) reimburse the state general fund for all or a part of the
2 expenditures by the state board of indigents' defense services to provide
3 counsel and other defense services to the defendant. In determining the
4 amount and method of payment of such sum, the court shall take account
5 of the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that
6 payment of such sum will impose. A defendant who has been required to
7 pay such sum and who is not willfully in default in the payment thereof
8 may at any time petition the court which that sentenced the defendant to
9 waive payment of such sum or of any unpaid portion thereof. If it appears
10 to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose
11 manifest hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate family,
12 the court may waive payment of all or part of the amount due or modify
13 the method of payment. The amount of attorney fees to be included in the
14 court order for reimbursement shall be the amount claimed by appointed
15 counsel on the payment voucher for indigents' defense services or the
16 amount prescribed by the board of indigents' defense services
17 reimbursement tables as provided in K.S.A. 22-4522, and amendments
18 thereto, whichever is less.
19 (d) The court shall not impose any condition of probation, suspension
20 of sentence or assignment to a community correctional services program
21 that prohibits the defendant from using marijuana as defined in section 1,

23 use would create a danger to the defendant or another person. A
24 marijuana infraction as described in section 1, and amendments thereto,

26 violation of a condition of probation, suspension of sentence or
27 assignment to a community correctional services program.

29 corrections shall collaborate to develop documentation related to

27 (A) and (B) may be reduced by up to 12 months and the period of
28 postrelease supervision provided in subparagraph (C) may be reduced by

15 the purposes for which the defendant committed the crime was for the
16 purpose of the defendant's sexual gratification.
17 (e) If an inmate is sentenced to imprisonment for a crime committed
18 while on parole or conditional release, the inmate shall be eligible for
19 parole as provided by subsection (c), except that the prisoner review board
20 may postpone the inmate's parole eligibility date by assessing a penalty not
21 exceeding the period of time which that could have been assessed if the
22 inmate's parole or conditional release had been violated for reasons other
23 than conviction of a crime.
24 (f) If a person is sentenced to prison for a crime committed on or after
25 July 1, 1993, while on probation, parole, conditional release or in a
26 community corrections program, for a crime committed prior to July 1,
27 1993, and the person is not eligible for retroactive application of the
28 sentencing guidelines and amendments thereto pursuant to K.S.A. 21-
29 4724, prior to its repeal, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the
30 old sentence, but shall begin when the person is paroled or reaches the
31 conditional release date on the old sentence. If the offender was past the
32 offender's conditional release date at the time the new offense was
33 committed, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the old sentence
34 but shall begin when the person is ordered released by the prisoner review
35 board or reaches the maximum sentence expiration date on the old
36 sentence, whichever is earlier. The new sentence shall then be served as
37 otherwise provided by law. The period of postrelease supervision shall be
38 based on the new sentence, except that those offenders whose old sentence
39 is a term of imprisonment for life, imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 1993 Supp.
40 21-4628, prior to its repeal, or an indeterminate sentence with a maximum

SB 295 15
1 review board.
2 (g) Subject to the provisions of this section, the prisoner review board
3 may release on parole those persons confined in institutions who are
4 eligible for parole when: (1) The board believes that the inmate should be
5 released for hospitalization, deportation or to answer the warrant or other
6 process of a court and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability
7 that the inmate can be released without detriment to the community or to
8 the inmate; or (2) the secretary of corrections has reported to the board in
9 writing that the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required
10 by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments
11 thereto, or any revision of such agreement, and the board believes that the
12 inmate is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law abiding citizen
13 and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability that the inmate
14 can be released without detriment to the community or to the inmate.
15 Parole shall not be granted as an award of clemency and shall not be
16 considered a reduction of sentence or a pardon.
17 (h) The prisoner review board shall hold a parole hearing at least the
18 month prior to the month an inmate will be eligible for parole under
19 subsections (a), (b) and (c). At least one month preceding the parole
20 hearing, the county or district attorney of the county where the inmate was
21 convicted shall give written notice of the time and place of the public
22 comment sessions for the inmate to any victim of the inmate's crime who
23 is alive and whose address is known to the county or district attorney or, if
24 the victim is deceased, to the victim's family if the family's address is
25 known to the county or district attorney. Except as otherwise provided,
26 failure to notify pursuant to this section shall not be a reason to postpone a
27 parole hearing. In the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
28 a class A felony, the secretary of corrections shall give written notice of the
29 time and place of the public comment session for such inmate at least one
30 month preceding the public comment session to any victim of such
31 inmate's crime or the victim's family pursuant to K.S.A. 74-7338, and
32 amendments thereto. If notification is not given to such victim or such
33 victim's family in the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
34 a class A felony, the board shall postpone a decision on parole of the
35 inmate to a time at least 30 days after notification is given as provided in
36 this section. Nothing in this section shall create a cause of action against
37 the state or an employee of the state acting within the scope of the
38 employee's employment as a result of the failure to notify pursuant to this
39 section. If granted parole, the inmate may be released on parole on the date
40 specified by the board, but not earlier than the date the inmate is eligible
41 for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At each parole hearing and, if
42 parole is not granted, at such intervals thereafter as it determines
43 appropriate, the board shall consider:

SB 295 16
1 (1) Whether the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs
2 required by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and
3 amendments thereto, or any revision of such agreement; and
4 (2) all pertinent information regarding such inmate, including, but not
5 limited to, the circumstances of the offense of the inmate; the presentence
6 report; the previous social history and criminal record of the inmate; the
7 conduct, employment, and attitude of the inmate in prison; the reports of
8 such physical and mental examinations as have been made, including, but
9 not limited to, risk factors revealed by any risk assessment of the inmate;
10 comments of the victim and the victim's family including in person
11 comments, contemporaneous comments and prerecorded comments made
12 by any technological means; comments of the public; official comments;
13 any recommendation by the staff of the facility where the inmate is
14 incarcerated; proportionality of the time the inmate has served to the
15 sentence a person would receive under the Kansas sentencing guidelines
16 for the conduct that resulted in the inmate's incarceration; and capacity of
17 state correctional institutions.
18 (i) In those cases involving inmates sentenced for a crime committed
19 after July 1, 1993, the prisoner review board will review the inmate's
20 proposed release plan. The board may schedule a hearing if they desire.
21 The board may impose any condition they deem necessary to insure public
22 safety, aid in the reintegration of the inmate into the community, or items
23 not completed under the agreement entered into under K.S.A. 75-5210a,
24 and amendments thereto. The board may not advance or delay an inmate's
25 release date. Every inmate while on postrelease supervision shall remain in
26 the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders
27 of the secretary.
28 (j) (1) Before ordering the parole of any inmate, the prisoner review
29 board shall have the inmate appear either in person or via a video
30 conferencing format and shall interview the inmate unless impractical
31 because of the inmate's physical or mental condition or absence from the
32 institution. Every inmate while on parole shall remain in the legal custody
33 of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary.
34 Whenever the board formally considers placing an inmate on parole and
35 no agreement has been entered into with the inmate under K.S.A. 75-
36 5210a, and amendments thereto, the board shall notify the inmate in
37 writing of the reasons for not granting parole. If an agreement has been
38 entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the inmate
39 has not satisfactorily completed the programs specified in the agreement,
40 or any revision of such agreement, the board shall notify the inmate in
41 writing of the specific programs that the inmate must satisfactorily
42 complete before parole will be granted. If parole is not granted only
43 because of a failure to satisfactorily complete such programs, the board

SB 295 17
1 shall grant parole upon the secretary's certification that the inmate has
2 successfully completed such programs. If an agreement has been entered
3 under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the secretary of
4 corrections has reported to the board in writing that the inmate has
5 satisfactorily completed the programs required by such agreement, or any
6 revision thereof, the board shall not require further program participation.
7 However, if the board determines that other pertinent information
8 regarding the inmate warrants the inmate's not being released on parole,
9 the board shall state in writing the reasons for not granting the parole. If
10 parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a crime other than a class A or
11 class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole
12 hearing for the inmate not later than one year after the denial unless the
13 board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted
14 at a hearing if held in the next three years or during the interim period of a
15 deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for
16 up to three years but any such deferral by the board shall require the board
17 to state the basis for its findings. If parole is denied for an inmate
18 sentenced for a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board
19 shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than three years
20 after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect
21 that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next 10 years or
22 during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer
23 subsequent parole hearings for up to 10 years, but any such deferral shall
24 require the board to state the basis for its findings.
25 (2) Inmates sentenced for a class A or class B felony who have not
26 had a board hearing in the five years prior to July 1, 2010, shall have such
27 inmates' cases reviewed by the board on or before July 1, 2012. Such
28 review shall begin with the inmates with the oldest deferral date and
29 progress to the most recent. Such review shall be done utilizing existing
30 resources unless the board determines that such resources are insufficient.
31 If the board determines that such resources are insufficient, then the
32 provisions of this paragraph are subject to appropriations therefor.
33 (k) (1) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision shall be
34 assigned, upon release, to the appropriate level of supervision pursuant to
35 the criteria established by the secretary of corrections.
36 (2) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
37 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
38 effects, vehicle, residence and property by a parole officer or a department
39 of corrections enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any
40 time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or
41 without cause. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize
42 such officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the
43 sole purpose of harassment.

SB 295 18
1 (3) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
2 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
3 effects, vehicle, residence and property by any law enforcement officer
4 based on reasonable suspicion of the person violating conditions of parole
5 or postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Any
6 law enforcement officer who conducts such a search shall submit a written
7 report to the appropriate parole officer no later than the close of the next
8 business day after such search. The written report shall include the facts
9 leading to such search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting
10 from such search.
11 (l) The prisoner review board shall promulgate rules and regulations
12 in accordance with K.S.A. 77-415 et seq., and amendments thereto, not
13 inconsistent with the law and as it may deem proper or necessary, with
14 respect to the conduct of parole hearings, postrelease supervision reviews,
15 revocation hearings, orders of restitution, reimbursement of expenditures
16 by the state board of indigents' defense services and other conditions to be
17 imposed upon parolees or releasees. Whenever an order for parole or
18 postrelease supervision is issued it shall recite the conditions thereof.
19 (m) Whenever the prisoner review board orders the parole of an
20 inmate or establishes conditions for an inmate placed on postrelease
21 supervision, the board shall require that the inmate:
22 (1) Obey all laws and ordinances and report any law enforcement
23 contact to the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after such
24 contact;
25 (2) not engage in physical violence or threats of violence of any kind
26 and, if the inmate is being supervised for conviction of a felony, not
27 purchase or possess a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, while on
28 supervision;
29 (3) report to the inmate's supervision officer as directed and be
30 truthful in all matters;
31 (4) remain within the state of Kansas or other specified areas as
32 defined by the defendant's supervision officer;
33 (5) reside at the inmate's approved residence unless the defendant
34 receives permission from the inmate's supervision officer to relocate and
35 notify the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after any emergency
36 changes in residence or contact information;
37 (6) except as provided in subsection (n), not possess, use or distribute
38 any controlled substances except those prescribed by a licensed medical
39 professional;
40 (7) not possess or consume any form of alcohol or intoxicating
41 substance or enter any establishment where alcohol is sold or consumed as
42 the primary business;
43 (8) submit to any form of alcohol or substance use testing directed by

SB 295 19
1 the inmate's supervision officer and not alter or tamper with the specimen
2 or test;
3 (9) participate in assessment, treatment, programming and other
4 directives of the court or the inmate's supervision officer;
5 (10) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
6 residence and property by a parole officer or a department of corrections
7 enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any time of the day
8 or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause,
9 except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize such
10 officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the sole
11 purpose of harassment;
12 (11) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
13 residence and property by any law enforcement officer based on
14 reasonable suspicion of the person violating conditions of parole or
15 postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity;
16 (12) refrain from contacting victims unless authorized by the board to
17 contact a victim as part of rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes;
18 (13) pay the administrative fee imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4529,
19 and amendments thereto, unless the board finds compelling circumstances
20 that would render payment unworkable; and
21 (14) unless the board finds compelling circumstances that would
22 render a plan of payment unworkable, reimburse the state for all or part of
23 the expenditures by the state board of indigents' defense services to
24 provide counsel and other defense services to the person. In determining
25 the amount and method of payment of such sum, the prisoner review board
26 shall take account of the financial resources of the person and the nature of
27 the burden that the payment of such sum will impose. Such amount shall
28 not exceed the amount claimed by appointed counsel on the payment
29 voucher for indigents' defense services or the amount prescribed by the
30 board of indigents' defense services reimbursement tables as provided in
31 K.S.A. 22-4522, and amendments thereto, whichever is less, minus any
32 previous payments for such services.
33 (n) The prisoner review board shall not impose any condition of
34 parole or postrelease supervision that prohibits the inmate from using
35 marijuana as defined in section 1, and amendments thereto, unless the
36 court makes a finding that marijuana use would create a danger to the
37 inmate or another person. A marijuana infraction as described in section
38 1, and amendments thereto, or a drug test that is positive for marijuana
39 shall not be considered as a violation of a condition of parole or
40 postrelease supervision.
41 (o) Any law enforcement officer who conducts a search pursuant to
42 subsection (m)(11) shall submit a written report to the inmate's parole
43 officer not later than the close of business the next day after such search is

SB 295 20
1 conducted. The written report shall include the facts leading to such
2 search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting from such
