35 (g) (1) If the court determines that there is probable cause under

37 shall further consider the following:
38 (A) Whether participation by the parents, guardians or legal
39 custodians in any prevention services would prevent or eliminate the need
40 for removal, and if so, the court shall inquire from the parent if such
41 parent is willing to participate in such services. The court shall not order
42 a parent to participate in prevention services over the objection of such
43 parent, except that a parent may have the opportunity to consult with

10 (3) This subsection shall apply to proceedings filed on and after

42 have the authority to require any person or entity agreeing to participate in
43 the plan to perform as set out in the plan. When the child is placed in the
Sub HB 2132 13
1 temporary custody of the secretary, the secretary shall have the
2 discretionary authority to place the child with a parent or to make other
3 suitable placement for the child. When the child is placed in the temporary
4 custody of the secretary and the child has been subjected to human
5 trafficking or aggravated human trafficking, as defined by K.S.A. 21-5426,
6 and amendments thereto, or commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as

26 visit, contact, harass or intimidate the child, other family members or
27 witnesses. Such restraining order shall be served by personal service
28 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2237(a), and amendments thereto, on any alleged
29 perpetrator to whom the order is directed.
30 (i)(j) (1) The court shall not enter the initial order removing a child
31 from the custody of a parent pursuant to this section unless the court first
32 finds probable cause that:
33 (A) (i) The child is likely to sustain harm if not immediately removed

40 prevent the unnecessary removal of the child from the child's home or that

43 If the child is placed in the custody of the secretary, upon making the order
Sub HB 2132 14
1 the court shall provide the secretary with a written copy.
2 (j)(k) If the court enters an order of temporary custody that provides
3 for placement of the child with a person other than the parent, the court
4 shall make a child support determination pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2277, and
5 amendments thereto.
6 (k)(l) For the purposes of this section, "harassing or intimidating" and
7 "harass or intimidate" includes, but is not limited to, utilizing any
