32 child may be placed in a secure facility, but the total amount of time that
33 the child may be held in such facility under this section and K.S.A. 38-
34 2242, and amendments thereto, shall not exceed 24 hours, excluding
35 Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days on which the office of the

39 and stated on the record.
40 (h)(i) If the court issues an order of temporary custody, the court may
41 also enter an order restraining any alleged perpetrator of physical, sexual,

13 child; and
14 (B) reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the family unit and
15 prevent the unnecessary removal of the child from the child's home or that
16 an emergency exists which that threatens the safety to the child.
17 (2) Such findings shall be included in any order entered by the court.
18 If the child is placed in the custody of the secretary, upon making the order
19 the court shall provide the secretary with a written copy.
20 (j)(k) If the court enters an order of temporary custody that provides
21 for placement of the child with a person other than the parent, the court
22 shall make a child support determination pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2277, and
23 amendments thereto.
24 (k)(l) For the purposes of this section, "harassing or intimidating" and
25 "harass or intimidate" includes, but is not limited to, utilizing any
26 electronic tracking system or acquiring tracking information to determine
27 the targeted person's location, movement or travel patterns.
28 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2202, 38-2234 and 38-2243 are hereby

15 (b) Motions. Motions may be made orally or in writing. The motion
16 shall state with particularity the grounds for the motion and shall state the
17 relief or order sought.
18 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2243 is hereby amended to read as
19 follows: 38-2243. (a) Upon notice and hearing, the court may issue an
20 order directing who shall have temporary custody and may modify the
21 order during the pendency of the proceedings as will best serve the child's
22 welfare.
23 (b) A hearing pursuant to this section shall be held within 72 hours,
24 excluding Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days on which the
25 office of the clerk of the court is not accessible, following a child having
26 been taken into protective custody.
27 (c) Whenever it is determined that a temporary custody hearing is
28 required, the court shall immediately set the time and place for the hearing.
29 Notice of a temporary custody hearing shall be given to all parties and
30 interested parties.
31 (d) Notice of the temporary custody hearing shall be given at least 24
32 hours prior to the hearing. The court may continue the hearing to afford the
33 24 hours prior notice or, with the consent of the party or interested party,
34 proceed with the hearing at the designated time. If an order of temporary
35 custody is entered and the parent or other person having custody of the
36 child has not been notified of the hearing, did not appear or waive
37 appearance and requests a rehearing, the court shall rehear the matter
38 without unnecessary delay.
39 (e) Oral notice may be used for giving notice of a temporary custody
40 hearing where there is insufficient time to give written notice. Oral notice
41 is completed upon filing a certificate of oral notice.
42 (f) Subject to subsection (g), the court may enter an order of
43 temporary custody after determining that there is probable cause to believe

HB 2132 10
1 that the:
2 (1) Child is dangerous to self or to others;
3 (2) child is not likely to be available within the jurisdiction of the
4 court for future proceedings;
5 (3) health or welfare of the child may be endangered without further

10 21-6422, and amendments thereto;
11 (5) child is experiencing a behavioral health crisis and is in need of
12 treatment; or
13 (6) child committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would
14 constitute a violation of K.S.A. 21-6419, and amendments thereto.
15 (g) (1) If the court determines that there is probable cause under
16 subsection (f), before entering an order of temporary custody, the court
17 shall further consider the following:
18 (A) Whether participation by the parents, guardians or legal
19 custodians in any prevention services would prevent or eliminate the need
20 for removal, and if so, the court shall inquire from the parent if such
21 parent is willing to participate in such services. The court shall not order
22 a parent to participate in prevention services over the objection of such
23 parent, except that a parent shall have the opportunity to consult with
24 counsel prior to deciding whether to agree to proposed prevention services
25 as a condition of having the child return to or remain in the care of the
26 parent; and
27 (B) whether the issuance of the temporary order of protection
28 directing the removal of a person or persons from the child's residence
29 would prevent the need for removal of the child.
30 (2) If the parent agrees to participate in prevention services identified
31 by the court under this subsection that would prevent or eliminate the need
32 for removal, the court shall place the child with such parent.
33 (h) (1) Whenever the court determines the necessity for an order of
34 temporary custody the court may place the child in the temporary custody
35 of:
36 (A) A parent or other person having custody of the child and may
37 enter a restraining order pursuant to subsection (h)(i);

42 (D) a shelter facility;
43 (E) a staff secure facility, notwithstanding any other provision of law,

HB 2132 11
1 if the child has been subjected to human trafficking or aggravated human
2 trafficking, as defined by K.S.A. 21-5426, and amendments thereto, or
3 commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as defined by K.S.A. 21-6422,
4 and amendments thereto, or the child committed an act which, if
5 committed by an adult, would constitute a violation of K.S.A. 21-6419,
6 and amendments thereto;
7 (F) after written authorization by a community mental health center, a
8 juvenile crisis intervention center, as described in K.S.A. 65-536, and
9 amendments thereto; or
10 (G) the secretary, if the child is 15 years of age or younger, or 16 or

16 secretary until the court finds the services are in place. The court shall
17 have the authority to require any person or entity agreeing to participate in
18 the plan to perform as set out in the plan. When the child is placed in the
19 temporary custody of the secretary, the secretary shall have the
20 discretionary authority to place the child with a parent or to make other
21 suitable placement for the child. When the child is placed in the temporary
22 custody of the secretary and the child has been subjected to human
23 trafficking or aggravated human trafficking, as defined by K.S.A. 21-5426,
24 and amendments thereto, or commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as
25 defined by K.S.A 21-6422, and amendments thereto, or the child
26 committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a
27 violation of K.S.A. 21-6419, and amendments thereto, the secretary shall
28 have the discretionary authority to place the child in a staff secure facility,
29 notwithstanding any other provision of law. When the child is presently
30 alleged, but not yet adjudicated to be a child in need of care solely
31 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2202(d)(9) or (d)(10), and amendments thereto, the
32 child may be placed in a secure facility, but the total amount of time that
33 the child may be held in such facility under this section and K.S.A. 38-
34 2242, and amendments thereto, shall not exceed 24 hours, excluding
35 Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and days on which the office of the
36 clerk of the court is not accessible. The order of temporary custody shall
37 remain in effect until modified or rescinded by the court or an adjudication
38 order is entered but not exceeding 60 days, unless good cause is shown
39 and stated on the record.
40 (h)(i) If the court issues an order of temporary custody, the court may
41 also enter an order restraining any alleged perpetrator of physical, sexual,
42 mental or emotional abuse of the child from residing in the child's home;
43 visiting, contacting, harassing or intimidating the child; or attempting to

HB 2132 12
1 visit, contact, harass or intimidate the child, other family members or
2 witnesses. Such restraining order shall be served by personal service
3 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2237(a), and amendments thereto, on any alleged
4 perpetrator to whom the order is directed.
5 (i)(j) (1) The court shall not enter the initial order removing a child
6 from the custody of a parent pursuant to this section unless the court first
7 finds probable cause that:
8 (A) (i) The child is likely to sustain harm if not immediately removed
9 from the home;
10 (ii) allowing the child to remain in home is contrary to the welfare of
11 the child; or
12 (iii) immediate placement of the child is in the best interest of the
13 child; and
14 (B) reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the family unit and
15 prevent the unnecessary removal of the child from the child's home or that
16 an emergency exists which that threatens the safety to the child.
17 (2) Such findings shall be included in any order entered by the court.
18 If the child is placed in the custody of the secretary, upon making the order
19 the court shall provide the secretary with a written copy.
20 (j)(k) If the court enters an order of temporary custody that provides
21 for placement of the child with a person other than the parent, the court
22 shall make a child support determination pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2277, and
23 amendments thereto.
24 (k)(l) For the purposes of this section, "harassing or intimidating" and
25 "harass or intimidate" includes, but is not limited to, utilizing any
26 electronic tracking system or acquiring tracking information to determine
27 the targeted person's location, movement or travel patterns.
28 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2202, 38-2234 and 38-2243 are hereby
29 repealed.
30 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
31 publication in the statute book.
