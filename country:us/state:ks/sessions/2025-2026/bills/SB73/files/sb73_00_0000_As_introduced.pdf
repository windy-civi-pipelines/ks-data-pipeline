12 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied and the total amount of the adopted
13 budget of expenditures by fund, along with itemized budget forms for each

16 within the time prescribed by K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments thereto.
17 All such budget information shall be filed electronically with the county

19 amount of tax to be levied authorized by law, a statement showing the
20 increased amount or tax levy rate voted, or a copy of the charter resolution
21 or ordinance making the change, shall be attached to the budget each year
22 the change is in effect. If any taxing subdivision does not present or file
23 such budget information with the county clerk by 5:00 p.m. on October 1,
24 then the county clerk shall use the previous year's budget information and
25 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied of such taxing subdivision.
26 (b) The county clerk shall make any reductions to the ad valorem tax
27 to be levied, compute the tax levy rates based on the final equalized
28 assessed valuation, and enter such on the budget certificate before attesting
29 the budget, except that with regard to levies made under K.S.A. 75-2551,
30 and amendments thereto, such levies shall be based upon the certified
31 preliminary abstract of property values submitted to the director of
32 property valuation pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1604, and amendments thereto.
33 Beginning in 2022, On or before December 31 each year, a copy of all
34 budgets for taxing subdivisions of the county, properly attested, shall be
35 filed with the director of accounts and reports, along with a copy of the tax
36 levy rate summary. All such budget information shall be filed
37 electronically with the director of accounts and reports.
38 (c) Each fund of the adopted budget certified to the county clerk in no
39 event shall exceed the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied and the
40 proposed expenditures of such fund in the proposed budget as originally
41 published. The governing body of each taxing subdivision shall not certify
42 an amount of ad valorem taxes to be levied that is in excess of any tax levy
43 rate or amount limitations or any aggregate tax levy limitations. The

SB 73 4
1 governing bodies, in fixing the amount may take into consideration and
2 make allowance for the taxes which may not be paid, except that such
3 allowance, however, shall not exceed by more than 5% the percentage of
4 delinquency for the preceding tax year.
5 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 79-1806 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2001 and 79-2930
