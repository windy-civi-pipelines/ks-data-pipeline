Section 1:
Session of 2025
By Committee on Health and Human Services
Requested by Representative Beuhler on behalf of the Kansas Chamber of
Commerce
2-4
1 AN ACT concerning health and healthcare; relating to advanced practice
2 registered nurses; enacting the advanced practice registered nurses
3 compact to provide interstate practice privileges.
4
5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
7 advanced practice registered nurse compact.
8 ARTICLE 1—FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE
9 (a) The party states find that:
10 (1) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of
11 compliance with advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) licensure
12 requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to
13 state APRN licensure laws;
14 (2) violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the
15 practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
16 (3) the expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced
17 communication and intervention technologies as part of our nation's
18 healthcare delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation
19 among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;
20 (4) new practice modalities and technology make compliance with
21 individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;
22 (5) the current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs
23 practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for healthcare
24 delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators and APRNs;
25 and
26 (6) uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states
27 promotes public safety and public health benefits and provides a
28 mechanism to increase access to care.
29 (b) The general purposes of this compact are to:
30 (1) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health
31 and safety;
32 (2) ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas
33 of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform
34 licensure requirements;
HB 2266 2
1 (3) facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the
2 areas of APRN regulation, investigation and adverse actions;
3 (4) promote compliance with laws governing APRN practice in each
4 jurisdiction;
5 (5) invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN
6 accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the
7 patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual
8 recognition of party state privileges to practice;
9 (6) decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN
10 licenses; and
11 (7) provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who meet
12 uniform licensure requirements.

18 nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state
19 where the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a

24 compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for
25 advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure
26 privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be

31 apply for a party state's single-state APRN license as provided under the
32 laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these
33 individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as
34 an APRN in any other party state.
35 ARTICLE 4—APPLICATIONS FOR APRN LICENSURE IN A PARTY
36 STATE
37 (a) Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing
38 board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated
39 licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the
40 holder of a licensed practical or vocational nursing license, a registered
41 nursing license or an advanced practice registered nursing license issued
42 by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or
43 multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse
HB 2266 7
1 action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege
2 held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in
3 an alternative program.
4 (b) An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the
5 home state, in only one party state at a time.
6 (c) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving
7 between two party states, the APRN shall apply for APRN licensure in the
8 new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state
9 shall be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules.
10 (1) The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in
11 primary state of residence.
12 (2) A multistate APRN license shall not be issued by the new home
13 state until the APRN provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary
14 state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable
15 requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home
16 state.
17 (d) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a
18 party state to a non-party state, the APRN multistate license issued by the
19 prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the
20 former home state.
21 ARTICLE 5—ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY
22 STATE LICENSING BOARDS
23 (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing
24 board shall have the authority to:
25 (1) Take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure
26 privilege to practice within that party state.
27 (A) Only the home state shall have power to take adverse action
28 against an APRN's license issued by the home state.
29 (B) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing
30 board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct that
31 occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had
32 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its
33 own state laws to determine appropriate action.
34 (2) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an
35 APRN's authority to practice within that party state.
36 (3) Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes
37 primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The
38 licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and
39 shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the
40 administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The
41 administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall
42 promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
43 (4) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
HB 2266 8
1 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of
2 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the
3 attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from
4 another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of
5 competent jurisdiction, according to that court's practice and procedure in
6 considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing
7 board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees
8 required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or
9 evidence are located.
10 (5) Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints
11 or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation
12 for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of
13 investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the
14 results in making licensure decisions.
15 (6) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected
16 APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from
17 any adverse action taken against that APRN.
18 (7) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party
19 state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for
20 taking such adverse action.
21 (b) If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN's
22 multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under
23 a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all encumbrances
24 have been removed from the APRN's multistate license. All home state
25 disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN's
26 multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN's multistate
27 licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of
28 the order.
29 (c) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that
30 participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
31 action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate
32 licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the
33 duration of the APRN's participation in an alternative program.
34 ARTICLE 6—COORDIANTED LICENSURE INFORMATION
35 SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
36 (a) All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure
37 information system of all APRNs, licensed registered nurses, licensed
38 practical nurses and vocational nurses. This system shall include
39 information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each APRN, as
40 submitted by party states, to assist in the coordinated administration of
41 APRN licensure and enforcement efforts.
42 (b) The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the
43 coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and
HB 2266 9
1 proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of
2 information under this compact.
3 (c) All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated
4 licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant
5 investigative information, denials of applications, with the reasons for such
6 denials, and APRN participation in alternative programs known to the
7 licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed
8 nonpublic or confidential under state law.
9 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state
10 licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure
11 information system shall designate information that shall not be shared
12 with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without
13 the express permission of the contributing state.
14 (e) Any personally identifiable information obtained from the
15 coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board
16 shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or
17 individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state
18 contributing the information.
19 (f) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure
20 information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the
21 laws of the party state contributing the information shall be removed from
22 the coordinated licensure information system.

HB 2266 14
1 made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
2 commission employment, duties or responsibilities. Nothing in this
3 paragraph shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their

11 responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing
12 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
13 responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or omission
14 did not result from the intentional, willful or wanton misconduct of that
15 person.
16 ARTICLE 8—RULEMAKING
17 (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
18 the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules

21 this compact.
22 (b) Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or
23 special meeting of the commission.
24 (c) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the
25 commission, and at least 60 days in advance of the meeting at which the
26 rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice

30 otherwise publish proposed rules.
31 (d) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
32 (1) The proposed time, date and location of the meeting where the

37 person; and
38 (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the
39 commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written

42 approval of the commission.

5 (2) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
6 any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of
7 the commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding
8 for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission
9 shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact
10 or promulgated rules.
11 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.

21 membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote
22 of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits

25 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.

27 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
28 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
29 governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the
30 defaulting state's licensing board, the defaulting state's licensing board,
31 and each of the party states.

41 petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
42 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
43 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
HB 2266 17
1 reasonable attorney fees.
2 (c) Dispute resolution.
3 (1) Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to
4 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and
5 between party and non-party states.
6 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
7 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
8 (3) In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party
9 states arising under this compact:
10 (A) The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration
11 panel, which shall be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact
12 administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual
13 mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states
14 involved in the dispute.
15 (B) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and
16 binding.
17 (d) Enforcement.
18 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
19 enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
20 (2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the
21 United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
22 district where the commission has its principal offices against a party state
23 that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact
24 and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
25 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
26 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
27 including reasonable attorney fees.
28 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
29 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
30 under federal or state law.
31 ARTICLE 10—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
32 AMENDMENT
33 (a) This compact shall come into limited effect at such time as this
34 compact has been enacted into law in seven party states for the sole
35 purpose of establishing and convening the commission to adopt rules
36 relating to its operation.
37 (b) Any state that joins this compact subsequent to the commission's
38 initial adoption of the APRN uniform licensure requirements shall be
39 subject to all rules that have been previously adopted by the commission.
40 (c) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
41 statute repealing the same. A party state's withdrawal shall not take effect
42 until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.
43 (d) A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the
HB 2266 18
1 continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing
2 board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring
3 prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.
4 (e) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
5 or prevent any APRN licensure agreement or other cooperative
6 arrangement between a party state and a non-party state that does not
7 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
8 (f) This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment
9 to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any party state
10 until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.

12 invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting
13 basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.
14 ARTICLE 11—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
15 This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the
16 purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if
17 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be
18 contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if
19 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
20 circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact
21 and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
22 circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held to
23 be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain
24 in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and
25 effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.
26 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
27 publication in the statute book.

================================================================================

Raw Text:
Session of 2025
HOUSE BILL No. 2266
By Committee on Health and Human Services
Requested by Representative Beuhler on behalf of the Kansas Chamber of
Commerce
2-4
1 AN ACT concerning health and healthcare; relating to advanced practice
2 registered nurses; enacting the advanced practice registered nurses
3 compact to provide interstate practice privileges.
4
5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
7 advanced practice registered nurse compact.
8 ARTICLE 1—FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE
9 (a) The party states find that:
10 (1) The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of
11 compliance with advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) licensure
12 requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to
13 state APRN licensure laws;
14 (2) violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the
15 practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
16 (3) the expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced
17 communication and intervention technologies as part of our nation's
18 healthcare delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation
19 among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;
20 (4) new practice modalities and technology make compliance with
21 individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;
22 (5) the current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs
23 practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for healthcare
24 delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators and APRNs;
25 and
26 (6) uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states
27 promotes public safety and public health benefits and provides a
28 mechanism to increase access to care.
29 (b) The general purposes of this compact are to:
30 (1) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health
31 and safety;
32 (2) ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas
33 of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform
34 licensure requirements;

HB 2266 2
1 (3) facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the
2 areas of APRN regulation, investigation and adverse actions;
3 (4) promote compliance with laws governing APRN practice in each
4 jurisdiction;
5 (5) invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN
6 accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the
7 patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual
8 recognition of party state privileges to practice;
9 (6) decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN
10 licenses; and
11 (7) provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who meet
12 uniform licensure requirements.
13 ARTICLE 2—DEFINITIONS
14 As used in this compact:
15 (a) "Advanced practice registered nurse" or "APRN" means a
16 registered nurse who has gained additional specialized knowledge, skills
17 and experience through a program of study recognized or defined by the

23 criminal action permitted by a state's laws that is imposed by a licensing
24 board or other authority against an APRN, including actions against an

26 suspension, probation, monitoring of the licensee, limitation on the
27 licensee's practice or any other encumbrance on licensure affecting an
28 APRN's authorization to practice, including the issuance of a cease and
29 desist action.

43 investigative information that:

HB 2266 3
1 (1) A licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes
2 notification and an opportunity for the APRN to respond, if required by
3 state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would
4 indicate more than a minor infraction; or
5 (2) indicates that the APRN represents an immediate threat to public
6 health and safety regardless of whether the APRN has been notified and
7 had an opportunity to respond.
8 (h) "Encumbrance" means a revocation or suspension of, or any
9 limitation on, the full and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a

17 APRN issued by a home state licensing board that authorizes the APRN to
18 practice as an APRN in all party states under a multistate licensure
19 privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in
20 the home state.
21 (l) "Multistate licensure privilege" means a legal authorization
22 associated with an APRN multistate license that permits an APRN to
23 practice as an APRN in a remote state, in the same role and population
24 focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state.
25 (m) "Non-controlled prescription drug" means a device or drug that is
26 not a controlled substance and is prohibited under state or federal law from
27 being dispensed without a prescription. The term includes a device or drug

29 dispensing without prescription" or "prescription only" or other legend that
30 complies with federal law.
31 (n) "Party state" means any state that has adopted this compact.
32 (o) "Population focus" means one of the six population foci of family

26 approved role and at least one approved population focus.
27 (d) An APRN multistate license issued by a home state to a resident
28 in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing the

33 by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license, except that an
34 individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a multistate

36 failure of such an individual to affirmatively opt for a single state license
37 may result in the issuance of a multistate license.

39 authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs.
40 (g) For each state in which an APRN seeks authority to prescribe
41 controlled substances, the APRN shall satisfy all requirements imposed by

4 multistate licensure privilege.
5 (i) All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with state due
6 process laws, to take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure

11 licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated
12 licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state of any
13 such actions by remote states.
14 (j) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, an APRN
15 practicing in a party state shall comply with the state practice laws of the

17 practice is not limited to patient care, but shall include all advanced
18 nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state
19 where the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a
20 multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of
21 the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state where the
22 client is located at the time service is provided.
23 (k) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, this
24 compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for
25 advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure
26 privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be
27 recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for
28 registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice as
29 an APRN in that state.
30 (l) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to
31 apply for a party state's single-state APRN license as provided under the
32 laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these
33 individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as
34 an APRN in any other party state.
35 ARTICLE 4—APPLICATIONS FOR APRN LICENSURE IN A PARTY
36 STATE
37 (a) Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing
38 board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated
39 licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the
40 holder of a licensed practical or vocational nursing license, a registered
41 nursing license or an advanced practice registered nursing license issued
42 by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or
43 multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse

HB 2266 7
1 action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege
2 held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in
3 an alternative program.
4 (b) An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the
5 home state, in only one party state at a time.
6 (c) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving
7 between two party states, the APRN shall apply for APRN licensure in the
8 new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state
9 shall be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules.
10 (1) The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in
11 primary state of residence.
12 (2) A multistate APRN license shall not be issued by the new home
13 state until the APRN provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary
14 state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable
15 requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home
16 state.
17 (d) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a
18 party state to a non-party state, the APRN multistate license issued by the
19 prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the
20 former home state.
21 ARTICLE 5—ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN PARTY
22 STATE LICENSING BOARDS
23 (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing
24 board shall have the authority to:
25 (1) Take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure
26 privilege to practice within that party state.
27 (A) Only the home state shall have power to take adverse action
28 against an APRN's license issued by the home state.
29 (B) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing
30 board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct that
31 occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had
32 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its
33 own state laws to determine appropriate action.
34 (2) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an
35 APRN's authority to practice within that party state.
36 (3) Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes
37 primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The
38 licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and
39 shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the
40 administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The
41 administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall
42 promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
43 (4) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require

HB 2266 8
1 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of
2 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the
3 attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from
4 another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of
5 competent jurisdiction, according to that court's practice and procedure in
6 considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing
7 board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees
8 required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or
9 evidence are located.
10 (5) Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints
11 or other biometric-based information to the federal bureau of investigation
12 for criminal background checks, receive the results of the federal bureau of
13 investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the
14 results in making licensure decisions.
15 (6) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected
16 APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from
17 any adverse action taken against that APRN.
18 (7) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party
19 state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for
20 taking such adverse action.
21 (b) If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN's
22 multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under
23 a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all encumbrances
24 have been removed from the APRN's multistate license. All home state
25 disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN's
26 multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN's multistate
27 licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of
28 the order.
29 (c) Nothing in this compact shall override a party state's decision that
30 participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
31 action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate
32 licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the
33 duration of the APRN's participation in an alternative program.
34 ARTICLE 6—COORDIANTED LICENSURE INFORMATION
35 SYSTEM AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
36 (a) All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure
37 information system of all APRNs, licensed registered nurses, licensed
38 practical nurses and vocational nurses. This system shall include
39 information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each APRN, as
40 submitted by party states, to assist in the coordinated administration of
41 APRN licensure and enforcement efforts.
42 (b) The commission, in consultation with the administrator of the
43 coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and

HB 2266 9
1 proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of
2 information under this compact.
3 (c) All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated
4 licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant
5 investigative information, denials of applications, with the reasons for such
6 denials, and APRN participation in alternative programs known to the
7 licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed
8 nonpublic or confidential under state law.
9 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state
10 licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure
11 information system shall designate information that shall not be shared
12 with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without
13 the express permission of the contributing state.
14 (e) Any personally identifiable information obtained from the
15 coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board
16 shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or
17 individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state
18 contributing the information.
19 (f) Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure
20 information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the
21 laws of the party state contributing the information shall be removed from
22 the coordinated licensure information system.
23 (g) The compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a

7 orally or in writing. All hearings shalll be recorded and a copy will be
8 made available upon request.
9 (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
10 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
11 commission at hearings required by this section.
12 (h) If no one appears at the public hearing, the commission may
13 proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule.
14 (i) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business
15 on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission
16 shall consider all written and oral comments received.
17 (j) The commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take
18 final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of
19 the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
20 (k) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission
21 may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice,
22 opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking
23 procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall be
24 retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event
25 later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of
26 this provision, an emergency rule is one that shall be adopted immediately
27 in order to:
28 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
29 (2) prevent a loss of commission or party state funds; or
30 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that
31 is established by federal law or rule.
32 (l) The commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule
33 or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in
34 format, errors in consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
35 revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision
36 shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after
37 posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision
38 results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing,
39 and delivered to the commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If
40 no challenge is made, the revision shalll take effect without further action.
41 If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
42 approval of the commission.
43 ARTICLE 9—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND

HB 2266 16
1 ENFORCEMENT
2 (a) Oversight.
3 (1) Each party state shall enforce this compact and take all actions
4 necessary and appropriate to effectuate this compact's purposes and intent.
5 (2) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
6 any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of
7 the commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding
8 for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the commission
9 shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact
10 or promulgated rules.
11 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
12 (1) If the commission determines that a party state has defaulted in
13 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or
14 the promulgated rules, the commission shall:
15 (A) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party
16 states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default
17 or any other action to be taken by the commission; and
18 (B) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance
19 regarding the default.
20 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's
21 membership in this compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote
22 of a majority of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits
23 conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
24 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
25 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
26 (3) Termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only
27 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
28 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
29 governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the
30 defaulting state's licensing board, the defaulting state's licensing board,
31 and each of the party states.
32 (4) A state whose membership in this compact has been terminated is
33 responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through
34 the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond
35 the effective date of termination.
36 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
37 found to be in default or whose membership in this compact has been
38 terminated, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
39 defaulting state.
40 (6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by
41 petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
42 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
43 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including

HB 2266 17
1 reasonable attorney fees.
2 (c) Dispute resolution.
3 (1) Upon request by a party state, the commission shall attempt to
4 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among party states and
5 between party and non-party states.
6 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
7 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
8 (3) In the event the commission cannot resolve disputes among party
9 states arising under this compact:
10 (A) The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration
11 panel, which shall be comprised of individuals appointed by the compact
12 administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual
13 mutually agreed upon by the compact administrators of all the party states
14 involved in the dispute.
15 (B) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and
16 binding.
17 (d) Enforcement.
18 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
19 enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
20 (2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the
21 United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
22 district where the commission has its principal offices against a party state
23 that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact
24 and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
25 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
26 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
27 including reasonable attorney fees.
28 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
29 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
30 under federal or state law.
31 ARTICLE 10—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
32 AMENDMENT
33 (a) This compact shall come into limited effect at such time as this
34 compact has been enacted into law in seven party states for the sole
35 purpose of establishing and convening the commission to adopt rules
36 relating to its operation.
37 (b) Any state that joins this compact subsequent to the commission's
38 initial adoption of the APRN uniform licensure requirements shall be
39 subject to all rules that have been previously adopted by the commission.
40 (c) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
41 statute repealing the same. A party state's withdrawal shall not take effect
42 until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.
43 (d) A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the

HB 2266 18
1 continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing
2 board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring
3 prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.
4 (e) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
5 or prevent any APRN licensure agreement or other cooperative
6 arrangement between a party state and a non-party state that does not
7 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
8 (f) This compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment
9 to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any party state
10 until it is enacted into the laws of all party states.
11 (g) Representatives of non-party states to this compact shall be
12 invited to participate in the activities of the commission, on a nonvoting
13 basis, prior to the adoption of this compact by all states.
14 ARTICLE 11—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
15 This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the
16 purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if
17 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be
18 contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or if
19 the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
20 circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact
21 and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
22 circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held to
23 be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this compact shall remain
24 in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and
25 effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.
26 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
27 publication in the statute book.
