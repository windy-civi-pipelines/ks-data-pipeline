8 (b) On and after January 1, 2026, every employer shall be required to
9 provide to its employees 20 hours of paid prenatal personal leave during
10 the calendar year. Paid prenatal personal leave shall mean leave taken for
11 the healthcare services received by an employee during their pregnancy or

17 the employee's regular rate of pay, or the applicable minimum wage,
18 whichever is greater, for the use of paid prenatal personal leave. Nothing
19 in this section shall be construed to require an employer to pay an
20 employee for unused paid prenatal leave upon such employee's
21 termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from employment.
22 (c) An employer may not require the disclosure of confidential
23 information relating to the health condition of such employee as a
24 condition of providing paid prenatal personal leave pursuant to this
25 section.
26 (d) Upon return to work following any paid prenatal leave taken
27 pursuant to this section, an employee shall be restored by their employer to
28 the position of employment held by such employee prior to any paid
29 prenatal leave taken pursuant to this section with the same pay and other
30 terms and conditions of employment.
31 (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or prevent an
32 employer from providing an amount of paid prenatal personal leave in
33 excess of the requirements set forth in this section or from adopting a paid
34 leave policy that provides additional benefits to employees.
35 (f) (1) An employer or their agent, an officer or agent of any
36 corporation, partnership or limited liability company or any other person

SB 153 2
1 shall not discharge, threaten, penalize or in any other manner discriminate

4 requesting paid prenatal leave and using paid prenatal leave.
5 (2) Any employee or former employee aggrieved by a violation of
6 this section, the department of labor or the attorney general may bring a
7 civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer
8 violating this act. Upon prevailing in an action brought pursuant to this
9 section, employees and former employees shall be entitled to such legal or
10 equitable relief as may be appropriate to remedy the violation, including,
11 but not limited to, reinstatement to employment, back pay and injunctive
12 relief.
13 (g) The department of labor shall conduct a public awareness
14 outreach campaign that includes making information available on its
15 website and informing employers and employees of the provisions of this
16 section.
