34 county, setting forth the tax liability and the amount of such tax remitted
35 by each retailer during the preceding month and identifying each business
36 location maintained by the retailer and such retailer's sales or use tax
37 registration or account number. Such report shall be made available to the
38 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of such city or county within a
39 reasonable time after it has been requested from the director of taxation.
40 The director of taxation shall be allowed to assess a reasonable fee for the
41 issuance of such report. Information received by any city or county
42 pursuant to this section shall be confidential, and it shall be unlawful for
43 any officer or employee of such city or county to divulge any such
HB 2390 19
1 information in any manner. Any violation of this paragraph by a city or
2 county officer or employee is a class A misdemeanor, and such officer or
3 employee shall be dismissed from office. Reports of violations of this
4 paragraph shall be investigated by the attorney general. The district
5 attorney or county attorney and the attorney general shall have authority to
6 prosecute violations of this paragraph.

21 (c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
22 subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total tangible
23 property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax revenue
24 derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible property
25 located within each such city or county. The ad valorem property tax levy
26 of any county or city district entity or subdivision shall be included within
27 this term if the levy of any such district entity or subdivision is applicable
28 to all tangible property located within each such city or county.
29 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
30 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for the
31 purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be included
32 within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such city regardless
33 of its applicability to all tangible property located within each such city. If
34 the tax is levied by a district which extends across city boundaries, for
35 purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy shall be apportioned
36 among each city in which such district extends in the proportion that such
37 tax levied within each city bears to the total tax levied by the district.

39 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I), (6),

41 (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and, (38) and
42 (39), and amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by
43 the county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue
HB 2390 21
1 received from the tax was pledged.
2 (2) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and
3 amendments thereto, all revenues received from a countywide retailers'
4 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
5 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
6 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax
7 was pledged.
8 (3) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
9 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, shall

12 unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax authorized
13 by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes the
14 apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
15 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall be
16 paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general fund
17 of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or more
18 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
19 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
20 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
21 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
22 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
23 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
24 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
25 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
26 each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county from the
27 state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.

29 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such information
30 deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion and remit
31 revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
32 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment of
33 countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues received
34 pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or collected
35 under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such revenue
36 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall be
37 deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
38 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.
39 74-8927, and amendments thereto.
40 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-187, 12-189 and 12-192 are hereby
41 repealed.
42 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its

28 Any county or city levying a retailers' sales tax is hereby prohibited
29 from administering or collecting such tax locally, but shall utilize the
30 services of the state department of revenue to administer, enforce and
31 collect such tax. Except as otherwise specifically provided in K.S.A. 12-
32 189a, and amendments thereto, such tax shall be identical in its
33 application, and exemptions therefrom, to the Kansas retailers' sales tax act
34 and all laws and administrative rules and regulations of the state
35 department of revenue relating to the Kansas retailers' sales tax shall apply
36 to such local sales tax insofar as such laws and rules and regulations may
37 be made applicable. The state director of taxation is hereby authorized to
38 administer, enforce and collect such local sales taxes and to adopt such
39 rules and regulations as may be necessary for the efficient and effective
40 administration and enforcement thereof.
41 Upon receipt of a certified copy of an ordinance or resolution
42 authorizing the levy of a local retailers' sales tax, the director of taxation
43 shall cause such taxes to be collected within or without the boundaries of

HB 2390 18
1 such taxing subdivision at the same time and in the same manner provided
2 for the collection of the state retailers' sales tax. Such copy shall be
3 submitted to the director of taxation within 30 days after adoption of any
4 such ordinance or resolution. The director of taxation shall confirm that all
5 provisions of law applicable to the authorization of local sales tax have
6 been followed prior to causing the collection. If the director of taxation
7 discovers that a city or county did not comply with any provision of law
8 applicable to the authorization of a local sales tax after collection has
9 commenced, the director shall immediately notify the city or county and
10 cease collection of such sales tax until such noncompliance is remedied.
11 All moneys collected by the director of taxation under the provisions of
12 this section shall be credited to a county and city retailers' sales tax fund
13 which fund is hereby established in the state treasury, except that all
14 moneys collected by the director of taxation pursuant to the authority
15 granted in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(22), and amendments thereto, shall be
16 credited to the Wilson county capital improvements fund. Any refund due
17 on any county or city retailers' sales tax collected pursuant to this act shall
18 be paid out of the sales tax refund fund and reimbursed by the director of
19 taxation from collections of local retailers' sales tax revenue. Except for
20 local retailers' sales tax revenue required to be deposited in the
21 redevelopment bond fund established under K.S.A. 74-8927, and
22 amendments thereto, all local retailers' sales tax revenue collected within
23 any county or city pursuant to this act shall be apportioned and remitted at
24 least quarterly by the state treasurer, on instruction from the director of
25 taxation, to the treasurer of such county or city.
26 Revenue that is received from the imposition of a local retailers' sales
27 tax that exceeds the amount of revenue required to pay the costs of a
28 special project for which such revenue was pledged shall be credited to the
29 city or county general fund, as the case requires.
30 The director of taxation shall provide, upon request by a city or county
31 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of any city or county levying a local
32 retailers' sales tax, monthly reports identifying each retailer doing business
33 in such city or county or making taxable sales sourced to such city or
34 county, setting forth the tax liability and the amount of such tax remitted
35 by each retailer during the preceding month and identifying each business
36 location maintained by the retailer and such retailer's sales or use tax
37 registration or account number. Such report shall be made available to the
38 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of such city or county within a
39 reasonable time after it has been requested from the director of taxation.
40 The director of taxation shall be allowed to assess a reasonable fee for the
41 issuance of such report. Information received by any city or county
42 pursuant to this section shall be confidential, and it shall be unlawful for
43 any officer or employee of such city or county to divulge any such

HB 2390 19
1 information in any manner. Any violation of this paragraph by a city or
2 county officer or employee is a class A misdemeanor, and such officer or
3 employee shall be dismissed from office. Reports of violations of this
4 paragraph shall be investigated by the attorney general. The district
5 attorney or county attorney and the attorney general shall have authority to
6 prosecute violations of this paragraph.
7 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-192 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 12-192. (a) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (b), (d) or
9 (h), all revenue received by the director of taxation from a countywide
10 retailers' sales tax shall be apportioned among the county and each city
11 located in such county in the following manner:
12 (1) 1/ of all revenue received by the director of taxation shall be
2
13 apportioned among the county and each city located in such county in the
14 proportion that the total tangible property tax levies made in such county
15 in the preceding year for all funds of each such governmental unit bear to
16 the total of all such levies made in the preceding year; and
17 (2) 1/ of all revenue received by the director of taxation from such
2
18 countywide retailers' sales tax shall be apportioned among the county and
19 each city located in such county, first to the county that portion of the
20 revenue equal to the proportion that the population of the county residing
21 in the unincorporated area of the county bears to the total population of the
22 county, and second to the cities in the proportion that the population of
23 each city bears to the total population of the county, except that no persons
24 residing within the Fort Riley military reservation shall be included in the
25 determination of the population of any city located within Riley county.
26 All revenue apportioned to a county shall be paid to its county treasurer
27 and shall be credited to the general fund of the county.
28 (b) (1) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection
29 (a), all revenue received by the director of taxation from a countywide
30 retailers' sales tax imposed within Johnson county at the rate of 0.75%, 1%
31 or 1.25% after July 1, 2007, shall be apportioned among the county and
32 each city located in such county in the following manner:
33 (A) The revenue received from the first 0.5% rate of tax shall be
34 apportioned in the manner prescribed by subsection (a); and
35 (B) the revenue received from the rate of tax exceeding 0.5% shall be
36 apportioned as follows:
37 (i) 1/ shall be apportioned among the county and each city located in
4
38 such county in the proportion that the total tangible property tax levies
39 made in such county in the preceding year for all funds of each such
40 governmental unit bear to the total of all such levies made in the preceding
41 year;
42 (ii) 1/ shall be apportioned among the county and each city located in
4
43 such county, first to the county that portion of the revenue equal to the

HB 2390 20
1 proportion that the population of the county residing in the unincorporated
2 area of the county bears to the total population of the county, and second to
3 the cities in the proportion that the population of each city bears to the
4 total population of the county; and
5 (iii) 1/ shall be retained by the county for its sole use and benefit.
2
6 (2) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),
7 all money received by the director of taxation from a countywide sales tax
8 imposed within Montgomery county pursuant to the election held on
9 November 8, 1994, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county
10 and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from
11 the tax was pledged. All revenue apportioned and paid from the imposition
12 of such tax to the treasurer of any city prior to the effective date of this act
13 shall be remitted to the county treasurer and expended only for the purpose
14 for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
15 (3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),
16 on and after the effective date of this act, all moneys received by the
17 director of taxation from a countywide retailers' sales tax imposed within
18 Phillips county pursuant to the election held on September 20, 2005, shall
19 be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended only for
20 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
21 (c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
22 subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total tangible
23 property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax revenue
24 derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible property
25 located within each such city or county. The ad valorem property tax levy
26 of any county or city district entity or subdivision shall be included within
27 this term if the levy of any such district entity or subdivision is applicable
28 to all tangible property located within each such city or county.
29 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
30 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for the
31 purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be included
32 within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such city regardless
33 of its applicability to all tangible property located within each such city. If
34 the tax is levied by a district which extends across city boundaries, for
35 purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy shall be apportioned
36 among each city in which such district extends in the proportion that such
37 tax levied within each city bears to the total tax levied by the district.
38 (d) (1) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
39 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I), (6),
40 (7), (8), (9), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (23), (25),
41 (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and, (38) and
42 (39), and amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by
43 the county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue

HB 2390 21
1 received from the tax was pledged.
2 (2) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and
3 amendments thereto, all revenues received from a countywide retailers'
4 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
5 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
6 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax
7 was pledged.
8 (3) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
9 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, shall
10 be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended only for
11 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged
12 unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax authorized
13 by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes the
14 apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
15 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall be
16 paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general fund
17 of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or more
18 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
19 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
20 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
21 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
22 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
23 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
24 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
25 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
26 each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county from the
27 state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.
28 (g) Prior to December 31 of each year, the clerk of every county
29 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such information
30 deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion and remit
31 revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
32 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment of
33 countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues received
34 pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or collected
35 under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such revenue
36 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall be
37 deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
38 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.
39 74-8927, and amendments thereto.
40 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-187, 12-189 and 12-192 are hereby
41 repealed.
42 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
43 publication in the statute book.
