15 establish a process for a PSAP or governing body that contracts with
16 another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP services,
17 to seek pre-approval of an expenditure. The state 911 board shall respond
18 in writing to any pre-approval request within 30 days and inform the PSAP
19 stating whether the requested expenditure is approved or disapproved. If
20 the expenditure is disapproved, the written notification shall state the
21 reason for the disapproval and such PSAP or governing body may, within
22 15 days after service of the notification, make a written request to the state
23 911 board to appeal the board's decision and for a hearing to be conducted
24 in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure
25 act.
26 (c) The state 911 board shall annually review expenditures of 911
27 moneys reported on the annual report for each PSAP or governing body

30 expenditures. If the committee determines that a reported expenditure was
31 not authorized by this act, the committee shall request that the expenditure
32 be refunded by the PSAP or governing body to the PSAP's or governing
33 body's 911 account. If a PSAP or governing body does not concur with the
34 finding of the committee, the PSAP or governing body may request a
35 review of the decision of the committee before the state 911 board. If the
36 state 911 board, based upon information obtained from an audit,
37 determines that any PSAP or governing body has used any 911 fees for
38 any purpose other than those authorized in this act, the governing body for
39 such PSAP or governing body that contracts with another governing body
40 of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP services shall repay all such
41 moneys used for any unauthorized purposes to the 911 fee fund of such
42 PSAP or governing body. Upon a finding that the expenditure was made
43 intentionally for a purpose clearly established as an unauthorized

HB 2110 11
1 expenditure, the state 911 board may require such PSAP or governing
2 body to pay the lesser of $500 or 10%, of such misused moneys, to the
3 LCPA state 911 board. Upon receipt of any moneys paid pursuant to this
4 subsection, the LCPA state 911 board shall remit such moneys to the state
5 treasurer in accordance with K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto.
6 Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the
7 entire amount in the state treasury and credit such amount to the state 911
8 grant fund. No such repayment of 911 fees shall be imposed pursuant to
9 this section except upon the written order of the state 911 board. Such
10 order shall state the unauthorized purposes for which the funds were used,
11 the amount of funds to be repaid and the right of such PSAP or governing
12 body to appeal to a hearing before the Kansas office of administrative
13 hearings. Any such PSAP or governing body may, within 15 days after
14 service of the order, make a written request to the state 911 board for a
15 hearing thereon. Hearings under this subsection shall be conducted in
16 accordance with the provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act.
