services. The amount of money distributed to the PSAPs in each
county, or to any governing body that contracts with another governing
body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP services, shall be based
upon the amount of 911 fees collected from service users located in that

established for the preceding calendar year multiplied by the average
percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban
consumers in the midwest region as published by the bureau of labor
statistics of the United States department of labor for the preceding
calendar year. Prior to increasing the minimum county distribution
amount, the state 911 board shall evaluate:
(A) Whether an increase is needed based on the expenditures of
the counties that are subject to such minimum distribution; and
(B) the impact of any such proposed increase to the long-term
financial stability of all other distributions to PSAPs and counties made
pursuant to this section.
(4) If there is a single PSAP providing services for a county, such
PSAP shall receive the governing body's distribution, if any. If there is
more than one PSAP in a county then distributions to each PSAP shall
be proportionately divided between the PSAPs in the county.
(5)(3) After each distribution that is made pursuant to this section,
the state 911 board or LCPA shall certify to the director of accounts and

moneys distributed to any such governing body pursuant to K.S.A. 12-
5374, and amendments thereto, shall only be used as authorized by this

Section 3:
section. If a governing body serves as the provider of PSAP services for
another governing body, both governing bodies shall enter into a
contract or memorandum of agreement that addresses contingency
HOUSE BILL No. 2110—page 7
plans and overflow arrangements. Any such contract or memorandum
of agreement shall be reviewed by the state 911 board with respect to
the provisions that relate to contingency plans and overflow
arrangements or that may conflict with the function of the statewide
911 system. If the state 911 board determines that any such provisions
are not acceptable, the state 911 board and the governing bodies shall
collaborate and work to resolve such concerns prior to the effective
date of such contract or memorandum of agreement. Any governing
body contracting with another governing body of a PSAP for the
provision of 911 PSAP services shall establish in the contract or
memorandum of agreement an agreed upon percentage of the
governing body's distribution amount for the LCPA state 911 board to
distribute to the governing body of the PSAP that is providing the 911
services.
(b) The state 911 board shall, pursuant to rules and regulations,
establish a process for a PSAP or governing body that contracts with
another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP
services, to seek pre-approval of an expenditure. The state 911 board
shall respond in writing to any pre-approval request within 30 days and
inform the PSAP stating whether the requested expenditure is approved
or disapproved. If the expenditure is disapproved, the written
notification shall state the reason for the disapproval and such PSAP or
governing body may, within 15 days after service of the notification,
make a written request to the state 911 board to appeal the board's
decision and for a hearing to be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act.
(c) The state 911 board shall annually review expenditures of 911
moneys reported on the annual report for each PSAP or governing body
that contracts with another governing body of a PSAP for the provision
of 911 PSAP services and shall appoint a committee to review such
expenditures. If the committee determines that a reported expenditure
was not authorized by this act, the committee shall request that the
expenditure be refunded by the PSAP or governing body to the PSAP's
or governing body's 911 account. If a PSAP or governing body does not
concur with the finding of the committee, the PSAP or governing body
may request a review of the decision of the committee before the state
911 board. If the state 911 board, based upon information obtained
from an audit, determines that any PSAP or governing body has used
any 911 fees for any purpose other than those authorized in this act, the
governing body for such PSAP or governing body that contracts with
another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP
services shall repay all such moneys used for any unauthorized
purposes to the 911 fee fund of such PSAP or governing body. Upon a
finding that the expenditure was made intentionally for a purpose
clearly established as an unauthorized expenditure, the state 911 board
may require such PSAP or governing body to pay the lesser of $500 or
10%, of such misused moneys, to the LCPA state 911 board. Upon
receipt of any moneys paid pursuant to this subsection, the LCPA state
911 board shall remit such moneys to the state treasurer in accordance
with K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each
such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in
the state treasury and credit such amount to the state 911 grant fund. No
such repayment of 911 fees shall be imposed pursuant to this section
except upon the written order of the state 911 board. Such order shall
state the unauthorized purposes for which the funds were used, the
amount of funds to be repaid and the right of such PSAP or governing
body to appeal to a hearing before the Kansas office of administrative
hearings. Any such PSAP or governing body may, within 15 days after
service of the order, make a written request to the state 911 board for a
hearing thereon. Hearings under this subsection shall be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure
act.

(b) or (c) is subject to review in accordance with the Kansas judicial
HOUSE BILL No. 2110—page 8

provider.
(e) Each provider shall remit the amount of all 911 fees collected
in each calendar month to the LCPA state 911 board not more than 15
days after the close of such calendar month. Upon each such
remittance, the provider shall file a return for the preceding month with
the LCPA board. Such remittance and return shall be provided in such
form and manner as required by the board. The provider required to file
the return shall deliver the return together with a remittance of the

records of the amount of any such fees collected in accordance with
this act for a period of three years from the time the fees are collected.
(f) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to apply to
the prepaid wireless 911 fee.
Sec. 7. On and after January 1, 2026, K.S.A. 12-5372, as amended
by section 22 of chapter 53 of the 2024 Session Laws of Kansas, is
hereby amended to read as follows: 12-5372. (a) Prepaid wireless 911

The department shall establish registration and payment procedures for

(b) To minimize additional costs to the department, the department

audits. The department is authorized to provide the board and LCPA
with information obtained in such audits if such information indicates
that a seller may not be complying with the provisions of this section

HOUSE BILL No. 2110—page 5
and K.S.A. 12-5371, and amendments thereto. The board or LCPA may
request the department to initiate collection or audit procedures on
individual sellers if collection efforts by the board or LCPA are
unsuccessful.
(c) The department shall establish procedures by which a seller
may document that a sale is not a retail sale, which procedures shall
substantially coincide with procedures for documenting sale for resale
transactions for article 36 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes
Annotated, and amendments thereto.
(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the department shall
remit all moneys collected from the prepaid wireless 911 fees to the
state treasurer in accordance with K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments

(2) If the department remits $3,000,000 to the state treasurer
pursuant to paragraph (1) in any given year, then all remaining moneys
collected from the prepaid wireless 911 fee shall be remitted to the state

Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit
the entire amount in the state treasury and credit such amount to the
state 911 fund established pursuant to section 7, and amendments
thereto. Such moneys shall be distributed to governing bodies and
PSAPs in an amount proportional to each county's population as a
percentage share of the population of the state. For each PSAP within a
county, such moneys shall be distributed to each PSAP in an amount
proportional to the PSAP's population as a percentage share of the
population of the county. If there is no PSAP within a county, then such
moneys shall be distributed to the governing body that contracts with
another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP
services. Moneys distributed pursuant to this paragraph shall only be
used for the uses authorized in K.S.A. 12-5375, and amendments
thereto.
Sec. 8. On and after January 1, 2026, K.S.A. 12-5374, as amended
by section 25 of chapter 53 of the 2024 Session Laws of Kansas, is
hereby amended to read as follows: 12-5374. (a) (1) Except for the
amounts withheld by the LCPA pursuant to K.S.A. 12-5368, and
amendments thereto credited to the state 911 operations fund and state
911 grant fund pursuant to K.S.A. 12-5372, and amendments thereto,
and section 1, and amendments thereto, and any amounts withheld
from distribution pursuant to section 4 K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-5386, and
amendments thereto, not later than 30 days after the receipt of 911 fees
from providers pursuant to K.S.A. 12-5370, and amendments thereto,
and prepaid wireless 911 fees from the department pursuant to K.S.A.
12-5372, and amendments thereto, the state 911 board shall distribute
such moneys to the PSAPs or to governing bodies that contract with
another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP
services. The amount of money distributed to the PSAPs in each
county, or to any governing body that contracts with another governing
body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP services, shall be based
upon the amount of 911 fees collected from service users located in that
county, based on place of primary use information provided by the
providers, by using the following distribution method:
Population of county Percentage of collected
911 fees to distribute
Over 80,000................................................................................................................... 85%
65,000 to 79,999............................................................................................................ 88%
55,000 to 64,999............................................................................................................ 91%
45,000 to 54,999............................................................................................................ 94%
35,000 to 44,999............................................................................................................ 97%
Less than 35,000.......................................................................................................... 100%
(2) If the calculated amount for distribution within a county is less
than $70,000, the $70,000 shall be distributed for services within that
county.

HOUSE BILL No. 2110—page 6
(3) The state 911 board may increase the minimum county
distribution amount not more than once per calendar year by an amount
that shall not exceed the minimum county distribution amount
established for the preceding calendar year multiplied by the average
percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban
consumers in the midwest region as published by the bureau of labor
statistics of the United States department of labor for the preceding
calendar year. Prior to increasing the minimum county distribution
amount, the state 911 board shall evaluate:
(A) Whether an increase is needed based on the expenditures of
the counties that are subject to such minimum distribution; and
(B) the impact of any such proposed increase to the long-term
financial stability of all other distributions to PSAPs and counties made
pursuant to this section.
(4) If there is a single PSAP providing services for a county, such
PSAP shall receive the governing body's distribution, if any. If there is
more than one PSAP in a county then distributions to each PSAP shall
be proportionately divided between the PSAPs in the county.
(5)(3) After each distribution that is made pursuant to this section,
the state 911 board or LCPA shall certify to the director of accounts and
reports the total amount of unencumbered moneys remaining in the
state 911 fund and the amount of moneys that could not be attributed to
a specific PSAP or governing body. Upon receipt of such certification,
the director of accounts and reports shall transfer such certified amount
from the state 911 fund to the state 911 operations fund.
(b). The state 911 board and the LCPA shall keep accurate
accounts of all receipts and disbursements of moneys from the 911 fees.
(c) Records provided by any provider to the LCPA or to the state
911 board pursuant to this act shall be treated as proprietary records and
shall be withheld from the public upon request of the provider
submitting such records.
Sec. 9. On and after January 1, 2026, K.S.A. 12-5375, as amended
by section 28 of chapter 53 of the 2024 Session Laws of Kansas, is
hereby amended to read as follows: 12-5375. (a) (1) Moneys
distributed to governing bodies and PSAPs pursuant to K.S.A. 12-5374,
and amendments thereto, and any interest earned on revenue derived
from such moneys, shall be used only for necessary and reasonable
costs incurred or to be incurred by governing bodies and PSAPs for:
(A) Implementation of 911 services;
(B) purchase of 911 equipment and upgrades;
(C) maintenance and license fees for 911 equipment;
(D) training of personnel, not to include salaries;
(E) monthly recurring charges billed by service suppliers;
(F) installation, service establishment and nonrecurring start-up
charges billed by the service supplier;
(G) charges for capital improvements and equipment or other
physical enhancements to the 911 system;
(H) maintenance and updates that are necessary to maintain
accurate GIS data;
(I) emergency repair or replacement of a radio tower; or
(J) the original acquisition and installation of road signs designed
to aid in the delivery of emergency service.
(2) Such costs shall not include expenditures to lease, construct,
expand, acquire, remodel, renovate, repair, furnish or make
improvements to buildings or similar facilities. Such costs shall also not
include expenditures to purchase, procure, maintain or upgrade
subscriber radio equipment.
(3) A governing body may contract with another governing body
of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP services provided that the
moneys distributed to any such governing body pursuant to K.S.A. 12-
5374, and amendments thereto, shall only be used as authorized by this
section. If a governing body serves as the provider of PSAP services for
another governing body, both governing bodies shall enter into a
contract or memorandum of agreement that addresses contingency

HOUSE BILL No. 2110—page 7
plans and overflow arrangements. Any such contract or memorandum
of agreement shall be reviewed by the state 911 board with respect to
the provisions that relate to contingency plans and overflow
arrangements or that may conflict with the function of the statewide
911 system. If the state 911 board determines that any such provisions
are not acceptable, the state 911 board and the governing bodies shall
collaborate and work to resolve such concerns prior to the effective
date of such contract or memorandum of agreement. Any governing
body contracting with another governing body of a PSAP for the
provision of 911 PSAP services shall establish in the contract or
memorandum of agreement an agreed upon percentage of the
governing body's distribution amount for the LCPA state 911 board to
distribute to the governing body of the PSAP that is providing the 911
services.
(b) The state 911 board shall, pursuant to rules and regulations,
establish a process for a PSAP or governing body that contracts with
another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP
services, to seek pre-approval of an expenditure. The state 911 board
shall respond in writing to any pre-approval request within 30 days and
inform the PSAP stating whether the requested expenditure is approved
or disapproved. If the expenditure is disapproved, the written
notification shall state the reason for the disapproval and such PSAP or
governing body may, within 15 days after service of the notification,
make a written request to the state 911 board to appeal the board's
decision and for a hearing to be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act.
(c) The state 911 board shall annually review expenditures of 911
moneys reported on the annual report for each PSAP or governing body
that contracts with another governing body of a PSAP for the provision
of 911 PSAP services and shall appoint a committee to review such
expenditures. If the committee determines that a reported expenditure
was not authorized by this act, the committee shall request that the
expenditure be refunded by the PSAP or governing body to the PSAP's
or governing body's 911 account. If a PSAP or governing body does not
concur with the finding of the committee, the PSAP or governing body
may request a review of the decision of the committee before the state
911 board. If the state 911 board, based upon information obtained
from an audit, determines that any PSAP or governing body has used
any 911 fees for any purpose other than those authorized in this act, the
governing body for such PSAP or governing body that contracts with
another governing body of a PSAP for the provision of 911 PSAP
services shall repay all such moneys used for any unauthorized
purposes to the 911 fee fund of such PSAP or governing body. Upon a
finding that the expenditure was made intentionally for a purpose
clearly established as an unauthorized expenditure, the state 911 board
may require such PSAP or governing body to pay the lesser of $500 or
10%, of such misused moneys, to the LCPA state 911 board. Upon
receipt of any moneys paid pursuant to this subsection, the LCPA state
911 board shall remit such moneys to the state treasurer in accordance
with K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each
such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in
the state treasury and credit such amount to the state 911 grant fund. No
such repayment of 911 fees shall be imposed pursuant to this section
except upon the written order of the state 911 board. Such order shall
state the unauthorized purposes for which the funds were used, the
amount of funds to be repaid and the right of such PSAP or governing
body to appeal to a hearing before the Kansas office of administrative
hearings. Any such PSAP or governing body may, within 15 days after
service of the order, make a written request to the state 911 board for a
hearing thereon. Hearings under this subsection shall be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure
act.
(d) Any final action of the state 911 board pursuant to subsection
(b) or (c) is subject to review in accordance with the Kansas judicial

HOUSE BILL No. 2110—page 8
