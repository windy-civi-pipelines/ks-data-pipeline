32 (d) The department may authorize another category of provider other
33 than a mental health intervention team provider to serve as a partnering

17 all districts. The department shall be responsible for the allocation and
18 distribution of grants in accordance with appropriation acts. The
19 department may make grant payments in installments and may provide for
20 payments in advance or by way of reimbursement and may make any
21 necessary adjustments for any overpayment to a school district. The

18 (A) If a school district and mental health intervention team provider
19 are approved to establish or maintain a mental health intervention team
20 program, the school district shall enter into a memorandum of

22 (B) If the school district chooses to partner with more than one
23 mental health intervention team provider, the school district shall enter into

27 understanding, including contractual provisions that are required to be
28 included in each memorandum of understanding and that are optional and
29 subject to agreement between the school district and the mental health
30 intervention team provider. Each memorandum of understanding shall be
31 submitted to the department for final approval.
32 (d) The department may authorize another category of provider other
33 than a mental health intervention team provider to serve as a partnering
34 provider under the mental health intervention team program pursuant to

37 intervention team provider under this subsection. If the department

3 provider pass-through grant.
4 (A) Except as provided in subsection (f), the amount of a school

6 determined in each school year by calculating the total amount of the
7 salary and fringe benefits paid by the school district to each school liaison.
8 (B) The amount of a school district's mental health intervention team
9 provider pass-through grant shall be an amount equal to 35% of the

13 intervention team provider that partners with the school district.
14 (2) If the amount of appropriations are insufficient to pay the full
15 amount of all grants that school districts are entitled to receive for the
16 school year, the department shall prorate the amount appropriated among
17 all districts. The department shall be responsible for the allocation and
18 distribution of grants in accordance with appropriation acts. The
19 department may make grant payments in installments and may provide for
20 payments in advance or by way of reimbursement and may make any
21 necessary adjustments for any overpayment to a school district. The
22 department shall not award any grant to a school district unless such
23 district has entered into a memorandum of understanding with a partnering
24 mental health intervention team provider in accordance with subsection
25 (c).
