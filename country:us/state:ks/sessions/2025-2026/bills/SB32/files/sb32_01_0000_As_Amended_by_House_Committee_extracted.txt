Session of 2025
By Committee on Assessment and Taxation
1-16
1 AN ACT concerning insurance; relating to taxation; reducing insurance
2 company premium tax rates; discontinuing remittance and crediting of
3 a portion of the premium tax to the insurance department service
4 regulation fund; amending K.S.A. 40-112 and 40-252 and repealing the
5 existing sections.
6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 40-112 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
9 112. (a) For the purpose of maintaining the insurance department and the
10 payment of expenses incident thereto, there is hereby established the
11 insurance department service regulation fund in the state treasury, which
12 shall be administered by the commissioner of insurance. All expenditures
13 from the insurance department service regulation fund shall be made in
14 accordance with appropriation acts upon warrants of the director of
15 accounts and reports issued pursuant to vouchers approved by the
16 commissioner of insurance or by a person or persons designated by the
17 commissioner.
18 (b) On and after the effective date of this act January 1, 2026, all fees
19 received by the commissioner of insurance pursuant to any statute and 1%
20 of taxes received pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto,
21 shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of
22 K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such
23 remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state
24 treasury to the credit of the insurance department service regulation fund.
25 (c) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the commissioner of
26 insurance shall make an annual assessment on each group of affiliated
27 insurers whose certificates of authority to do business in this state are in
28 good standing at the time of the assessment. The total amount of all such
29 assessments for a fiscal year shall be equal to the amount sufficient
30 whichthat, when combined with the total amount to be credited to the
31 insurance department service regulation fund pursuant to subsection (b) is
32 equal to the amount approved by the legislature to fund the insurance
33 company regulation program. With respect to each group of affiliated
34 insurers, such assessment shall be in proportion to the amount of total
35 assets of the group of affiliated insurers as reported to the commissioner of
36 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto, for the
SB 32—Am. by HC 2
1 immediately preceding calendar year, shall not be less than $500 and shall
2 not be more than the amount equal to .0000015 of the amount of total
3 assets of the group of affiliated insurers or $25,000, whichever is less. The
4 total assessment for any fiscal year shall not increase by any amount
5 greater than 15% of the total budget approved by the legislature to fund the
6 insurance company regulation program for the fiscal year immediately
7 preceding the fiscal year for which the assessment is made. In the event
8 the total amount of the assessment would be less than the aggregate
9 amount resulting by assessing the $500 minimum on each insurer, the
10 commissioner may establish a lower minimum to be assessed equally on
11 each insurer.
12 (d) If, by the laws of any state other than Kansas or by the retaliatory
13 laws of any state other than Kansas, any insurer domiciled in Kansas shall
14 be required to pay any fee or tax in such other state of licensure, and the
15 fee or tax is due and payable either because the insurance department
16 service regulation fee imposed by this section on insurers licensed in
17 Kansas and organized or domiciled in such other state is greater than the
18 comparable fee or tax assessed in such other state, or such other state has
19 no comparable fee or tax but requires payment on a retaliatory basis, then
20 to the extent such fee or tax amounts are legally due and are paid in such
21 other state, any insurer domiciled in Kansas may claim a dollar-for-dollar
22 credit for such fees paid against insurer's annual premium taxes due the
23 state of Kansas under K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or privilege
24 fee due the state of Kansas under K.S.A. 40-3213, and amendments
25 thereto, but such credit shall only be calculated on the amount which that
26 would not have been required to be paid in such other state of licensure in
27 the absence of the existence of the insurance department service regulation
28 fee imposed by this section, and in no event shall the credit permitted by
29 this section exceed 90% of the insurer's annual premium tax or privilege
30 fee due the state of Kansas. The insurance commissioner shall prescribe
31 the forms for reporting such credits.
32 (e) Assessments payable under this section shall be past due if not
33 paid to the insurance department within 45 days of the billing date of such
34 assessment. A penalty equal to 10% of the amount assessed shall be
35 imposed upon any past due payment and the total amount of the
36 assessment and penalty shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or
37 any portion thereof.
38 (f) When there exists in the insurance department service regulation
39 fund a deficiency which that would render such fund temporarily
40 insufficient during any fiscal year to meet the insurance department's
41 funding requirements, the commissioner of insurance shall certify the
42 amount of the insufficiency. Upon receipt of any such certification, the
43 director of accounts and reports shall transfer an amount of moneys equal
SB 32—Am. by HC 3
1 to the amount so certified from the state general fund to the insurance
2 department service regulation fund. On June 30 of any fiscal year during
3 which an amount or amounts are certified and transferred under this
4 subsection, the director of accounts and reports shall provide for the
5 repayment of the amounts so transferred and shall transfer the amount
6 equal to the total of all such amounts transferred during the fiscal year
7 from the insurance department service regulation fund to the state general
8 fund.
9 (g) Any unexpended balance in the insurance department service
10 regulation fund at the close of a fiscal year shall remain credited to the
11 insurance department service regulation fund for use in the succeeding
12 fiscal year and shall be used to reduce future assessments or to
13 accommodate cash flow demands on the fund.
14 (h) The commissioner of insurance shall exempt the assessment of
15 any insurer which that, as of December 31 of the calendar year preceding
16 the assessment, has a surplus of less than two times the minimum amount
17 of surplus required for a certificate of authority on and after May 1, 1994,
18 and which is subject to the premium tax or privilege fee liability imposed
19 on insurers organized under the laws of this state. The commissioner of
20 insurance may also exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of
21 any other insurer if, in the opinion of the commissioner of insurance,
22 immediate payment of the total assessment would be detrimental to the
23 solvency of the insurer.
24 (i) As used in this section:
25 (1) "Affiliates" or "affiliated" has the meaning ascribed by K.S.A. 40-
26 3302, and amendments thereto;

41 any captive insurance company, as defined by K.S.A. 40-4301, and

Raw Text:
As Amended by House Committee
Session of 2025
SENATE BILL No. 32
By Committee on Assessment and Taxation
1-16
1 AN ACT concerning insurance; relating to taxation; reducing insurance
2 company premium tax rates; discontinuing remittance and crediting of
3 a portion of the premium tax to the insurance department service
4 regulation fund; amending K.S.A. 40-112 and 40-252 and repealing the
5 existing sections.
6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 40-112 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
9 112. (a) For the purpose of maintaining the insurance department and the
10 payment of expenses incident thereto, there is hereby established the
11 insurance department service regulation fund in the state treasury, which
12 shall be administered by the commissioner of insurance. All expenditures
13 from the insurance department service regulation fund shall be made in
14 accordance with appropriation acts upon warrants of the director of
15 accounts and reports issued pursuant to vouchers approved by the
16 commissioner of insurance or by a person or persons designated by the
17 commissioner.
18 (b) On and after the effective date of this act January 1, 2026, all fees
19 received by the commissioner of insurance pursuant to any statute and 1%
20 of taxes received pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto,
21 shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of
22 K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such
23 remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state
24 treasury to the credit of the insurance department service regulation fund.
25 (c) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the commissioner of
26 insurance shall make an annual assessment on each group of affiliated
27 insurers whose certificates of authority to do business in this state are in
28 good standing at the time of the assessment. The total amount of all such
29 assessments for a fiscal year shall be equal to the amount sufficient
30 whichthat, when combined with the total amount to be credited to the
31 insurance department service regulation fund pursuant to subsection (b) is
32 equal to the amount approved by the legislature to fund the insurance
33 company regulation program. With respect to each group of affiliated
34 insurers, such assessment shall be in proportion to the amount of total
35 assets of the group of affiliated insurers as reported to the commissioner of
36 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto, for the

SB 32—Am. by HC 2
1 immediately preceding calendar year, shall not be less than $500 and shall
2 not be more than the amount equal to .0000015 of the amount of total
3 assets of the group of affiliated insurers or $25,000, whichever is less. The
4 total assessment for any fiscal year shall not increase by any amount
5 greater than 15% of the total budget approved by the legislature to fund the
6 insurance company regulation program for the fiscal year immediately
7 preceding the fiscal year for which the assessment is made. In the event
8 the total amount of the assessment would be less than the aggregate
9 amount resulting by assessing the $500 minimum on each insurer, the
10 commissioner may establish a lower minimum to be assessed equally on
11 each insurer.
12 (d) If, by the laws of any state other than Kansas or by the retaliatory
13 laws of any state other than Kansas, any insurer domiciled in Kansas shall
14 be required to pay any fee or tax in such other state of licensure, and the
15 fee or tax is due and payable either because the insurance department
16 service regulation fee imposed by this section on insurers licensed in
17 Kansas and organized or domiciled in such other state is greater than the
18 comparable fee or tax assessed in such other state, or such other state has
19 no comparable fee or tax but requires payment on a retaliatory basis, then
20 to the extent such fee or tax amounts are legally due and are paid in such
21 other state, any insurer domiciled in Kansas may claim a dollar-for-dollar
22 credit for such fees paid against insurer's annual premium taxes due the
23 state of Kansas under K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or privilege
24 fee due the state of Kansas under K.S.A. 40-3213, and amendments
25 thereto, but such credit shall only be calculated on the amount which that
26 would not have been required to be paid in such other state of licensure in
27 the absence of the existence of the insurance department service regulation
28 fee imposed by this section, and in no event shall the credit permitted by
29 this section exceed 90% of the insurer's annual premium tax or privilege
30 fee due the state of Kansas. The insurance commissioner shall prescribe
31 the forms for reporting such credits.
32 (e) Assessments payable under this section shall be past due if not
33 paid to the insurance department within 45 days of the billing date of such
34 assessment. A penalty equal to 10% of the amount assessed shall be
35 imposed upon any past due payment and the total amount of the
36 assessment and penalty shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or
37 any portion thereof.
38 (f) When there exists in the insurance department service regulation
39 fund a deficiency which that would render such fund temporarily
40 insufficient during any fiscal year to meet the insurance department's
41 funding requirements, the commissioner of insurance shall certify the
42 amount of the insufficiency. Upon receipt of any such certification, the
43 director of accounts and reports shall transfer an amount of moneys equal

SB 32—Am. by HC 3
1 to the amount so certified from the state general fund to the insurance
2 department service regulation fund. On June 30 of any fiscal year during
3 which an amount or amounts are certified and transferred under this
4 subsection, the director of accounts and reports shall provide for the
5 repayment of the amounts so transferred and shall transfer the amount
6 equal to the total of all such amounts transferred during the fiscal year
7 from the insurance department service regulation fund to the state general
8 fund.
9 (g) Any unexpended balance in the insurance department service
10 regulation fund at the close of a fiscal year shall remain credited to the
11 insurance department service regulation fund for use in the succeeding
12 fiscal year and shall be used to reduce future assessments or to
13 accommodate cash flow demands on the fund.
14 (h) The commissioner of insurance shall exempt the assessment of
15 any insurer which that, as of December 31 of the calendar year preceding
16 the assessment, has a surplus of less than two times the minimum amount
17 of surplus required for a certificate of authority on and after May 1, 1994,
18 and which is subject to the premium tax or privilege fee liability imposed
19 on insurers organized under the laws of this state. The commissioner of
20 insurance may also exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of
21 any other insurer if, in the opinion of the commissioner of insurance,
22 immediate payment of the total assessment would be detrimental to the
23 solvency of the insurer.
24 (i) As used in this section:
25 (1) "Affiliates" or "affiliated" has the meaning ascribed by K.S.A. 40-
26 3302, and amendments thereto;
27 (2) "group" or "group of affiliated insurers" means the affiliated
28 insurers of a group and also includes an individual, unaffiliated insurer;
29 and
30 (3) "insurer" means any insurance company, as defined by K.S.A. 40-
31 201, and amendments thereto, any fraternal benefit society, as defined by
32 K.S.A. 40-738, and amendments thereto, any reciprocal or interinsurance
33 exchange under K.S.A. 40-1601 through 40-1614, and amendments
34 thereto, any mutual insurance company organized to provide health care
35 provider liability insurance under K.S.A. 40-12a01 through 40-12a09, and
36 amendments thereto, any nonprofit dental service corporation under

38 nonprofit medical and hospital service corporation under K.S.A. 40-19c01
39 through 40-19c11, and amendments thereto, any health maintenance
40 organization, as defined by K.S.A. 40-3202, and amendments thereto, or
41 any captive insurance company, as defined by K.S.A. 40-4301, and
42 amendments thereto, which that is authorized to do business in Kansas.
43 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 40-252 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-252.
