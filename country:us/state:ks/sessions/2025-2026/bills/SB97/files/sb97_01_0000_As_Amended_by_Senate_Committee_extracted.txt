20 manner and under the same condition as for an application for a certificate
21 of title under K.S.A. 8-135, and amendments thereto. Such application
22 shall be in the form prescribed by the director of vehicles and shall contain
23 substantially the same provisions as required for an application under
24 K.S.A. 8-135(c)(1), and amendments thereto. In addition, such application
25 shall provide a place for the applicant to certify that the vehicle for which
26 the application for salvage title is made is a salvage vehicle, and other
27 provisions the director deems necessary. Each application for a salvage
28 title shall be accompanied by a fee of $10 and if the application is not
29 made to the county treasurer within the time prescribed by K.S.A. 8-135,
30 and amendments thereto, for making application for a certificate of title
31 thereunder, an additional fee of $2.

5 salvage vehicle.

10 K.S.A. 8-135, and amendments thereto. No regular certificate of title shall

39 this state over the most direct route from the place such salvage vehicle is
