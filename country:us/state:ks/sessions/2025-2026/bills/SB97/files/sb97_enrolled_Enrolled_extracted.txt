Section 3:
198. (a) A nonhighway or salvage vehicle shall not be required to be
registered in this state, as provided in K.S.A. 8-135, and amendments
thereto, but nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating,
limiting or otherwise affecting the provisions of K.S.A. 8-142, and
amendments thereto, which make it unlawful for any person to operate
or knowingly permit the operation in this state of a vehicle required to
be registered in this state.
(b) Upon the sale or transfer of any nonhighway vehicle or salvage

(1) If the vehicle dealer, as defined in K.S.A. 8-2401, and
amendments thereto, obtains ownership of a used vehicle that is an all-
terrain vehicle, work-site utility vehicle, recreational off-highway
vehicle or motorcycle and such vehicle would qualify as a nonhighway
vehicle pursuant to K.S.A. 8-197, and amendments thereto, the vehicle
dealer shall make application to the county treasurer of such county for
a dealer inventory-only title. Each application for a dealer inventory-
only title shall be accompanied by a fee of $10 and either a bill of sale
or certificate of title with the application for the vehicle. All moneys
received under this paragraph shall be remitted as a certificate of title
in accordance with K.S.A. 8-145(b), and amendments thereto.

title, whichever is applicable, to the purchaser of such nonhighway
vehicle or salvage vehicle in the same manner and under the same
conditions prescribed by K.S.A. 8-135, and amendments thereto, for

new nonhighway certificate of title or a salvage title, as provided in
subsection (c) or (d).

owner of such nonhighway vehicle or salvage vehicle may surrender
such certificate of title to the division of vehicles and make application
to the division for a nonhighway certificate of title or salvage title,
whichever is applicable, or the owner may obtain from the county

is located to a specified location named on the permit and to return to
the original location. No such permit shall be issued for any vehicle

which it is issued and shall be displayed so that it is visible from the
rear of the vehicle. The fee for such permit shall be $1 and shall be
retained by the county treasurer.

to this section shall not be deemed a motor vehicle for the purposes of
K.S.A. 40-3101 through 40-3121, and amendments thereto, except
when such vehicle is being operated pursuant to subsection (g). Any
person who knowingly makes a false statement concerning financial
security in obtaining a permit pursuant to subsection (g), or who fails to

pool or salvage vehicle dealer obtains possession of the vehicle;
(B) the insurance claim for the vehicle has been closed without
payment or denied by the insurance company; and
(C) the vehicle has remained unclaimed at the salvage vehicle
pool's or salvage vehicle dealer's facility for more than 30 days.

sufficient evidence that at least two written notices were delivered by
certified mail to the address provided by the division of vehicles'
ownership verification, or through another courier service that provides
proof of delivery, to the owner of the vehicle and any lienholder of the
vehicle identified in the division of vehicles' records requesting that the
vehicle be removed from the salvage vehicle pool's or salvage vehicle
dealer's facility. A salvage vehicle dealer shall also provide sufficient
evidence to the division of the request by the insurance company to
obtain possession of the vehicle. Such written notice shall specify that
the owner of the vehicle and any lienholder of the vehicle identified in
the division of vehicles' records has at least 30 days from the receipt of
the notice to remove the vehicle. If the salvage vehicle pool or salvage
vehicle dealer does not receive proof of delivery for the notices, the
salvage vehicle pool or salvage vehicle dealer shall cause notice of the

salvage vehicle dealer a salvage title or a nonrepairable vehicle
certificate free and clear of all liens, security interests and
encumbrances.

misdemeanor.

ownership verification, or through another courier service that provides
proof of delivery, to the owner of the vehicle and any lienholder of the
vehicle identified in the division of vehicles' records requesting that the
vehicle be removed from the salvage vehicle pool's or salvage vehicle
dealer's facility. A salvage vehicle dealer shall also provide sufficient
evidence to the division of the request by the insurance company to
obtain possession of the vehicle. Such written notice shall specify that
the owner of the vehicle and any lienholder of the vehicle identified in
the division of vehicles' records has at least 30 days from the receipt of
the notice to remove the vehicle. If the salvage vehicle pool or salvage
vehicle dealer does not receive proof of delivery for the notices, the
salvage vehicle pool or salvage vehicle dealer shall cause notice of the
application for an ownership document to be published in a newspaper
of general circulation in the county where the vehicle is located.

issued by this state, the application shall also include evidence of an
inspection of the vehicle completed pursuant to K.S.A. 8-116a, and
amendments thereto. The application shall also indicate whether a
salvage title or a nonrepairable vehicle certificate shall be issued for the
vehicle.

this subsection, the division shall issue to the salvage vehicle pool or
salvage vehicle dealer a salvage title or a nonrepairable vehicle
certificate free and clear of all liens, security interests and
encumbrances.
