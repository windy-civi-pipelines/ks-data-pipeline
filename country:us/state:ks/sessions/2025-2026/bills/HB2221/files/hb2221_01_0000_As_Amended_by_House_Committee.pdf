14 the custody of the secretary of corrections in a facility designated by the
15 secretary for the provision of substance abuse treatment pursuant to the
16 provisions of K.S.A. 21-6804, and amendments thereto. The secretary of
17 corrections may refuse to admit the person to the designated facility and
18 place the person in a different state facility, or admit the person and
19 subsequently transfer the person to a different state facility, if the secretary
20 determines: (i) That substance abuse treatment resources or the capacity of
21 the facility designated by the secretary for the incarceration and treatment
22 of the person is not available; (ii) the person has failed to meaningfully
23 participate in the treatment program of the designated facility; (iii) the
24 person is disruptive to the security or operation of the designated facility;
25 or (iv) the medical or mental health condition of the person renders the
26 person unsuitable for confinement at the designated facility. The
27 determination by the secretary that the person either is not to be admitted
28 into the designated facility or is to be transferred from the designated
29 facility is not subject to review.
30 (B) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), for any
31 conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(D) or (b)(1)(E), if the person is
32 granted probation, the court shall determine whether the person shall be
33 supervised by community correctional services or court services based on
34 the risk and needs of the person. The risk and needs of the person shall be
35 determined by use of a risk assessment tool specified by the Kansas
36 sentencing commission. During the probation supervision, the person shall
37 be required to participate in a multidisciplinary model of services for
38 substance use disorders facilitated by a Kansas department for aging and
39 disability services designated care coordination agency to include
40 assessment and, if appropriate, referral to a community based substance
41 use disorder treatment including recovery management and mental health
42 counseling as needed. The multidisciplinary team shall include the
43 designated care coordination agency, the supervision officer, the Kansas

HB 2221—Am. by HC 5
1 department for aging and disability services designated treatment provider
2 and the person.
3 (3) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), for any
4 conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(C), at the time of the filing of the
5 judgment form or journal entry as required by K.S.A. 21-6711 or 22-3426,
6 and amendments thereto, the court shall cause a certified copy to be sent to
7 the officer having the person in charge. The court shall determine whether
8 the person, upon release from imprisonment, shall be supervised by
9 community correctional services or court services based upon the risk and
10 needs of the person. The risk and needs of the person shall be determined
11 by use of a risk assessment tool specified by the Kansas sentencing
12 commission. The law enforcement agency maintaining custody and control
13 of a person for imprisonment shall cause a certified copy of the judgment
14 form or journal entry to be sent to the supervision office designated by the
15 court and upon expiration of the term of imprisonment shall deliver the
16 person to a location designated by the supervision office designated by the
17 court. After the term of imprisonment imposed by the court, the person
18 shall be placed on supervision to community correctional services or court
19 services, as determined by the court, for a mandatory one-year period of
20 supervision, which such period of supervision shall not be reduced. During
21 such supervision, the person shall be required to participate in a
22 multidisciplinary model of services for substance use disorders facilitated
23 by a Kansas department for aging and disability services designated care
24 coordination agency to include assessment and, if appropriate, referral to a
25 community based substance use disorder treatment including recovery
26 management and mental health counseling as needed. The
27 multidisciplinary team shall include the designated care coordination
28 agency, the supervision officer, the Kansas department for aging and
29 disability services designated treatment provider and the person. A person
30 for whom a warrant has been issued by the court alleging a violation of
31 this supervision shall be considered a fugitive from justice if it is found
32 that the warrant cannot be served. If it is found that the person has violated
33 the provisions of this supervision, the court shall determine whether the
34 time from the issuing of the warrant to the date of the court's determination
35 of an alleged violation, or any part of it, shall be counted as time served on
36 supervision. Any violation of the conditions of such supervision may
37 subject such person to revocation of supervision and imprisonment in jail
38 for the remainder of the period of imprisonment, the remainder of the
39 supervision period, or any combination or portion thereof. The term of
40 supervision may be extended at the court's discretion beyond one year, and
41 any violation of the conditions of such extended term of supervision may
42 subject such person to the revocation of supervision and imprisonment in
43 jail of up to the remainder of the original sentence, not the term of the

HB 2221—Am. by HC 6
1 extended supervision.
2 (4) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), prior to
3 sentencing for any conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)
4 (B), the court shall order the person to participate in an alcohol and drug
5 evaluation conducted by a provider in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1008, and
6 amendments thereto. The person shall be required to follow any
7 recommendation made by the provider after such evaluation, unless
8 otherwise ordered by the court.
9 (c) Any person 18 years of age or older convicted of violating this
10 section or an ordinance which prohibits the acts that this section prohibits
11 who had one or more children under the age of 18 years in the vehicle at
12 the time of the offense shall have such person's punishment enhanced by
13 one month of imprisonment. This imprisonment must be served
14 consecutively to any other minimum mandatory penalty imposed for a
15 violation of this section or an ordinance which prohibits the acts that this
16 section prohibits. Any enhanced penalty imposed shall not exceed the
17 maximum sentence allowable by law. During the service of the enhanced
18 penalty, the judge may order the person on house arrest, work release or
19 other conditional release.
20 (d) If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (a)(4) or (a)
21 (5), the fact that the person is or has been entitled to use the drug under the
22 laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against the charge.
23 (e) The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any
24 fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section. Any
25 assessment and costs shall be required to be paid not later than 90 days
26 after imposed, and any remainder of the fine shall be paid prior to the final
27 release of the person by the court.
28 (f) (1) In lieu of payment of a fine imposed pursuant to this section,
29 the court may order that the person perform community service specified
30 by the court. The person shall receive a credit on the fine imposed in an
31 amount equal to $5 for each full hour spent by the person in the specified
32 community service. The community service ordered by the court shall be
33 required to be performed not later than one year after the fine is imposed
34 or by an earlier date specified by the court. If by the required date the
35 person performs an insufficient amount of community service to reduce to
36 zero the portion of the fine required to be paid by the person, the
37 remaining balance of the fine shall become due on that date.
38 (2) The court may, in its discretion, waive any portion of a fine
39 imposed pursuant to this section, except the $250 required to be remitted
40 to the state treasurer pursuant to subsection (q)(2) (q)(3), upon a showing
41 that the person successfully completed court-ordered education or
42 treatment.
43 (g) Prior to filing a complaint alleging a violation of this section, a

HB 2221—Am. by HC 7

11 provisions of this section, the court shall request and shall receive from the
12 division a record of all prior convictions obtained against such person for
13 any violations of any of the motor vehicle laws of this state.

16 section:
17 (1) Convictions for a violation of this section, or a violation of an
18 ordinance of any city or resolution of any county that prohibits the acts

20 further criminal proceedings on a complaint alleging any such violations,
21 shall be taken into account, but only convictions or diversions occurring
22 on or after July 1, 2001. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as
23 preventing any court from considering any convictions or diversions
24 occurring during the person's lifetime in determining the sentence to be
25 imposed within the limits provided for a first, second, third, fourth or
26 subsequent offense;

14 appropriate county or district attorney for prosecution.
15 (n) No plea bargaining agreement shall be entered into nor shall any
16 judge approve a plea bargaining agreement entered into for the purpose of
17 permitting a person charged with a violation of this section, or a violation
