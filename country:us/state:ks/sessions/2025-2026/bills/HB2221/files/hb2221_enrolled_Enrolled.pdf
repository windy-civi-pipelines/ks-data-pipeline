state facility in the custody of the secretary of corrections in a facility
designated by the secretary for the provision of substance abuse
treatment pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 21-6804, and
amendments thereto. The secretary of corrections may refuse to admit
the person to the designated facility and place the person in a different
state facility, or admit the person and subsequently transfer the person
to a different state facility, if the secretary determines: (i) That
substance abuse treatment resources or the capacity of the facility
designated by the secretary for the incarceration and treatment of the
person is not available; (ii) the person has failed to meaningfully
participate in the treatment program of the designated facility; (iii) the
person is disruptive to the security or operation of the designated
facility; or (iv) the medical or mental health condition of the person
renders the person unsuitable for confinement at the designated facility.
The determination by the secretary that the person either is not to be
admitted into the designated facility or is to be transferred from the
designated facility is not subject to review.
(B) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), for any
conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(D) or (b)(1)(E), if the person is
granted probation, the court shall determine whether the person shall be
supervised by community correctional services or court services based
on the risk and needs of the person. The risk and needs of the person
shall be determined by use of a risk assessment tool specified by the
Kansas sentencing commission. During the probation supervision, the
person shall be required to participate in a multidisciplinary model of
services for substance use disorders facilitated by a Kansas department
for aging and disability services designated care coordination agency to
include assessment and, if appropriate, referral to a community based
substance use disorder treatment including recovery management and
mental health counseling as needed. The multidisciplinary team shall
include the designated care coordination agency, the supervision
officer, the Kansas department for aging and disability services
designated treatment provider and the person.
(3) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), for any
conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(C), at the time of the filing of
the judgment form or journal entry as required by K.S.A. 21-6711 or
22-3426, and amendments thereto, the court shall cause a certified copy
to be sent to the officer having the person in charge. The court shall
determine whether the person, upon release from imprisonment, shall
be supervised by community correctional services or court services
based upon the risk and needs of the person. The risk and needs of the
person shall be determined by use of a risk assessment tool specified by
the Kansas sentencing commission. The law enforcement agency
maintaining custody and control of a person for imprisonment shall

HOUSE BILL No. 2221—page 4
cause a certified copy of the judgment form or journal entry to be sent
to the supervision office designated by the court and upon expiration of
the term of imprisonment shall deliver the person to a location
designated by the supervision office designated by the court. After the
term of imprisonment imposed by the court, the person shall be placed
on supervision to community correctional services or court services, as
determined by the court, for a mandatory one-year period of
supervision, which such period of supervision shall not be reduced.
During such supervision, the person shall be required to participate in a
multidisciplinary model of services for substance use disorders
facilitated by a Kansas department for aging and disability services
designated care coordination agency to include assessment and, if
appropriate, referral to a community based substance use disorder
treatment including recovery management and mental health
counseling as needed. The multidisciplinary team shall include the
designated care coordination agency, the supervision officer, the
Kansas department for aging and disability services designated
treatment provider and the person. A person for whom a warrant has
been issued by the court alleging a violation of this supervision shall be
considered a fugitive from justice if it is found that the warrant cannot
be served. If it is found that the person has violated the provisions of
this supervision, the court shall determine whether the time from the
issuing of the warrant to the date of the court's determination of an
alleged violation, or any part of it, shall be counted as time served on
supervision. Any violation of the conditions of such supervision may
subject such person to revocation of supervision and imprisonment in
jail for the remainder of the period of imprisonment, the remainder of
the supervision period, or any combination or portion thereof. The term
of supervision may be extended at the court's discretion beyond one
year, and any violation of the conditions of such extended term of
supervision may subject such person to the revocation of supervision
and imprisonment in jail of up to the remainder of the original sentence,
not the term of the extended supervision.
(4) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), prior to
sentencing for any conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)
(B), the court shall order the person to participate in an alcohol and
drug evaluation conducted by a provider in accordance with K.S.A. 8-
1008, and amendments thereto. The person shall be required to follow
any recommendation made by the provider after such evaluation, unless
otherwise ordered by the court.
(c) Any person 18 years of age or older convicted of violating this
section or an ordinance which prohibits the acts that this section
prohibits who had one or more children under the age of 18 years in the
vehicle at the time of the offense shall have such person's punishment
enhanced by one month of imprisonment. This imprisonment must be
served consecutively to any other minimum mandatory penalty
imposed for a violation of this section or an ordinance which prohibits
the acts that this section prohibits. Any enhanced penalty imposed shall
not exceed the maximum sentence allowable by law. During the service
of the enhanced penalty, the judge may order the person on house
arrest, work release or other conditional release.
(d) If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (a)(4) or
(a)(5), the fact that the person is or has been entitled to use the drug
under the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against the
charge.
(e) The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any
fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section. Any
assessment and costs shall be required to be paid not later than 90 days
after imposed, and any remainder of the fine shall be paid prior to the

HOUSE BILL No. 2221—page 5
final release of the person by the court.
(f) (1) In lieu of payment of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section, the court may order that the person perform community service
specified by the court. The person shall receive a credit on the fine
imposed in an amount equal to $5 for each full hour spent by the person
in the specified community service. The community service ordered by
the court shall be required to be performed not later than one year after
the fine is imposed or by an earlier date specified by the court. If by the
required date the person performs an insufficient amount of community
service to reduce to zero the portion of the fine required to be paid by
the person, the remaining balance of the fine shall become due on that
date.
(2) The court may, in its discretion, waive any portion of a fine
imposed pursuant to this section, except the $250 required to be
remitted to the state treasurer pursuant to subsection (q)(2) (q)(3), upon
a showing that the person successfully completed court-ordered
education or treatment.

person for any violations of any of the motor vehicle laws of this state;

sentencing under the provisions of this section, the court shall request
and shall receive from the division a record of all prior convictions
obtained against such person for any violations of any of the motor
vehicle laws of this state.
(i) For the purpose of determining whether a conviction is a first,
second, third, fourth or subsequent conviction in sentencing under this
section:
(1) Convictions for a violation of this section, or a violation of an
ordinance of any city or resolution of any county that prohibits the acts
that this section prohibits, or entering into a diversion agreement in lieu
of further criminal proceedings on a complaint alleging any such
violations, shall be taken into account, but only convictions or
diversions occurring on or after July 1, 2001. Nothing in this provision
shall be construed as preventing any court from considering any
convictions or diversions occurring during the person's lifetime in
determining the sentence to be imposed within the limits provided for a
first, second, third, fourth or subsequent offense;
(2) any convictions for a violation of the following sections
occurring during a person's lifetime shall be taken into account:
(A) Driving a commercial motor vehicle under the influence,

and amendments thereto;
(3) "conviction" includes:
(A) Entering into a diversion agreement in lieu of further criminal
proceedings on a complaint alleging an offense described in subsection
(i)(2); and
(B) conviction of a violation of an ordinance of a city in this state,
a resolution of a county in this state or any law of another jurisdiction
that would constitute an offense that is comparable to the offense
described in subsection (i)(1) or (i)(2);
(4) multiple convictions of any crime described in subsection (i)
(1) or (i)(2) arising from the same arrest shall only be counted as one
conviction;
(5) it is irrelevant whether an offense occurred before or after

criminal proceedings for a violation of this section, and amendments

conviction, shall suspend, restrict or suspend and restrict the person's
driving privileges as provided by K.S.A. 8-1014, and amendments
thereto.
(l) (1) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any city from enacting ordinances, or any county from
adopting resolutions, declaring acts prohibited or made unlawful by this
act as unlawful or prohibited in such city or county and prescribing
penalties for violation thereof.
(2) The minimum penalty prescribed by any such ordinance or
resolution shall not be less than the minimum penalty prescribed by this
section for the same violation, and the maximum penalty in any such
ordinance or resolution shall not exceed the maximum penalty
prescribed for the same violation.
(3) On and after July 1, 2007, and retroactive for ordinance
violations committed on or after July 1, 2006, an ordinance may grant

violation of this section, notwithstanding that the elements of such
ordinance violation are the same as the elements of a violation of this
section that would constitute, and be punished as, a felony.

any judge approve a plea bargaining agreement entered into for the
purpose of permitting a person charged with a violation of this section,
or a violation of any ordinance of a city or resolution of any county in
this state which prohibits the acts prohibited by this section, to avoid
the mandatory penalties established by this section or by the ordinance.
For the purpose of this subsection, entering into a diversion agreement
pursuant to K.S.A. 12-4413 et seq. or 22-2906 et seq., and amendments

be construed to prohibit an amendment or dismissal of any charge
where the admissible evidence is not sufficient to support a conviction
beyond a reasonable doubt on such charge.
(o) The alternatives set out in subsection (a) may be pleaded in the
alternative, and the state, city or county may, but shall not be required
to, elect one or more of such alternatives prior to submission of the case
to the fact finder.
