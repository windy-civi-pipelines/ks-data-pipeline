(1) The reasonable probability of usefulness and success of the
contracting trustee; and
(2) the financial history and condition of the contracting trustee
including the character, qualifications and experience of the officers
employed by the contracting trustee.
(i)(j) The commissioner shall render approval or disapproval of
the application within 90 days of receiving a complete application.
(j)(k) Upon service of an order denying an application, the
applicant shall have the right to a hearing to be conducted in
accordance with the Kansas administrative procedure act before the
state banking board. Any final order of the commissioner pursuant to
this section is subject to review in accordance with the Kansas judicial
review act.
(k)(l) When the commissioner determines that any contracting
trustee domiciled in this state has entered into a contracting agreement
in violation of the laws governing the operation of such contracting
trustee, the commissioner may take such action as available under
K.S.A. 9-1714, 9-1805, 9-1807 or 9-1809, and amendments thereto, to
remedy such violation.
(l)(m) Any party entitled to receive a notice under subsection (f)
(5)(3) may file a petition in the court having jurisdiction over the
fiduciary relationship, or if none, in the district court in the county
where the originating trustee has its principal office, seeking to remove
any contracting trustee substituted or about to be substituted as
fiduciary pursuant to this section. Unless the contracting trustee files a

concerned and shall fashion such relief as the court deems appropriate
in the circumstances, including the awarding of reasonable attorney
fees. The right to file a petition under this subsection shall be in
addition to any other rights to remove the fiduciary provided by any
other statute or regulation or by the writing creating the fiduciary
relationship. If the removal of the fiduciary is prompted solely as a
result of the contracting agreement, any reasonable cost associated with
such removal and transfer shall be paid by the originating trustee or
financial institution entering into the agreement.
Sec. 8. K.S.A. 9-2108 is hereby amended to read as follows: 9-
2108. It is unlawful for any trust company to establish or operate a trust
service office or relocate an existing trust service office except as
provided herein.
(a) As used in this section: "Trust service office" means any office,
agency or other place of business located within this state, other than
the place of business specified in the trust company's certificate of
authority, at which the powers granted to trust companies under K.S.A.
9-2103, and amendments thereto, are exercised. For the purposes of
this section, any activity in compliance with K.S.A. 9-2107, and
amendments thereto, does not constitute a trust service office.

SENATE BILL No. 139—page 11
(b) After first applying for and obtaining the approval of the
commissioner under this section, one or more trust service offices may
be established or operated in any city within this state by a trust
company incorporated under the laws of this state.
(c) An application to establish or operate a trust service office or
to relocate an existing trust service office shall be in the form and
manner prescribed by the commissioner and provide the following

(2) all other required regulatory approvals;
(3) proof of publication of notice that the applicant intends to file
or has filed an application pursuant to this section. The notice shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation where the proposed
trust service office is to be located. The notice shall be in the form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain the name of the
applicant, the location of the proposed trust service office and a
solicitation for written comments. The notice shall be published on the
same day and every day thereafter for two consecutive weeks and
provide for a comment period of not less than 10 days after the date of
the second publication; and
(4) the application shall include the name selected for the
proposed trust service office. The name selected for the proposed trust
service office shall not be the same or substantially similar to the name
of any other trust company or trust service office doing business in the
state of Kansas, nor shall the name selected be required to contain the
name of the applicant trust company. If the name selected for the
proposed trust service office does not contain the name of the applicant
trust company, the trust service office shall provide in the public lobby
of such trust service office, a public notice that it is a trust service
office of the applicant trust company. Any trust company may request
an exemption from the commissioner from the provisions of this
subsection.
(d) A trust company making application to the commissioner for
approval of a trust service office under this section shall pay to the
commissioner a fee, in an amount established pursuant to K.S.A. 9-
1726, and amendments thereto, to defray the expenses of the
commissioner in the examination and investigation of the application.
The commissioner shall remit all moneys received under this section to
the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215,
and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the
state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the
credit of the bank investigation fund. The moneys in the bank
investigation fund shall be used to pay the expenses of the
commissioner or designee in the examination and investigation of such
applications and any unused balance shall be transferred to the bank
commissioner fee fund.
(e) Upon the request of any trust company proposing to relocate
an existing trust service office to less than one mile 10 miles from the
trust company's existing location, the commissioner may exempt such
trust company from the requirements of this section. If an exemption is
provided under this subsection, each trust company shall document the
written action taken by the board of directors of the trust company
approving the proposed relocation of the trust service office and all
other required regulatory approvals.
(f) Upon the filing of a complete application with the
commissioner, the commissioner shall make or cause to be made, a

SENATE BILL No. 139—page 12
careful examination and investigation. If the commissioner finds any of
the following matters unfavorably, the commissioner may deny the
application:
(1) The reasonable probability of usefulness and success of the
proposed trust service office; and
(2) the applicant trust company's financial history and condition
including the character, qualifications and experience of the officers
employed by the trust company.
(g) Upon service of an order denying an application, the applicant
shall have the right to a hearing to be conducted in accordance with the
Kansas administrative procedure act before the state banking board.
Any final order of the state banking board pursuant to this section is
subject to review in accordance with the Kansas judicial review act.
(h) When the commissioner determines that a trust company
domiciled in this state has established or is operating a trust service
office in violation of the laws governing the operation of such trust
company, the commissioner may take such action as available under
K.S.A. 9-1714, 9-1805, 9-1807 or 9-1809, and amendments thereto, to
remedy such violation.
Sec. 9. K.S.A. 9-2111 is hereby amended to read as follows: 9-
2111. (a) Except as provided in K.S.A. 9-2107, and amendments
thereto, no trust company, trust department of a bank, corporation or
other business entity, the with a home office of which is located outside
the state of Kansas, shall establish or operate a trust facility within the
state of Kansas, unless the laws of the state where the home office of
the nonresident trust company, trust department of a bank, corporation
or other business entity is located authorize a Kansas chartered Kansas-
chartered trust company, trust department of a bank, corporation or
other business entity to establish or operate a trust facility within that
state. The commissioner may require any nonresident trust company to
meet the greater of the requirements stated under the banking code or
the laws of the nonresident trust company's home state required for a
Kansas trust company to do business in the nonresident trust
company's home state.
(b) Before any nonresident trust company, trust department of a
bank, corporation or other business entity establishes a trust facility in
Kansas, a copy of the application submitted to the home state, and
proof that the home state authorizes a Kansas chartered Kansas-
chartered trust company, trust department of a bank, corporation or
other business entity to establish or operate a trust facility within that
state, must shall be filed by the applicant with the commissioner.
(c) No Kansas trust company shall establish an out-of-state trust
facility until an application has been filed with the commissioner and
approval has been received. An application filed pursuant to this section
shall be subject to the provisions in K.S.A. 9-2108, and amendments
thereto.
(d) No Kansas bank with a trust department shall establish an out-
of-state trust facility until an application has been filed with the
commissioner and approval has been received. An application filed
pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions in K.S.A. 9-
1111, and amendments thereto.
(e) As used in this section, "trust facility" means any office,
agency, desk or other place of business at which trust where business is
conducted.
(f) Any Kansas trust company or Kansas bank making application
to the commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) shall pay to the
commissioner a fee to be established pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1726, and
amendments thereto, to defray the expenses of the commissioner in the
examination and investigation of the application. The commissioner

SENATE BILL No. 139—page 13
shall remit all moneys received under this section to the state treasurer
in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments
thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall
deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit of the bank
investigation fund. The moneys in the bank investigation fund shall be
used to pay the expenses of the commissioner in the examination and
investigation of such applications and any unused balance shall be
transferred to the bank commissioner fee fund.
Sec. 10. K.S.A. 9-519, 9-1111, 9-1114, 9-1724, 9-1807, 9-2011, 9-
