17 receive a distribution of principle or income from a fiduciary account
18 affected by the agreement, and that such notice was sent to each such
19 person's address as shown in the originating trustee's records. An
20 unintentional failure to give such notice shall not impair the validity or

4 thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall
5 deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit of the bank
6 investigation fund. The moneys in the bank investigation fund shall be
7 used to pay the expenses of the commissioner, or designee, in the
8 examination and investigation of such applications and any unused balance
9 shall be transferred to the bank commissioner fee fund.
10 (h)(i) Upon the filing of a complete application with the
11 commissioner, the commissioner shall make or cause to be made, a careful
12 examination and investigation of the proposed agreement. If the

26 review in accordance with the Kansas judicial review act.
27 (k)(l) When the commissioner determines that any contracting trustee
28 domiciled in this state has entered into a contracting agreement in violation
29 of the laws governing the operation of such contracting trustee, the
30 commissioner may take such action as available under K.S.A. 9-1714, 9-
31 1805, 9-1807 or 9-1809, and amendments thereto, to remedy such
32 violation.
33 (l)(m) Any party entitled to receive a notice under subsection (f)(5)
34 (3) may file a petition in the court having jurisdiction over the fiduciary
35 relationship, or if none, in the district court in the county where the
36 originating trustee has its principal office, seeking to remove any
37 contracting trustee substituted or about to be substituted as fiduciary
38 pursuant to this section. Unless the contracting trustee files a written
39 consent to its removal or a written declination to act subsequent to the
40 filing of the petition, the court, upon notice and hearing, shall determine
41 the best interest of the petitioner and all other parties concerned and shall
42 fashion such relief as the court deems appropriate in the circumstances,
43 including the awarding of reasonable attorney fees. The right to file a

SB 139 14
1 petition under this subsection shall be in addition to any other rights to
2 remove the fiduciary provided by any other statute or regulation or by the
3 writing creating the fiduciary relationship. If the removal of the fiduciary

5 cost associated with such removal and transfer shall be paid by the
6 originating trustee or financial institution entering into the agreement.
7 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 9-2108 is hereby amended to read as follows: 9-2108.
8 It is unlawful for any trust company to establish or operate a trust service
9 office or relocate an existing trust service office except as provided herein.
10 (a) As used in this section: "Trust service office" means any office,

12 place of business specified in the trust company's certificate of authority, at
13 which the powers granted to trust companies under K.S.A. 9-2103, and
14 amendments thereto, are exercised. For the purposes of this section, any
15 activity in compliance with K.S.A. 9-2107, and amendments thereto, does
16 not constitute a trust service office.
17 (b) After first applying for and obtaining the approval of the
18 commissioner under this section, one or more trust service offices may be
19 established or operated in any city within this state by a trust company
20 incorporated under the laws of this state.
21 (c) An application to establish or operate a trust service office or to
22 relocate an existing trust service office shall be in the form and manner
23 prescribed by the commissioner and provide the following documents:
24 (1) A certified copy of the written action taken by the board of

33 the commissioner and shall contain the name of the applicant, the location
34 of the proposed trust service office and a solicitation for written comments.

41 company or trust service office doing business in the state of Kansas, nor
42 shall the name selected be required to contain the name of the applicant
43 trust company. If the name selected for the proposed trust service office

SB 139 15
1 does not contain the name of the applicant trust company, the trust service
2 office shall provide in the public lobby of such trust service office, a public
3 notice that it is a trust service office of the applicant trust company. Any
4 trust company may request an exemption from the commissioner from the
5 provisions of this subsection.
6 (d) A trust company making application to the commissioner for
7 approval of a trust service office under this section shall pay to the
8 commissioner a fee, in an amount established pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1726,
9 and amendments thereto, to defray the expenses of the commissioner in
10 the examination and investigation of the application. The commissioner
11 shall remit all moneys received under this section to the state treasurer in
12 accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments
13 thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall
14 deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit of the bank
15 investigation fund. The moneys in the bank investigation fund shall be
16 used to pay the expenses of the commissioner or designee in the
17 examination and investigation of such applications and any unused balance
18 shall be transferred to the bank commissioner fee fund.
19 (e) Upon the request of any trust company proposing to relocate an
20 existing trust service office to less than one mile 10 miles from the trust
21 company's existing location, the commissioner may exempt such trust
22 company from the requirements of this section. If an exemption is
23 provided under this subsection, each trust company shall document the
24 written action taken by the board of directors of the trust company
25 approving the proposed relocation of the trust service office and all other
26 required regulatory approvals.
27 (f) Upon the filing of a complete application with the commissioner,
28 the commissioner shall make or cause to be made, a careful examination
29 and investigation. If the commissioner finds any of the following matters
30 unfavorably, the commissioner may deny the application:
31 (1) The reasonable probability of usefulness and success of the
32 proposed trust service office; and
33 (2) the applicant trust company's financial history and condition
34 including the character, qualifications and experience of the officers
35 employed by the trust company.
36 (g) Upon service of an order denying an application, the applicant
37 shall have the right to a hearing to be conducted in accordance with the
38 Kansas administrative procedure act before the state banking board. Any
39 final order of the state banking board pursuant to this section is subject to
40 review in accordance with the Kansas judicial review act.
41 (h) When the commissioner determines that a trust company
42 domiciled in this state has established or is operating a trust service office
43 in violation of the laws governing the operation of such trust company, the

SB 139 16
1 commissioner may take such action as available under K.S.A. 9-1714, 9-
2 1805, 9-1807 or 9-1809, and amendments thereto, to remedy such
3 violation.
4 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 9-2111 is hereby amended to read as follows: 9-2111.

6 company, trust department of a bank, corporation or other business entity,

10 company, trust department of a bank, corporation or other business entity
11 is located authorize a Kansas chartered Kansas-chartered trust company,
12 trust department of a bank, corporation or other business entity to establish

15 stated under the banking code or the laws of the nonresident trust
16 company's home state required for a Kansas trust company to do business
17 in the nonresident trust company's home state.

19 corporation or other business entity establishes a trust facility in Kansas, a
20 copy of the application submitted to the home state, and proof that the
21 home state authorizes a Kansas chartered Kansas-chartered trust company,
22 trust department of a bank, corporation or other business entity to establish
23 or operate a trust facility within that state, must shall be filed by the
24 applicant with the commissioner.
25 (c) No Kansas trust company shall establish an out-of-state trust
26 facility until an application has been filed with the commissioner and
27 approval has been received. An application filed pursuant to this section
28 shall be subject to the provisions in K.S.A. 9-2108, and amendments
29 thereto.
30 (d) No Kansas bank with a trust department shall establish an out-of-
31 state trust facility until an application has been filed with the commissioner
32 and approval has been received. An application filed pursuant to this
33 section shall be subject to the provisions in K.S.A. 9-1111, and
34 amendments thereto.
35 (e) As used in this section, "trust facility" means any office, agency,
36 desk or other place of business at which trust where business is conducted.
37 (f) Any Kansas trust company or Kansas bank making application to
38 the commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) shall pay to the
39 commissioner a fee to be established pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1726, and

41 examination and investigation of the application. The commissioner shall
42 remit all moneys received under this section to the state treasurer in
43 accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments

SB 139 17
1 thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall
2 deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit of the bank
3 investigation fund. The moneys in the bank investigation fund shall be
4 used to pay the expenses of the commissioner in the examination and
5 investigation of such applications and any unused balance shall be
6 transferred to the bank commissioner fee fund.

8 2101, 9-2108, 9-2111 and 16-842 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 9-2107 are
