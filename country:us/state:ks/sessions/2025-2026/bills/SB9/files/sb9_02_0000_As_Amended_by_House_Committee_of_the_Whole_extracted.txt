23 court shall determine whether the proposed forfeiture is unconstitutionally
24 excessive pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto, if the
25 court has not made such determination earlier in the proceeding as a result
26 of a petition filed pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto.
27 New Sec. 12. (a) In addition to the provisions of K.S.A. 75-3739, and

3 necessitating such acquisition;
4 (2) the agreement for such acquisition is approved by the secretary of
5 administration after consultation with the adjutant general; and
6 (3) failure to acquire such critical components or otherwise address
7 the needs of the governmental agency would pose a greater threat to the

9 acquisition agreement.
10 (d) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any contract or
11 agreement entered into prior to July 1, 2025.

13 Sec. 11. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 60-4106 is hereby amended to read as
14 follows: 60-4106. (a) Except as provided in this subsection, all property,
15 including all interests in property, described in K.S.A. 60-4105, and
16 amendments thereto, is subject to forfeiture subject to all mortgages, deeds
17 of trust, financing statements or security agreements properly of record
18 prior to the forfeiture held by an interest holder.
19 (1) No real property or conveyance, or an interest therein, may be
20 forfeited under this act unless the offense or conduct giving rise to
21 forfeiture constitutes a felony, except as provided in the Kansas land and
22 military installation protection act, section 1 et seq., and amendments
23 thereto.
24 (2) No conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the
25 transaction of business as a common carrier is subject to forfeiture under
26 this act unless the owner or other person in charge of the conveyance is a
27 consenting party or privy to a violation of this act.
28 (3) No property is subject to forfeiture under this act if the owner or
29 interest holder acquired the property before or during the conduct giving
30 rise to the property's forfeiture, and such owner or interest holder:
31 (A) Did not know and could not have reasonably known of the act or
32 omission or that it was likely to occur; or
33 (B) acted reasonably to prevent the conduct giving rise to forfeiture.
34 (4) No property is subject to forfeiture if the owner or interest holder
35 acquired the property after the conduct giving rise to the property's
36 forfeiture, including acquisition of proceeds of conduct giving rise to
37 forfeiture, and such owner or interest holder:
38 (A) Acquired the property in good faith, for value; and
39 (B) was not knowingly taking part in an illegal transaction.
40 (5) (A) An interest in property acquired in good faith by an attorney
41 as reasonable payment or to secure payment for legal services in a criminal
42 matter relating to violations of this act or for the reimbursement of
43 reasonable expenses related to the legal services is exempt from forfeiture

SB 9—Am. by HCW 10
1 unless before the interest was acquired the attorney knew of a judicial
2 determination of probable cause that the property is subject to forfeiture.
3 (B) The state bears the burden of proving that an exemption claimed
4 under this section is not applicable. Evidence made available by the
5 compelled disclosure of confidential communications between an attorney
6 and a client other than nonprivileged information relating to attorney fees,
7 is not admissible to satisfy the state's burden of proof.
8 (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), property is not exempt from
9 forfeiture, even though the owner or interest holder lacked knowledge or
10 reason to know that the conduct giving rise to property's forfeiture had
11 occurred or was likely to occur, if the:
12 (1) Person whose conduct gave rise to the property's forfeiture had
13 authority to convey the property of the person claiming the exemption to a
14 good faith purchaser for value at the time of the conduct;
15 (2) owner or interest holder is criminally responsible for the conduct
16 giving rise to the property's forfeiture, whether or not there is a prosecution
17 or conviction; or
18 (3) owner or interest holder acquired the property with notice of the
19 property's actual or constructive seizure for forfeiture under this act, or
20 with reason to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this
21 act.
22 (c) Prior to final judgment in a judicial forfeiture proceeding, the
23 court shall determine whether the proposed forfeiture is unconstitutionally
24 excessive pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto, if the
25 court has not made such determination earlier in the proceeding as a result
26 of a petition filed pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto.
27 New Sec. 12. (a) In addition to the provisions of K.S.A. 75-3739, and
28 amendments thereto, and any other applicable statutes concerning
29 purchases, a governmental agency shall not purchase or acquire any drone
30 or any related services, maintenance agreements or equipment, the critical
31 components of which were:
32 (1) Produced in any country of concern; or
33 (2) produced or owned by any foreign principal.
34 (b) Any critical components for drones or any related services or
35 equipment that were acquired prior to July 1, 2025, and that are not in
36 compliance with subsection (a) may continue to be used by the
37 governmental agency that acquired such critical components. When a
38 governmental agency determines that a critical component must be
39 replaced, the governmental agency may use any replacement component
40 acquired prior to July 1, 2025, but no new replacement component shall be
41 acquired from any foreign principal.
42 (c) Any acquisition that is otherwise prohibited under subsection (a)
43 or (b) may be completed by a governmental agency if:

SB 9—Am. by HCW 11
1 (1) There is no other reasonable means to acquire such critical
2 components or of addressing the needs of the governmental agency
3 necessitating such acquisition;
4 (2) the agreement for such acquisition is approved by the secretary of
5 administration after consultation with the adjutant general; and
6 (3) failure to acquire such critical components or otherwise address
7 the needs of the governmental agency would pose a greater threat to the
8 safety and security of this state than that posed by entering into such
9 acquisition agreement.
10 (d) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any contract or
11 agreement entered into prior to July 1, 2025.
