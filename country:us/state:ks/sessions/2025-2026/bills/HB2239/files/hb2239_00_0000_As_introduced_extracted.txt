12 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
13 Section 1. (a) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, every
14 employer shall provide each employee with a meal period of not less than
15 30 continuous minutes during which the employee is relieved of all duties,
16 including any duty to remain on the work premises. This requirement shall
17 apply to each employee work period that is at least six hours but not more
18 than eight hours.
19 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if an employee is not
20 relieved of all duties for 30 continuous minutes during the meal period, the
21 employer shall pay the employee for the entire 30-minute meal period.
22 (3) An employer is not required to provide a meal period to an
23 employee for a work period of less than six hours. When an employee's
24 work period is more than eight hours, the employer shall provide the
25 employee the number of meal periods as follows:
26 Length of work period Number of meal
27 periods required
28 2 hrs or less..........................................................0
29 2 hrs 1 min - 5 hrs 59 min....................................0

HB 2239 2
1 22 hrs....................................................................3
2 22 hrs 1 min - 24 hrs............................................3
3 (4) The meal period shall be taken between the conclusion of the first
4 hour worked and completed prior to the commencement of the final hour
5 worked.
6 (b) (1) If an employer does not provide a meal period to an employee
7 pursuant to subsection (a), the employer shall show that:
8 (A) To do so would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the
9 employer's business as provided in subsection (c) and that the employer
10 has complied with subsection (d);
11 (B) industry practice or custom has established a paid meal period of
12 less than 30 minutes but not less than 20 minutes, during which employees
13 are relieved of all duties; or
14 (C) such employer's business operation encountered unforeseeable
15 equipment failures, acts of nature or other exceptional and unanticipated
16 circumstances that only rarely and temporarily preclude the provision of a
17 meal period required under subsection (a). If an employee is not relieved
18 of all duties for 30 continuous minutes during the meal period, the
19 employer shall pay the employee for the entire 30-minute meal period.
20 (2) The exemption allowed under this subsection shall not be
21 applicable to employees under the age of 16.
22 (c) As used in subsection (b), "undue hardship" means significant
23 difficulty or expense when considered in relation to the size, financial
24 resources, nature or structure of the employer's business. To determine
25 whether providing a meal period requires significant difficulty or expense,
26 the following factors may be considered:
27 (1) The employer's cost of complying with the requirement to provide
28 a meal period under subsection (a);
29 (2) the overall financial resources of the employer;
30 (3) the number of persons employed at the particular worksite and
31 their qualifications to relieve the employee, the total number of persons
32 employed by the employer and the number, type and geographic
33 separateness of the employer's worksites; and
34 (4) the effect of providing the meal period required under subsection
35 (a) on worksite operations involving:
36 (A) The startup or shutdown of machinery in continuous-operation
37 industrial processes;
38 (B) intermittent and unpredictable workflow not in the control of the
39 employer or employee;
40 (C) the perishable nature of materials used on the job; and
41 (D) the safety and health of other employees, patients, clients or the
42 public.
43 (d) When an employer does not provide a meal period to an employee
HB 2239 3
1 pursuant to this section but qualifies for an exemption pursuant to
2 subsection (b):
3 (1) The employer shall instead provide the employee adequate paid
4 periods in which to rest, consume a meal and use the restroom; and
5 (2) the employer shall first provide to each employee a notice from
6 the secretary of labor regarding rest and meal periods in the language used
7 by the employer to communicate with the employee. The employer shall
8 retain and keep available to the secretary a copy of the notice for the
9 duration of the employee's employment and for not less than six months
10 after the termination date of such employee. Notices that comply with this
11 subsection shall be available upon request from the department.
12 (e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), every employer shall
13 provide to each employee for each segment, or a significant part thereof,
14 of four hours worked in a work period a rest period of not less than 15
15 continuous minutes during which the employee is relieved of all duties,
16 except that such employee may be required to remain on the work
17 premises without incurring a deduction from the employee's pay.
18 (A) As the nature of the work allows, the employer shall provide the
19 rest period approximately in the middle of each segment, or a major part
20 thereof, of four hours worked in a work period. When the employee's work
21 period is more than eight hours, the employer shall provide the employee
22 the number of rest periods as follows:
23 Length of work period Number of rest
24 breaks required
25 2 hrs or less..........................................................0
26 2 hrs 1 min - 5 hrs 59 min....................................1
27 6 hrs......................................................................1
28 6 hrs 1 min - 10 hrs..............................................2
29 10 hrs 1 min - 13 hrs 59 min................................3
30 14 hrs....................................................................3
31 14 hrs 1 min - 18 hrs............................................4
32 18 hrs 1 min - 21 hrs 59 min................................5
33 22 hrs....................................................................5
34 22 hrs 1 min - 24 hrs............................................6
35 (B) The employer shall provide rest periods in addition to and taken
36 separately from the time provided for a meal period. An employer may not
37 require or allow an employee to add the rest period to a meal period or
38 deduct the rest period from the beginning or end of the employee's work

11 periods may be modified by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement

13 employees specifically prescribe rules concerning meal periods and rest
14 periods.
15 (g) (1) If an employer agrees, an employee may waive a meal period

18 tips and reports the tips to the employee's employer;
19 (B) the employee is at least 18 years of age;

24 employee, on a form provided by the secretary, and is signed and dated by

26 (E) the employer retains and keeps available to the secretary a copy

30 (F) the employee is provided with a reasonable opportunity to

2 the employee to waive the employee's meal periods by providing to the
3 other at least seven calendar days' written notice.
4 (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), an employee who has requested to
5 waive meal periods under this section may request to take a meal period
6 without revoking the agreement to waive such periods. The request to take
7 a meal period shall be submitted in writing to the employer not less than
8 24 hours prior to the meal period requested.
9 (4) An employer may not coerce an employee into waiving a meal
10 period.
11 (5) An employer shall be considered to have coerced an employee
