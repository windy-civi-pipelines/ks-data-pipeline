under the open records act;
(C) is confidential or privileged under state or federal law or court
rule; or
(D) is disclosed due to a corrupt motive rather than a good faith
concern for a wrongful activity.
(e) (1) Except for officers or employees eligible to
administratively appeal disciplinary actions pursuant to paragraph (2),
any officer or employee of a municipality who alleges that disciplinary
action has been taken against such officer or employee in violation of
this section may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction

damages and any other equitable relief the court deems necessary. The
court may award the prevailing party in the action all or a portion of the
costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees and witness fees.
(2) In any municipality that creates an administrative process to
adjudicate disciplinary actions against employees of the municipality,
any officer or employee of the municipality who is eligible to appeal
disciplinary actions to such adjudicative body may appeal to such body
whenever such officer or employee alleges that disciplinary action was
taken against such officer or employee in violation of this act. The
appeal shall be filed within 90 days after the alleged disciplinary action.
If such body finds that the disciplinary action taken was unreasonable,
such body shall modify or reverse the municipality's action and order
such relief for the employee as such body considers appropriate. Any
party may appeal a decision of such governing body under the Kansas
judicial review act, K.S.A. 77-601 et seq., and amendments thereto.
