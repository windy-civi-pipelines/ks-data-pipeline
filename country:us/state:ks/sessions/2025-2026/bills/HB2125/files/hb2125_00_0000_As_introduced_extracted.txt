22 Phillips county pursuant to the election held on September 20, 2005, shall
23 be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended only for
24 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
25 (c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
26 subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total tangible
27 property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax revenue
28 derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible property
29 located within each such city or county. The ad valorem property tax levy
30 of any county or city district entity or subdivision shall be included within
31 this term if the levy of any such district entity or subdivision is applicable
32 to all tangible property located within each such city or county.
33 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
34 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for the
35 purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be included
36 within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such city regardless
37 of its applicability to all tangible property located within each such city. If
38 the tax is levied by a district which extends across city boundaries, for
39 purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy shall be apportioned
40 among each city in which such district extends in the proportion that such
41 tax levied within each city bears to the total tax levied by the district.

1 (7), (8), (9), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (23), (25),
2 (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and, (38) and
3 (39), and amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by
4 the county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue
5 received from the tax was pledged.

7 amendments thereto, all revenues received from a countywide retailers'
8 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
9 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and

13 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, shall

16 unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax authorized
17 by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes the
18 apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
19 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall be
20 paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general fund
21 of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or more
22 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
23 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
24 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
25 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
26 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
27 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
28 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
29 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
30 each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county from the
31 state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.

33 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such information
34 deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion and remit
35 revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
36 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment of
37 countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues received
38 pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or collected
39 under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such revenue
40 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall be
41 deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
42 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.

32 Any county or city levying a retailers' sales tax is hereby prohibited
33 from administering or collecting such tax locally, but shall utilize the
34 services of the state department of revenue to administer, enforce and
35 collect such tax. Except as otherwise specifically provided in K.S.A. 12-
36 189a, and amendments thereto, such tax shall be identical in its
37 application, and exemptions therefrom, to the Kansas retailers' sales tax act
38 and all laws and administrative rules and regulations of the state
39 department of revenue relating to the Kansas retailers' sales tax shall apply
40 to such local sales tax insofar as such laws and rules and regulations may
41 be made applicable. The state director of taxation is hereby authorized to
42 administer, enforce and collect such local sales taxes and to adopt such
43 rules and regulations as may be necessary for the efficient and effective

HB 2125 18
1 administration and enforcement thereof.
2 Upon receipt of a certified copy of an ordinance or resolution
3 authorizing the levy of a local retailers' sales tax, the director of taxation
4 shall cause such taxes to be collected within or without the boundaries of
5 such taxing subdivision at the same time and in the same manner provided
6 for the collection of the state retailers' sales tax. Such copy shall be
7 submitted to the director of taxation within 30 days after adoption of any
8 such ordinance or resolution. The director of taxation shall confirm that all
9 provisions of law applicable to the authorization of local sales tax have
10 been followed prior to causing the collection. If the director of taxation
11 discovers that a city or county did not comply with any provision of law
12 applicable to the authorization of a local sales tax after collection has
13 commenced, the director shall immediately notify the city or county and
14 cease collection of such sales tax until such noncompliance is remedied.
15 All moneys collected by the director of taxation under the provisions of
16 this section shall be credited to a county and city retailers' sales tax fund
17 which fund is hereby established in the state treasury, except that all
18 moneys collected by the director of taxation pursuant to the authority
19 granted in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(22), and amendments thereto, shall be
20 credited to the Wilson county capital improvements fund. Any refund due
21 on any county or city retailers' sales tax collected pursuant to this act shall
22 be paid out of the sales tax refund fund and reimbursed by the director of
23 taxation from collections of local retailers' sales tax revenue. Except for
24 local retailers' sales tax revenue required to be deposited in the
25 redevelopment bond fund established under K.S.A. 74-8927, and
26 amendments thereto, all local retailers' sales tax revenue collected within
27 any county or city pursuant to this act shall be apportioned and remitted at
28 least quarterly by the state treasurer, on instruction from the director of
29 taxation, to the treasurer of such county or city.
30 Revenue that is received from the imposition of a local retailers' sales
31 tax that exceeds the amount of revenue required to pay the costs of a
32 special project for which such revenue was pledged shall be credited to the
33 city or county general fund, as the case requires.
34 The director of taxation shall provide, upon request by a city or county
35 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of any city or county levying a local
36 retailers' sales tax, monthly reports identifying each retailer doing business
37 in such city or county or making taxable sales sourced to such city or
38 county, setting forth the tax liability and the amount of such tax remitted
39 by each retailer during the preceding month and identifying each business
40 location maintained by the retailer and such retailer's sales or use tax
41 registration or account number. Such report shall be made available to the
42 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of such city or county within a
43 reasonable time after it has been requested from the director of taxation.

HB 2125 19
1 The director of taxation shall be allowed to assess a reasonable fee for the
2 issuance of such report. Information received by any city or county
3 pursuant to this section shall be confidential, and it shall be unlawful for
4 any officer or employee of such city or county to divulge any such
5 information in any manner. Any violation of this paragraph by a city or
6 county officer or employee is a class A misdemeanor, and such officer or
7 employee shall be dismissed from office. Reports of violations of this
8 paragraph shall be investigated by the attorney general. The district
9 attorney or county attorney and the attorney general shall have authority to
10 prosecute violations of this paragraph.
11 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-192 is hereby amended to read as
12 follows: 12-192. (a) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (b), (d) or
13 (h), all revenue received by the director of taxation from a countywide
14 retailers' sales tax shall be apportioned among the county and each city
15 located in such county in the following manner:
16 (1) 1/ of all revenue received by the director of taxation shall be
2
17 apportioned among the county and each city located in such county in the
18 proportion that the total tangible property tax levies made in such county
19 in the preceding year for all funds of each such governmental unit bear to
20 the total of all such levies made in the preceding year; and
21 (2) 1/ of all revenue received by the director of taxation from such
2
22 countywide retailers' sales tax shall be apportioned among the county and
23 each city located in such county, first to the county that portion of the
24 revenue equal to the proportion that the population of the county residing
25 in the unincorporated area of the county bears to the total population of the
26 county, and second to the cities in the proportion that the population of
27 each city bears to the total population of the county, except that no persons
28 residing within the Fort Riley military reservation shall be included in the
29 determination of the population of any city located within Riley county.
30 All revenue apportioned to a county shall be paid to its county treasurer
31 and shall be credited to the general fund of the county.
32 (b) (1) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection
33 (a), all revenue received by the director of taxation from a countywide
34 retailers' sales tax imposed within Johnson county at the rate of 0.75%, 1%
35 or 1.25% after July 1, 2007, shall be apportioned among the county and
36 each city located in such county in the following manner:
37 (A) The revenue received from the first 0.5% rate of tax shall be
38 apportioned in the manner prescribed by subsection (a); and
39 (B) the revenue received from the rate of tax exceeding 0.5% shall be
40 apportioned as follows:
41 (i) 1/ shall be apportioned among the county and each city located in
4
42 such county in the proportion that the total tangible property tax levies
43 made in such county in the preceding year for all funds of each such

HB 2125 20
1 governmental unit bear to the total of all such levies made in the preceding
2 year;
3 (ii) 1/ shall be apportioned among the county and each city located in
4
4 such county, first to the county that portion of the revenue equal to the
5 proportion that the population of the county residing in the unincorporated
6 area of the county bears to the total population of the county, and second to
7 the cities in the proportion that the population of each city bears to the
8 total population of the county; and
9 (iii) 1/ shall be retained by the county for its sole use and benefit.
2
10 (2) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),
11 all money received by the director of taxation from a countywide sales tax
12 imposed within Montgomery county pursuant to the election held on
13 November 8, 1994, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county
14 and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from
15 the tax was pledged. All revenue apportioned and paid from the imposition
16 of such tax to the treasurer of any city prior to the effective date of this act
17 shall be remitted to the county treasurer and expended only for the purpose
18 for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
19 (3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),
20 on and after the effective date of this act, all moneys received by the
21 director of taxation from a countywide retailers' sales tax imposed within
22 Phillips county pursuant to the election held on September 20, 2005, shall
23 be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended only for
24 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
25 (c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
26 subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total tangible
27 property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax revenue
28 derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible property
29 located within each such city or county. The ad valorem property tax levy
30 of any county or city district entity or subdivision shall be included within
31 this term if the levy of any such district entity or subdivision is applicable
32 to all tangible property located within each such city or county.
33 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
34 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for the
35 purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be included
36 within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such city regardless
37 of its applicability to all tangible property located within each such city. If
38 the tax is levied by a district which extends across city boundaries, for
39 purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy shall be apportioned
40 among each city in which such district extends in the proportion that such
41 tax levied within each city bears to the total tax levied by the district.
42 (d) (1) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
43 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I), (6),

HB 2125 21
1 (7), (8), (9), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (23), (25),
2 (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and, (38) and
3 (39), and amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by
4 the county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue
5 received from the tax was pledged.
6 (2) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and
7 amendments thereto, all revenues received from a countywide retailers'
8 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
9 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
10 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax
11 was pledged.
12 (3) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
13 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, shall
14 be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended only for
15 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged
16 unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax authorized
17 by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes the
18 apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
19 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall be
20 paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general fund
21 of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or more
22 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
23 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
24 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
25 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
26 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
27 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
28 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
29 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
30 each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county from the
31 state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.
32 (g) Prior to December 31 of each year, the clerk of every county
33 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such information
34 deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion and remit
35 revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
36 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment of
37 countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues received
38 pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or collected
39 under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such revenue
40 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall be
41 deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
42 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.
43 74-8927, and amendments thereto.

HB 2125 22
1 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-187, 12-189 and 12-192 are hereby
2 repealed.
3 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
4 publication in the statute book.
