25 When any statement is returned to the county treasurer for failure to find
26 the addressee, the treasurer shall make a diligent effort to find a
27 forwarding address of the taxpayer and mail the statement to the new
28 address. All tax statements mailed pursuant to this section shall be mailed
29 by first-class mail. The requirement for mailing a tax statement shall
30 extend only to the initial statement required to be mailed in each year and

10 taxpayer. When a tax information form is returned to the county treasurer
11 for failure to find the addressee, the treasurer shall make a diligent effort to
12 find a forwarding address of the taxpayer and mail the tax information
13 form to the new address. All tax information forms mailed pursuant to this

23 containing the budget summary shall be presented to the county clerk
24 within the time prescribed by K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments thereto.
25 All such budget information shall be filed electronically with the county

27 amount of tax to be levied authorized by law, a statement showing the
28 increased amount or tax levy rate voted, or a copy of the charter resolution
29 or ordinance making the change, shall be attached to the budget each year
30 the change is in effect. If any taxing subdivision does not present or file
31 such budget information with the county clerk by 5:00 p.m. on October 1,
32 then the county clerk shall use the previous year's budget information and
33 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied of such taxing subdivision.
34 (b) The county clerk shall make any reductions to the ad valorem tax
35 to be levied, compute the tax levy rates based on the final equalized
36 assessed valuation, and enter such on the budget certificate before attesting
37 the budget, except that with regard to levies made under K.S.A. 75-2551,
38 and amendments thereto, such levies shall be based upon the certified
39 preliminary abstract of property values submitted to the director of
40 property valuation pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1604, and amendments thereto.
41 Beginning in 2022, On or before December 31 each year, a copy of all

3 (c) Each fund of the adopted budget certified to the county clerk in no
4 event shall exceed the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied and the
5 proposed expenditures of such fund in the proposed budget as originally
6 published. The governing body of each taxing subdivision shall not certify
7 an amount of ad valorem taxes to be levied that is in excess of any tax levy
8 rate or amount limitations or any aggregate tax levy limitations. The
9 governing bodies, in fixing the amount may take into consideration and
10 make allowance for the taxes which may not be paid, except that such
11 allowance, however, shall not exceed by more than 5% the percentage of
12 delinquency for the preceding tax year.
13 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2988 is hereby amended to read as
14 follows: 79-2988. (a) On or before June 15 each year, the county clerk
15 shall calculate the revenue neutral rate for each taxing subdivision and
16 include such revenue neutral rate on the notice of the estimated assessed
17 valuation provided to each taxing subdivision for budget purposes, except
18 that for tax year 2024, the deadline shall be extended to July 1, 2024. The
19 director of accounts and reports shall modify the prescribed budget
20 information form to show the revenue neutral rate.
21 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no tax rate in excess
22 of the revenue neutral rate shall be levied by the governing body of any
23 taxing subdivision unless a resolution or ordinance has been approved by
24 the governing body according to the following procedure:
25 (1) At least 10 days in advance of the public hearing, the governing
26 body shall publish notice of its proposed intent to exceed the revenue
27 neutral rate by publishing notice:
28 (A) On the website of the governing body, if the governing body

33 of the public hearing.
34 (2) On or before July 20, the governing body shall notify the county
35 clerk of its proposed intent to exceed the revenue neutral rate and provide
36 the date, time and location of the public hearing and its proposed tax rate.
37 For all tax years commencing after December 31, 2021, the county clerk
38 shall notify each taxpayer with property in the taxing subdivision, by mail
39 directed to the taxpayer's last known address, of the proposed intent to
40 exceed the revenue neutral rate at least 10 days in advance of the public
41 hearing. Alternatively, the county clerk may transmit the notice to the
42 taxpayer by electronic means at least 10 days in advance of the public
43 hearing, if such taxpayer and county clerk have consented in writing to

S Sub HB 2125 5
1 service by electronic means. The county clerk is not required to send a
2 notice to a property owner of property that is exempt from ad valorem
3 taxation. The county clerk shall consolidate the required information for
4 all taxing subdivisions relevant to the taxpayer's property on one notice.
5 The notice shall be in a format prescribed by the director of accounts and
6 reports. The notice shall include, but not be limited to:

23 to prohibit additional public hearings that provide additional opportunities

4 (2) Any taxpayer of the taxing subdivision that is the subject of the
5 complaint or such taxpayer's duly authorized representative may file a
6 complaint with the state board of tax appeals by filing a written complaint,
7 on a form prescribed by the board, that contains the facts that the
8 complaining party believes show that a governing body of a taxing
9 subdivision did not comply with the provisions of subsection (b) and that a
10 reduction or refund of taxes is appropriate. The complaining party shall
11 provide a copy of such complaint to the governing body of the taxing
12 subdivision making the levy that is the subject of the complaint.
13 Notwithstanding K.S.A. 74-2438a, and amendments thereto, no filing fee
14 shall be charged by the executive director of the state board of tax appeals
15 for a complaint filed pursuant to this paragraph. The governing body of the
16 taxing subdivision making the levy that is the subject of the complaint
17 shall be a party to the proceeding. Notice of any summary proceeding or
18 hearing shall be served upon such governing body, the county clerk, the
19 director of accounts and reports and the complaining party. It shall be the
20 duty of the governing body to initiate the production of evidence to

24 did not comply with subsection (b), the state board of tax appeals shall
25 order such governing body to refund to taxpayers the amount of property
26 taxes over collected or reduce the taxes levied, if uncollected. The
27 provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed as prohibiting any other
28 remedies available under the law.
29 (d) On and after January 1, 2022, in the event that the tax levied by a
30 school district pursuant to K.S.A. 72-5142, and amendments thereto,
31 increases the property tax revenue generated for the purpose of calculating
32 the revenue neutral rate from the previous tax year and such amount of
33 increase in revenue generated from such tax levied is the only reason that
34 the school district would exceed the total property tax revenue from the
35 prior year, the school district shall be deemed to not have exceeded the
36 revenue neutral rate in levying a tax rate in excess of the revenue neutral
37 rate to take into account the increase in revenue from only such tax levied.
38 (e) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if
39 the governing body of a taxing subdivision must conduct a public hearing
40 to approve exceeding the revenue neutral rate under this section, the
41 governing body of the taxing subdivision shall certify, on or before
42 October 1, to the proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be
43 levied.

S Sub HB 2125 8
1 (2) If a governing body of a taxing subdivision did not comply with
2 the provisions of subsection (b) and certifies to the county clerk an amount
3 of ad valorem tax to be levied that would result in a tax rate in excess of its
4 revenue neutral rate, the county clerk shall reduce the ad valorem tax to be
5 levied to the amount resulting from such taxing subdivision's revenue
6 neutral rate.
7 (f) As used in this section:
8 (1) "Taxing subdivision" means any political subdivision of the state
9 that levies an ad valorem tax on property.
10 (2) "Revenue neutral rate" means the tax rate for the current tax year
11 that would generate the same property tax revenue as levied the previous
12 tax year using the current tax year's total assessed valuation. To calculate
13 the revenue neutral rate, the county clerk shall divide the property tax
14 revenue for such taxing subdivision levied for the previous tax year by the
15 total of all taxable assessed valuation in such taxing subdivision for the
16 current tax year, and then multiply the quotient by 1,000 to express the rate
17 in mills. The revenue neutral rate shall be expressed to the third decimal
18 place.
19 (g) In the event that a county clerk incurred costs of printing and
20 postage that were not reimbursed pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2989,
21 and amendments thereto, such county clerk may seek reimbursement from
22 all taxing subdivisions required to send the notice. Such costs shall be
23 shared proportionately by all taxing subdivisions that were included on the
24 same notice based on the total property tax levied by each taxing
25 subdivision. Payment of such costs shall be due to the county clerk by
26 December 31.
27 (h) The department of administration or the director of accounts and
28 reports shall make copies of adopted budgets, budget certificates, other
29 budget documents and revenue neutral rate documents available to the
30 public on the department of administration's website on a permanently
31 accessible web page that may be accessed via a conspicuous link to that
32 web page placed on the front page of the department's website. The
33 department of administration or the director of accounts and reports shall
34 also make the following information for each tax year available on such
35 website:
36 (1) A list of taxing subdivisions by county;
37 (2) whether each taxing subdivision conducted a hearing to consider
38 exceeding its revenue neutral rate;
39 (3) the revenue neutral rate of each taxing subdivision;
40 (4) the tax rate resulting from the adopted budget of each taxing
41 subdivision; and
42 (5) the percent change between the revenue neutral rate and the tax
43 rate for each taxing subdivision.

S Sub HB 2125 9
1 (i) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, in the event any
2 governing body does not comply with the provisions of subsection (b)
3 because such governing body did not intend to exceed its revenue neutral
4 rate but the final taxable assessed valuation of such taxing subdivision
5 used to calculate the actual tax levy is less than the estimated assessed
6 valuation used to calculate the revenue neutral rate, such governing body
7 shall be permitted to levy a tax rate that generates the same amount of
8 property tax revenue as levied the previous year or less.
9 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2989 is hereby amended to read as
10 follows: 79-2989. (a) For calendar years 2023 and 2024, 2025 and 2026 if
11 a county clerk has printing or postage costs pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp.
12 79-2988, and amendments thereto, the county clerk shall notify and
13 provide documentation of such costs to the secretary of revenue. The
14 secretary of revenue shall certify the amount of moneys attributable to
15 such costs and shall transmit a copy of such certification to the director of
16 accounts and reports. Upon such receipt of such certification, the director
17 of accounts and reports shall transfer an amount of moneys equal to such
18 certified amount from the state general fund to the taxpayer notification
19 costs fund of the department of revenue. The secretary of revenue shall
20 transmit a copy of each such certification to the director of legislative
21 research and the director of the budget.
22 (b) There is hereby established in the state treasury the taxpayer
23 notification costs fund that shall be administered by the secretary of
24 revenue. All expenditures from the taxpayer notification costs fund shall
25 be for the purpose of paying county printing and postage costs pursuant to
26 K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2988, and amendments thereto. All expenditures
27 from such fund shall be made in accordance with appropriations acts upon
28 warrants of the director of accounts and reports issued pursuant to
29 vouchers approved by the secretary of revenue or the secretary's designee.
30 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-1801, 79-2001, 79-2930, 79-2988 and
31 79-2989 are hereby repealed.

33 publication in the statute book.
