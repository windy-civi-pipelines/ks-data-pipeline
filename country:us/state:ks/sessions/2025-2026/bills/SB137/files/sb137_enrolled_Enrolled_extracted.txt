law enforcement agency may:
(1) Retain such property for official use or transfer the custody or
ownership to any local or state agency, subject to any lien preserved by
the court;
(2) transfer the custody or ownership to any federal agency if
authorized pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4107, and amendments thereto;
(3) destroy or use for investigative or training purposes, any illegal

that materials necessary as evidence shall be preserved;
(4) sell property which is not required by law to be destroyed and
which is not harmful to the public:
(A) All property, except real property, designated by the seizing
agency to be sold shall be sold at public sale to the highest bidder for
cash without appraisal. The seizing agency shall first cause notice of
the sale to be made by publication at least once in an official county
newspaper as defined by K.S.A. 64-101, and amendments thereto. Such
notice shall include the time, place, and conditions of the sale and
description of the property to be sold. Nothing in this subsection shall
prevent a state agency from using the state surplus property system and
such system's procedures shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of
this subsection.
(B) Real property may be sold pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(A), or
the seizing agency may contract with a real estate company, licensed in
this state, to list, advertise and sell such real property in a commercially
reasonable manner.

discretion of the seizing agency, shall be destroyed, used within the
seizing agency for official purposes, traded to another law enforcement
agency for use within such agency, sold or transferred to a properly
licensed federal firearms dealer or given to the Kansas bureau of
investigation for law enforcement, testing, comparison or destruction
by the Kansas bureau of investigation forensic laboratory.
(c) The proceeds of any sale shall be distributed in the following
order of priority:

used for such additional law enforcement and prosecutorial purposes as
the county or district attorney or other governmental agency's attorney
deems appropriate, including educational purposes. All moneys derived

this act. Neither future forfeitures nor the proceeds therefrom shall be
used in planning or adopting a county or district attorney's budget;
(B) if the plaintiff's attorney is the attorney general and the
conduct and offense giving rise to forfeiture is pursuant to K.S.A. 60-
4104(i), and amendments thereto, fees shall not exceed 15% of the total
proceeds, less the amounts of subsection (c)(1) and (2) in an
uncontested forfeiture nor 20% of the total proceeds, less the amounts
of subsection (c)(1) and (2) in a contested forfeiture. Such fees shall be
remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of
K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such
remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the
state treasury to the credit of the medicaid fraud prosecution revolving
fund. Moneys paid into the medicaid fraud prosecution revolving fund
pursuant to this subsection shall be appropriated to the attorney general
for use by the attorney general in the investigation and prosecution of
medicaid fraud and abuse; or
(C) if the plaintiff's attorney is a private attorney, such reasonable
fees shall be negotiated by the employing law enforcement agency;
(4) repayment of law enforcement funds expended in purchasing
of contraband or controlled substances, subject to any interagency
agreement.
