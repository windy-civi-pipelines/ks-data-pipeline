24 ensure that safe and reliable school psychological services are available in
25 each member state;
26 (c) enhances the public accessibility of school psychological services
27 by increasing the availability of qualified, licensed school psychologists
28 through the establishment of an efficient and streamlined pathway for
29 licensees to practice in other member states;
30 (d) preserves and respects the authority of each member state to
31 protect the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that only
32 qualified, licensed professionals are authorized to provide school
33 psychological services within that state;
34 (e) requires school psychologists practicing within a member state to
35 comply with the scope of practice laws present in the state where the

HB 2069 2
1 school psychological services are being provided;
2 (f) promotes cooperation between the member states in regulating the

36 the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such
37 rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.
38 (d) Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted or ratified at a
39 regular or special meeting of the commission in accordance with
40 commission rules and bylaws.
41 (e) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the
42 commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting when the rule
43 will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of

HB 2069 13
1 proposed rulemaking:
2 (1) On the website of the commission or other publicly accessible
3 platform; and
4 (2) on the website of each member state licensing authority or other
5 publicly accessible platform or the publication where each state would
6 otherwise publish proposed rules.
7 (f) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission
8 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 48 hours' notice, with
9 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
10 shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in
11 no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the
12 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted
13 immediately in order to:
14 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare.
15 (A) Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
16 (B) meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule
17 that is established by federal law or rule; or
18 (C) protect public health and safety.
19 SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
20 ENFORCMENT
21 (a) Oversight.
22 (1) The executive and judicial branches of the state government in
23 each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions
24 necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
25 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
26 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
27 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
28 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
29 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
30 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
31 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
32 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
33 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
34 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
35 and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.
36 Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a
37 judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or promulgated
38 rules.
39 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
40 (1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in
41 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or
42 the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the
43 defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the

HB 2069 14
1 proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the
2 commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
3 assistance regarding the default.
4 (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to
5 the other member states.
6 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
7 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
8 supermajority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights,
9 privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be
10 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
11 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
12 the period of default.
13 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
14 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
15 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
16 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
17 legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority and each of the
18 member states' licensing authorities.
19 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
20 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
21 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
22 termination.
23 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact,
24 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
25 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
26 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months
27 after the date of said notice of termination.
28 (g) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
29 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless
30 agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
31 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by
32 petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or
33 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
34 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
35 reasonable attorney fees.
36 (i) Dispute resolution.
37 (1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to
38 resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
39 between member and nonmember states.
40 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
41 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
42 (j) Enforcement.
43 (1) By majority vote as provided by rule, the commission may initiate

HB 2069 15
1 legal action against a member state in default in the United States district
2 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
3 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
4 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may
5 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
6 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
7 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein
8 shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission
9 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting
10 member state's law.
11 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission
12 in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
13 federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
14 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.
15 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
16 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
17 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
18 (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact
19 against the commission.
20 SECTION 11—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
21 AMENDMENT
22 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
23 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
24 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact indicated above, the
25 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the charter
26 member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter
27 member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
28 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
29 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the
30 default process set forth in section 10.
31 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
32 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in
33 existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
34 member states should be less than seven.
35 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
36 member states shall be subject to the process set forth in section 7(c)(21)
37 to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model
38 compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
39 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
40 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
41 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence
42 shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
43 repudiated by the commission.

HB 2069 16
1 (A) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's
2 initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and
3 bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes law in that state.
4 Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have
5 the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that
6 state.
7 (B) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
8 statute repealing the same.
9 (b) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
10 after enactment of the repealing statute.
11 (c) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
12 withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
13 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
14 effective date of withdrawal.
15 (d) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
16 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
17 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
18 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
19 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months
20 after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
21 (1) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
22 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
23 between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with
24 the provisions of this compact.
25 (2) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
26 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
27 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
28 SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
29 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be
30 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, implementation and
31 administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
32 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to
33 limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
34 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
35 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
36 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
37 state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States,
38 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
39 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
40 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
41 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
42 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
43 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the commission may deny a

HB 2069 17
1 state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements
2 of section 10(b), terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if
3 it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a
4 material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be
5 held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
6 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
7 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
8 matters.
9 SECTION 13—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
10 OTHER STATE LAWS
11 (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any
12 other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.
13 (b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
14 member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of
15 the conflict.
16 (c) All permissible agreements between the commission and the
17 member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
18 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
19 publication in the statute book.
