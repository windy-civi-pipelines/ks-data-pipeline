SECTION 1—PURPOSE
The purpose of this compact is to facilitate the interstate practice of

(c) enhances the public accessibility of school psychological
services by increasing the availability of qualified, licensed school
psychologists through the establishment of an efficient and streamlined
pathway for licensees to practice in other member states;
(d) preserves and respects the authority of each member state to
protect the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that only
qualified, licensed professionals are authorized to provide school
psychological services within that state;
(e) requires school psychologists practicing within a member state
to comply with the scope of practice laws present in the state where the
school psychological services are being provided;
(f) promotes cooperation between the member states in regulating
the practice of school psychology within those states; and

only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the

action against a licensee's home state license.

state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to
determine appropriate action.

state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse
action against a licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's
compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the
pendency of the order.
(i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an
unencumbered license as certified by the home state's licensing
authority, the licensee shall meet the requirements of section 4(a) and
follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact
privilege in any remote state.

promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator

defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall

may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a

and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated
on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not
relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
the period of default.
(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the

with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact
commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies
available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
(2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its

statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially
different than the model compact statute.

materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
the default process set forth in section 11.

terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission
shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if
the number of member states should be fewer than seven.
(2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 27
(4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to

compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of
withdrawal.

invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does
not conflict with the provisions of this compact.

authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes

member states and in full force and effect as to the member state
affected as to all severable matters.

(d) Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements
established by a member state for the issuance of a single-state license.
(e) A multistate license issued to a licensee by a home state to a
resident of that state shall be recognized by each member state as
authorizing a licensee to practice cosmetology in each member state.
(f) At no point shall the commission have the power to define the
educational or professional requirements for a license to practice
cosmetology. The member states shall retain sole jurisdiction over the
provision of these requirements.
ARTICLE 4—MULTISTATE LICENSE
(a) To be eligible to apply to their home state's state licensing
authority for an initial multistate license under this compact, a licensee
must hold an active and unencumbered single-state license to practice
cosmetology in such licensee's home state.

according to the rules of the commission, a member state's state
licensing authority shall ascertain whether the applicant meets the
requirements for a multistate license under this compact.
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 31
(c) If an applicant meets the requirements for a multistate license
under this compact and any applicable rules of the commission, the

reasonable time, grant a multistate license to that applicant and inform
all member states of the grant of such multistate license.
(d) A multistate license to practice cosmetology issued by a
member state's state licensing authority shall be recognized by each
member state as authorizing the practice thereof as though that licensee
held a single-state license to do so in each member state, subject to the
restrictions herein.

effective for a definite period of time, concurrent with the licensure
renewal period in the home state.

the state scope of practice laws governing the practice of cosmetology
of any member state where the licensee provides services;

of practice laws governing cosmetology services in that state.

pursuant to this compact shall subject the licensee to the jurisdiction of
the state licensing authority, the courts and the laws of the member state
where the cosmetology services are provided.
ARTICLE 5—REISSUANCE OF A MULTISTATE LICENSE
BY A NEW HOME STATE
(a) A licensee may hold a multistate license, issued by their home
state, in only one member state at any given time.

between two member states:
(1) The licensee shall immediately apply for the reissuance of
such multistate license in such licensee's new home state. The licensee

accordance with the rules of the commission;
(2) upon receipt of an application to reissue a multistate license,
the new home state shall verify that the multistate license is active,

compact and the rules of the commission. The multistate license issued
by the prior home state shall be deactivated and all member states
notified in accordance with the applicable rules adopted by the
commission;
(3) if required for initial licensure, the new home state may require
a background check as specified in the laws of that state, or the
compliance with any jurisprudence requirements of the new home state;
and

licensee does not meet the requirements set forth in this compact for the
reissuance of a multistate license by the new home state, then such
licensee shall be subject to the new home state requirements for the
issuance of a single-state license in that state.
(c) If a licensee changes such licensee's primary state of residence
by moving from a member state to a non-member state, or from a non-
member state to a member state, then the licensee shall be subject to the
state requirements for the issuance of a single-state license in the new
home state.

purposes of this compact, a licensee shall have only one home state and
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 32
one multistate license.
(e) Nothing in this compact shall interfere with the requirements
established by a member state for the issuance of a single-state license.
ARTICLE 6—AUTHORITY OF THE COMPACT COMMISSION
AND MEMBER STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES
(a) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the
commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict or in any way reduce
the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, rules or
regulations related to the practice of cosmetology in that state where
those laws, rules or regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions
of this compact.
(b) Insofar as practicable, a member state's state licensing
authority shall cooperate with the commission and with each entity
exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of
cosmetology according to the provisions of this compact.
(c) Discipline shall be the sole responsibility of the state where
cosmetology services are provided. Accordingly, each member state's
state licensing authority shall be responsible for receiving complaints
about individuals practicing cosmetology in that state and for
communicating all relevant investigative information about any such
adverse action to the other member states through the data system in
addition to any other methods the commission may require by rule.
ARTICLE 7—ADVERSE ACTIONS
(a) A licensee's home state shall have exclusive power to impose
an adverse action against a licensee's multistate license issued by the
home state.
(b) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license
based on the investigative information, current significant investigative
information or adverse action of a remote state.
(c) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote
state's state licensing authority shall have the power to:
(1) Take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to
practice cosmetology through the multistate license in that member
state, except that:
(A) Only the licensee's home state shall have the power to take
adverse action against the multistate license issued by the home state;
and
(B) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's
state licensing authority shall give the same priority and effect to
reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such
conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state
shall apply its own state laws to determine the appropriate action;
(2) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a
licensee's authorization to practice within that member state;
(3) complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes
their primary state of residence during the course of such an
investigation. The state licensing authority shall also be empowered to
report the results of such an investigation to the commission through
the data system as described herein;
(4) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that
require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the
production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority
in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in
the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in
proceedings before it. The issuing state licensing authority shall pay
any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by
the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are
located;
(5) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 33
licensee the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting
from any adverse action taken against that licensee; and
(6) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to
practice in that state based on the factual findings of another remote
state.
(d) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending
investigation of a cosmetologist who changes such licensee's primary
state of residence during the course of the investigation. The home state
shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and promptly
report the conclusions of the investigations to the data system.
(e) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a
licensee's multistate license, the licensee's authorization to practice in
all other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances
have been removed from the home state license. All home state
disciplinary orders that impose an adverse action against a licensee's
multistate license shall include a statement that the cosmetologist's
authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states during the
pendency of the order.
(f) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's
authority to accept a licensee's participation in an alternative program
in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license shall be
suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any
alternative program.
(g) Joint investigations.
(1) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its
respective scope of practice laws or other applicable state law, a
member state may participate with other member states in joint
investigations of licensees.
(2) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation or
compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual
investigation initiated under the compact.
ARTICLE 8—ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR
SPOUSES

state where the individual has a current license to practice cosmetology
in good standing. The individual may retain their home state
designation during any period of service when that individual or their
spouse is on active duty assignment.
ARTICLE 9—ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF
THE COSMETOLOGY LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
(a) The compact member states create and establish a joint
government agency whose membership consists of all member states
that have enacted the compact, which shall be known as the
cosmetology licensure compact commission. The commission is an
instrumentality of the compact member states acting jointly and not an
instrumentality of any one state. The commission shall come into
existence on or after the effective date of the compact as set forth in
article 13.
(b) Membership, voting and meetings.
(1) Each member state shall have and be limited to one delegate

for the grant of a multistate license and thereafter, as may be
established by commission rule, charge the licensee a multistate license
renewal fee for each renewal period. Nothing herein shall be construed
to prevent a home state from charging a licensee a fee for a multistate
license or renewals of a multistate license or a fee for the jurisprudence
requirement if the member state imposes such a requirement for the
grant of a multistate license;
(13) assess and collect fees;
(14) accept any and all appropriate gifts, donations, grants of

otherwise abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state
action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the
Sherman antitrust act of 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 17-27 or
any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.

and the existence of investigative information pertaining to a licensee
in any member state shall only be available to other member states.

effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or

manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, the
powers granted under this compact or based upon another applicable
standard of review.
(b) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
member state, except that where the rules of the commission conflict

be ineffective in such state to the extent of the conflict.
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 39

effect in any member state or to any state applying to participate in the
compact.
(e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
commission.
(f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold
a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written

written comments and documents received by the commission in
response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.

final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and
the full text of the rule.
(1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
(2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons
for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
commenters.
(3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in article 11(l), the
effective date of the rule shall not be earlier than 45 days after the
commission issues notice that it has adopted or amended such rule.
(l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission
may consider and adopt an emergency rule with five days' notice, with

further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take
effect without the approval of the commission.

necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
resolution proceedings. Nothing in this compact shall affect or limit the
selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
(3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process
in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for
all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall
render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact or

(1) If the commission determines that a member state has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
this compact or adopted rules, the commission shall provide written

the commission may take and offer training and specific technical
assistance regarding the default.

may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated
on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not
relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
the period of default.
(4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the

assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
effective date of termination.
(6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this
compact, such state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees
who hold a multistate license within that state of such termination. The
terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted
pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
said notice of termination.
(7) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that
is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact
unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
defaulting state.

offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(c) Dispute resolution.
(1) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt
to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member
states and between member and non-member states.

commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default
in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
federal district where the commission has its principal offices to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its adopted
rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorney fees. The remedies in this compact shall not be the exclusive
remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other
remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
(3) A member state may initiate legal action against the
commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and
its adopted rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the

this compact against the commission.

compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. On or
after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene
and review the enactment of each of the charter member states to
determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is
materially different than the model compact statute.
(1) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
the default process set forth in article 12.
(2) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall
remain in existence, and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 42
number of member states should be fewer than seven.
(3) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
member states shall be subject to the process set forth in article 9(c)(24)
to determine if such enactments are materially different from the model
compact statute and whether the enactments qualify for participation in
the compact.

furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior
to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless
specifically repudiated by the commission.

commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the
compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously
adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law
on the date that the compact becomes law in that state.

enacting a statute repealing that state's enactment of the compact.

prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
(3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to
all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent
statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
(c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does
not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon
any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
ARTICLE 14—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall
be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall
not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely
for those purposes.
(b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact
and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person
or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
(c) Notwithstanding article 14(b), the commission may deny a
state's participation in the compact or terminate a member state's
participation in the compact, in accordance with the requirements of
article 12, if the commission determines that a constitutional
requirement of a member state is a material departure from the
compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the
constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force
and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect
as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.

member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent
of the conflict.

Sec. 4.

Section 33:
SECTION 1—PURPOSE
In order to strengthen access to medical services and in recognition
of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating
states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing
authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and
seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while
safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows medical
services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the
licensee's qualifying license by other compact-participating states. This
compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and
affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA
occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter
and, therefore, requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the state
licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that
participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse
action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a PA through
the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate
burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel
and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an
unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

Section 34:

restriction on the licensee's practice.

that issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect
to reported conduct received from any other participating state as it
would if the conduct had occurred within the participating state that
issued the qualifying license. The participating state shall apply its own
state laws to determine appropriate action.
(f) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may
recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition
of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.
(g) A participating state may take adverse action based on the
factual findings of a remote state if the participating state follows its
own procedures for taking the adverse action.

(2) The executive committee shall be composed of nine members
described as follows:
(A) Seven voting members who are elected by the commission
from the current membership of the commission;
(B) (i) (a) one ex officio, nonvoting member from a recognized
national PA professional association; and
(b) one ex officio, nonvoting member from a recognized national
PA certification organization.
(ii) The ex officio members shall be selected by their respective
organizations.
(3) The commission may remove any member of the executive
committee as provided in its bylaws.
(4) The executive committee shall meet at least annually.
(5) The executive committee shall have the following duties and
responsibilities:
(A) Recommend to the commission changes to the commission's
rules or bylaws, changes to this compact legislation, fees to be paid by
compact-participating states such as annual dues and any commission
compact fee charged to licensees for the compact privilege;
(B) ensure that compact administration services are appropriately
provided, whether contractual or otherwise;
(C) prepare and recommend the budget;
(D) maintain financial records on behalf of the commission;
(E) monitor compact compliance of participating states and
provide compliance reports to the commission;
(F) establish additional committees as necessary;

other powers and duties exclusively reserved to the commission by the
commission's rules; and
(H) perform other duties as provided in the commission's rules or
bylaws.
(6) All meetings of the executive committee at which it votes or
plans to vote on matters in exercising the powers and duties of the
commission shall be open to the public and public notice of such
meetings shall be given as public meetings of the commission are
given.
(7) The executive committee may convene in a closed, nonpublic
meeting for the same reasons that the commission may convene in a
nonpublic meeting as set forth in subsection (d)(3), and shall announce
the closed meeting as the commission is required to do under
subsection (d)(4) and keep minutes of the closed meeting as the
commission is required to do under subsection (d)(5).
(g) Qualified immunity, defense and indemnification.
(1) The members, officers, executive director, employees and
representatives of the commission shall be immune from suit and
liability, both personally and in their official capacity, for any claim for
damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability
caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission
that occurred or that the individual against whom the claim is made had
a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
commission employment, duties or responsibilities. Nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed to protect any such individual from suit or
liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the
intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of such individual. The
procurement of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in
any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
(2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive
director, employee, and representative of the commission in any civil
action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged
act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of commission
employment, duties or responsibilities or as determined by the
commission that the individual against whom the claim is made had a
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 51
reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission
employment, duties or responsibilities. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit such individual from retaining such individual's
own counsel at the individual's own expense or that the actual or
alleged act, error or omission did not result from the individual's
intentional, willful or wanton misconduct.
(3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any
member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the
commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained
against that individual arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or
omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment,
duties or responsibilities or that such individual had a reasonable basis
for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment,
duties or responsibilities, if the actual or alleged act, error or omission
did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of
that individual.
(4) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
in any proceedings as authorized by commission rules.
(5) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on
the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct,
which shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
(6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to designate the
venue or jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice,
professional misconduct, negligence or other such civil action
pertaining to the practice of a PA. All such matters shall be determined
exclusively by state law other than this compact.
(7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or
otherwise abrogate a participating state's state action immunity or state
action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the
Sherman act, Clayton act or any other state or federal antitrust or
anticompetitive law or regulation.
(8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
sovereign immunity by the participating states or by the commission.

Section 40:
SECTION 8—DATA SYSTEM
(a) The commission shall provide for the development,
maintenance, operation and utilization of a coordinated data and
reporting system containing licensure, adverse action and the reporting
of the existence of significant investigative information on all licensed
PAs and applicants that are denied a license in participating states.
(b) Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a
participating state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on
all PAs to whom this compact is applicable, utilizing a unique
identifier, as required by the rules of the commission, including:
(1) Identifying information;
(2) licensure data;
(3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege;
(4) any denial of application for licensure and the reason for such
denial, excluding the reporting of any criminal history record
information where such reporting is prohibited by law;
(5) the existence of significant investigative information; and
(6) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
compact, as determined by the rules of the commission.
(c) Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
any participating state shall only be available to other participating
states.
(d) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states
of any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying
for a license that has been reported to such commission. Such adverse
action information shall be available to any other participating state.
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 52
(e) Participating states contributing information to the data system
may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that
shall not be shared with the public without the express permission of
the contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such
information shall be reported to the commission through the data
system.
(f) Any information submitted to the data system that is
subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the
participating state contributing the information shall be removed from
the data system upon reporting of such by the participating state to the
commission.
(g) The records and information provided to a participating state
pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when certified by
the commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated
business records of the commission and shall be entitled to any
associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or
administrative proceedings in a participating state.

Section 41:
SECTION 9—RULEMAKING
(a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant
to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.
Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
commission for each rule.
(b) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and
achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and have no
force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking
authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
compact, the powers granted hereunder or based upon another
applicable standard of review.
(c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
participating state, except that where the rules of the commission
conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the
medical services, a PA may perform in the participating state, as held
by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the rules of the commission
shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
(d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states
rejects a commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
same manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date
of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and
effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in
the compact.
(e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special
meeting of the commission.
(f) Prior to adoption of a final rule by the commission and at least
30 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered
and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed
rulemaking:
(1) On the commission's website or other publicly accessible
platform;
(2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's
notices of proposed rulemaking; and
(3) in such other ways as the commission may specify by rule.
(g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
(1) The time, date and location of the public hearing on the
proposed rule and the proposed time, date and location of the meeting
in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
(2) the text of and the reason for the proposed rule;
(3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any
interested person and the date by which written comments must be
received; and
(4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 53
the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or
provide any written comments.
(h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall
allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments,
which shall be made available to the public.
(i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the
commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic
hearing.
(1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed
in the notice of proposed rulemaking published not less than five
business days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the
commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
(2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner that provides each
person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to
comment orally or in writing.
(3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the
written comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments received in
response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a
person upon request.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
separate hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped
for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this

Section 42:
section.
(j) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all
written and oral comments timely received.
(k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take
final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date
of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text
of the rule.
(1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission's
website.
(2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
changes do not expand the original purpose of the proposed rule.
(3) The commission shall provide an explanation on its website of
the reasons for any substantive changes made to the proposed rule as
well as reasons for any substantive changes not made that were
recommended by commenters.
(4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the
effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after the
commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
(l) Upon the determination that an emergency exists, the
commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
prior notice, without the opportunity for comment or hearing, expect
that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in
this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
reasonably possible but in no event later than 90 days after the effective
date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is
one that shall be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:
(1) Address an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
(2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
(3) meet a deadline for the adoption of a commission rule that is
established by federal law or rule; or
(4) protect public health and safety.
(m) The commission, or an authorized committee of the
commission, may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission
rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
errors in consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
revisions shall be posted on the commission's website. The revision
shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after
posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be
made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the
commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 54
made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If the
revision is challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the
approval of the commission.
(n) No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply
under this compact.

Section 43:
SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION
AND ENFORCEMENT
(a) Oversight.
(1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in
each participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions
necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
to the extent that it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
(3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process
in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene
in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in
such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact or
commission rules.
(b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
(1) If the commission determines that a participating state has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide
written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default and any other action that the commission may take and shall
offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the
default.
(2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a
majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may
be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred
during the period of default.
(3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
defaulting state's legislature and to the licensing board of each of the
participating states.
(4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
effective date of termination.
(5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that
is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact,
unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
defaulting state.
(6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the
compact by the commission by petitioning the United States district
court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(7) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact,
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 55
the state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that
state of such termination:
(A) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that
state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the
effective date of such termination; and
(B) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted
a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact
privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license
in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating
state before the 180-day period ends, in which case, the compact
privilege shall continue.
(c) Dispute resolution.
(1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall
attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among
participating states and between participating and nonparticipating
states.
(2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both
mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
(d) Enforcement.
(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
shall enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the
commission.
(2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure
compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission
may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has
its principal offices against a participating state in default to enforce
compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commission's
adopted rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is
necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
under federal or state law.
(e) Legal action against the commission.
(1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the
commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and
its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney fees.
(2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this
compact against the commission.

Section 44:
SECTION 11—DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
(a) This compact shall come into effect on the date that this
compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
(1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission
shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that
enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, called charter-
participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such
charter-participating state is materially different than the model
compact.
(A) A charter-participating state whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the
default process set forth in section 10(b).
(B) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or
its participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence
and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 56
participating states should be fewer than seven. Participating states
enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be
subject to the process set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their
enactments are materially different from the model compact and
whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the
seven initial charter-participating states shall be subject to the process
set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are
materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify
for participation in the compact.
(3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior
to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless
specifically repudiated by the commission.
(b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the
commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that this
compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously
adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law
on the day that this compact becomes law in that state.
(c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by
enacting a statute repealing the same.
(1) A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
days after enactment of the repealing statute. During the 180-day
period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing
state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state
shall remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state
is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in
another participating state within the 180 days, the licensee's compact
privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the
passage of the 180 days.
(2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
state licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the
investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact
prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
(3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this
compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue
to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
(d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between participating states and between a participating
state and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the
provisions of this compact.
(e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No
amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon
any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner
into the laws of all participating states as determined by the
commission.

Section 45:
SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall
be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall
not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely
for those purposes.
(b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any
phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 57
person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact
and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person
or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or subsection
(b), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or,
in accordance with the requirements of section 10(b), terminate a
participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with
respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material
departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to
be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating
states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as
to all severable matters.

Section 46:
SECTION 13—BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
(b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact
are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
(c) All agreements between the commission and the participating
states are binding in accordance with their terms.
Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
publication in the statute book.

or wanton misconduct.

duties or responsibilities or that such person had a reasonable basis for
believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties
or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error or
omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton
misconduct of that person.
(4) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on
the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct,
that shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.

to the criteria set forth in this interstate compact and the rules adopted
thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date
specified in each rule or amendment.
(b) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to achieve
the intent and purpose of this interstate compact. In the event the
commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is
beyond purpose and intent of this interstate compact, or the powers
granted hereunder, then such an action by the commission shall be
invalid and have no force and effect of law in the member states.
(c) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a

during the period of default.

only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the

or the defaulting member state's law.

commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal

(b) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse
action against a licensee's home state license.
(c) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall
give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a
member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home
state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to
determine appropriate action.
(d) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a
licensee who changes home states during the course of the
investigations. The home state shall also have authority to take
appropriate action and promptly report the conclusions of the

findings of another remote state if the member state follows its own

respective state law, any member state may participate with other
member states in joint investigations of licensees.

state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse
action against a licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's
compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the
pendency of the order.
(i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an
unencumbered license as certified by the home state's licensing
authority, the licensee shall meet the requirements of section 4(a) and
follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact
privilege in any remote state.

promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator

of adverse action.

law in each member state, except that where the rules conflict with the

members, take final action on the proposed rule based on the
rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not
relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
the period of default.
(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the

with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact
commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies
available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
(2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its

commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the
statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially
different than the model compact statute.
(A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
the default process set forth in section 11.
(B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission
shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if
the number of member states should be fewer than seven.
(2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
section 8(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different

in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact

coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 27
(4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes
law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the

enacting a statute repealing such compact.
(1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180

withdrawal.
(c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does
not conflict with the provisions of this compact.

amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon
any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
SECTION 13—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking
authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes
and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions
of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
rules shall not be construed to limit the compact commission's
rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.

phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the

person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact
and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person
or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation
in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a
member state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact
shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the

cosmetology. The member states shall retain sole jurisdiction over the
provision of these requirements.

issuance of a single-state license in that state.
(c) If a licensee changes such licensee's primary state of residence
by moving from a member state to a non-member state, or from a non-

ARTICLE 6—AUTHORITY OF THE COMPACT COMMISSION
AND MEMBER STATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES

commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict or in any way reduce
the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, rules or
regulations related to the practice of cosmetology in that state where
those laws, rules or regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions
of this compact.
(b) Insofar as practicable, a member state's state licensing
authority shall cooperate with the commission and with each entity
exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of
cosmetology according to the provisions of this compact.
(c) Discipline shall be the sole responsibility of the state where
cosmetology services are provided. Accordingly, each member state's

communicating all relevant investigative information about any such
adverse action to the other member states through the data system in
addition to any other methods the commission may require by rule.
ARTICLE 7—ADVERSE ACTIONS
(a) A licensee's home state shall have exclusive power to impose
an adverse action against a licensee's multistate license issued by the
home state.
(b) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license
based on the investigative information, current significant investigative

state's state licensing authority shall have the power to:
(1) Take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to
practice cosmetology through the multistate license in that member
state, except that:
(A) Only the licensee's home state shall have the power to take
adverse action against the multistate license issued by the home state;
and
(B) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's
state licensing authority shall give the same priority and effect to
reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such
conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state
shall apply its own state laws to determine the appropriate action;
(2) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a
licensee's authorization to practice within that member state;
(3) complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes
their primary state of residence during the course of such an
investigation. The state licensing authority shall also be empowered to
report the results of such an investigation to the commission through
the data system as described herein;
(4) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that
require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the
production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority
in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in
the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in
proceedings before it. The issuing state licensing authority shall pay
any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by
the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are
located;
(5) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 33
licensee the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting
from any adverse action taken against that licensee; and
(6) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to
practice in that state based on the factual findings of another remote
state.
(d) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending
investigation of a cosmetologist who changes such licensee's primary
state of residence during the course of the investigation. The home state
shall also have the authority to take appropriate action and promptly
report the conclusions of the investigations to the data system.
(e) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a
licensee's multistate license, the licensee's authorization to practice in
all other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances
have been removed from the home state license. All home state
disciplinary orders that impose an adverse action against a licensee's
multistate license shall include a statement that the cosmetologist's
authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states during the
pendency of the order.
(f) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's
authority to accept a licensee's participation in an alternative program
in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license shall be
suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any
alternative program.
(g) Joint investigations.
(1) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its
respective scope of practice laws or other applicable state law, a
member state may participate with other member states in joint
investigations of licensees.
(2) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation or
compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual
investigation initiated under the compact.
ARTICLE 8—ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR
SPOUSES

THE COSMETOLOGY LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
(a) The compact member states create and establish a joint
government agency whose membership consists of all member states
that have enacted the compact, which shall be known as the
cosmetology licensure compact commission. The commission is an
instrumentality of the compact member states acting jointly and not an
instrumentality of any one state. The commission shall come into
existence on or after the effective date of the compact as set forth in
article 13.
(b) Membership, voting and meetings.
(1) Each member state shall have and be limited to one delegate

for the grant of a multistate license and thereafter, as may be
established by commission rule, charge the licensee a multistate license

to prevent a home state from charging a licensee a fee for a multistate
license or renewals of a multistate license or a fee for the jurisprudence
requirement if the member state imposes such a requirement for the
grant of a multistate license;
(13) assess and collect fees;
(14) accept any and all appropriate gifts, donations, grants of

action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the

(k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take
final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and
the full text of the rule.
(1) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
(2) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons
for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
commenters.
(3) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in article 11(l), the
effective date of the rule shall not be earlier than 45 days after the
commission issues notice that it has adopted or amended such rule.
(l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission
may consider and adopt an emergency rule with five days' notice, with
opportunity to comment, except the usual rulemaking procedures
provided in the compact and this article shall be retroactively applied to

necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses

and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated
on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not
relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
the period of default.
(4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the

assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
effective date of termination.
(6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this
compact, such state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees

terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted
pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
said notice of termination.

is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact
unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the

commission may initiate legal action against a member state in default
in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
federal district where the commission has its principal offices to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its adopted
rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.
In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party
shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorney fees. The remedies in this compact shall not be the exclusive
remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other
remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
(3) A member state may initiate legal action against the
commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and

compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state. On or
after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene
and review the enactment of each of the charter member states to
determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is
materially different than the model compact statute.
(1) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
the default process set forth in article 12.
(2) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall
remain in existence, and the compact shall remain in effect even if the

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 42
number of member states should be fewer than seven.
(3) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter
member states shall be subject to the process set forth in article 9(c)(24)
to determine if such enactments are materially different from the model
compact statute and whether the enactments qualify for participation in
the compact.

furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior
to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless

commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the
compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously
adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law
on the date that the compact becomes law in that state.

prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
(3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to
all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent
statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
(c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does
not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon
any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
ARTICLE 14—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall
be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall
not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely
for those purposes.
(b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact
and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person
or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
(c) Notwithstanding article 14(b), the commission may deny a
state's participation in the compact or terminate a member state's
participation in the compact, in accordance with the requirements of
article 12, if the commission determines that a constitutional
requirement of a member state is a material departure from the
compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the
constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force
and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect
as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.

member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent
of the conflict.

Sec. 4.
SECTION 1—PURPOSE
In order to strengthen access to medical services and in recognition
of the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating
states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing
authority of state licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and
seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while
safeguarding the safety of patients. This compact allows medical
services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of the
licensee's qualifying license by other compact-participating states. This
compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and
affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA
occurs where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter
and, therefore, requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the state
licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that
participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse
action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a PA through
the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate
burdens for military families by allowing active duty military personnel
and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having an
unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.
SECTION 2—DEFINITIONS

(a) "Adverse action" means any administrative, civil, equitable or
criminal action permitted by a state's laws that is imposed by a

restriction on the licensee's practice.

remote state to allow a licensee from another participating state to

state that is lawful in such other state for the purpose of taking adverse
action against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a

that issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect
to reported conduct received from any other participating state as it
would if the conduct had occurred within the participating state that
issued the qualifying license. The participating state shall apply its own
state laws to determine appropriate action.
(f) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may
recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition
of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.
(g) A participating state may take adverse action based on the
factual findings of a remote state if the participating state follows its
own procedures for taking the adverse action.

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 47
investigation initiated under this compact.

(1) The commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the
reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing
activities.
(2) The commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue
sources, donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials
and services.
(3) The commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment
from each participating state and may impose compact privilege fees on
licensees of participating states to which a compact privilege is granted
to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and
its staff. Such assessment shall be in a total amount sufficient to cover
the commission's annual budget as approved by the commission each
year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate
annual assessment amount levied on participating states shall be
allocated based upon a formula to be determined by commission rule.
Compact privileges and such compact privilege's associated fees shall
be governed as follows:
(A) A compact privilege expires when the licensee's qualifying
license in the participating state from which the licensee applied for the
compact privilege expires; and
(B) if the licensee terminates the qualifying license through which
the licensee applied for the compact privilege before its scheduled
expiration and the licensee has a qualifying license in another
participating state, the licensee shall inform the commission that it is
changing to that participating state through which it applies for a
compact privilege to that participating state and pay to the commission
any compact privilege fee required by commission rule.
(4) The commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to
securing the funds adequate to meet such obligations, nor shall the
commission pledge the credit of any of the participating states, except
by and with the authority of the participating state.
(5) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts
and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission
shall be subject to the financial review and accounting procedures
established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of funds
handled by the commission shall be subject to an annual financial
review by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of
the financial review shall be included in and become part of the annual
report of the commission.
(f) The executive committee.
(1) The executive committee shall have to power to act on behalf
of the commission according to the terms of this compact and
commission rules.

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 50
(2) The executive committee shall be composed of nine members
described as follows:
(A) Seven voting members who are elected by the commission
from the current membership of the commission;
(B) (i) (a) one ex officio, nonvoting member from a recognized
national PA professional association; and
(b) one ex officio, nonvoting member from a recognized national
PA certification organization.
(ii) The ex officio members shall be selected by their respective
organizations.
(3) The commission may remove any member of the executive
committee as provided in its bylaws.
(4) The executive committee shall meet at least annually.
(5) The executive committee shall have the following duties and
responsibilities:
(A) Recommend to the commission changes to the commission's
rules or bylaws, changes to this compact legislation, fees to be paid by
compact-participating states such as annual dues and any commission
compact fee charged to licensees for the compact privilege;
(B) ensure that compact administration services are appropriately
provided, whether contractual or otherwise;
(C) prepare and recommend the budget;
(D) maintain financial records on behalf of the commission;
(E) monitor compact compliance of participating states and
provide compliance reports to the commission;
(F) establish additional committees as necessary;
(G) exercise the powers and duties of the commission during the
interim between commission meetings, except for issuing proposed
rulemaking or adopting commission rules or bylaws or exercising any
other powers and duties exclusively reserved to the commission by the
commission's rules; and
(H) perform other duties as provided in the commission's rules or
bylaws.
(6) All meetings of the executive committee at which it votes or
plans to vote on matters in exercising the powers and duties of the
commission shall be open to the public and public notice of such
meetings shall be given as public meetings of the commission are
given.
(7) The executive committee may convene in a closed, nonpublic
meeting for the same reasons that the commission may convene in a
nonpublic meeting as set forth in subsection (d)(3), and shall announce
the closed meeting as the commission is required to do under
subsection (d)(4) and keep minutes of the closed meeting as the
commission is required to do under subsection (d)(5).
(g) Qualified immunity, defense and indemnification.
(1) The members, officers, executive director, employees and
representatives of the commission shall be immune from suit and
liability, both personally and in their official capacity, for any claim for
damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability
caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission
that occurred or that the individual against whom the claim is made had
a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
commission employment, duties or responsibilities. Nothing in this
paragraph shall be construed to protect any such individual from suit or
liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the
intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of such individual. The
procurement of insurance of any type by the commission shall not in
any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
(2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive
director, employee, and representative of the commission in any civil
action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged
act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of commission
employment, duties or responsibilities or as determined by the
commission that the individual against whom the claim is made had a

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 51
reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission
employment, duties or responsibilities. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit such individual from retaining such individual's
own counsel at the individual's own expense or that the actual or
alleged act, error or omission did not result from the individual's
intentional, willful or wanton misconduct.
(3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any
member, officer, executive director, employee or representative of the
commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained
against that individual arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or
omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment,
duties or responsibilities or that such individual had a reasonable basis
for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment,
duties or responsibilities, if the actual or alleged act, error or omission
did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of
that individual.
(4) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
in any proceedings as authorized by commission rules.
(5) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on
the liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct,
which shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
(6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to designate the
venue or jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice,
professional misconduct, negligence or other such civil action
pertaining to the practice of a PA. All such matters shall be determined
exclusively by state law other than this compact.
(7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or
otherwise abrogate a participating state's state action immunity or state
action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the
Sherman act, Clayton act or any other state or federal antitrust or
anticompetitive law or regulation.
(8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
sovereign immunity by the participating states or by the commission.
SECTION 8—DATA SYSTEM
(a) The commission shall provide for the development,
maintenance, operation and utilization of a coordinated data and
reporting system containing licensure, adverse action and the reporting
of the existence of significant investigative information on all licensed
PAs and applicants that are denied a license in participating states.
(b) Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a
participating state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on
all PAs to whom this compact is applicable, utilizing a unique
identifier, as required by the rules of the commission, including:
(1) Identifying information;
(2) licensure data;
(3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege;
(4) any denial of application for licensure and the reason for such
denial, excluding the reporting of any criminal history record
information where such reporting is prohibited by law;
(5) the existence of significant investigative information; and
(6) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
compact, as determined by the rules of the commission.
(c) Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
any participating state shall only be available to other participating
states.
(d) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states
of any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying
for a license that has been reported to such commission. Such adverse
action information shall be available to any other participating state.

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 52
(e) Participating states contributing information to the data system
may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that
shall not be shared with the public without the express permission of
the contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such
information shall be reported to the commission through the data
system.
(f) Any information submitted to the data system that is
subsequently expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the
participating state contributing the information shall be removed from
the data system upon reporting of such by the participating state to the
commission.
(g) The records and information provided to a participating state
pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when certified by
the commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated
business records of the commission and shall be entitled to any
associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or
administrative proceedings in a participating state.
SECTION 9—RULEMAKING
(a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant
to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.
Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
commission for each rule.
(b) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and
achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and have no
force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the
rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking
authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
compact, the powers granted hereunder or based upon another
applicable standard of review.
(c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
participating state, except that where the rules of the commission
conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the
medical services, a PA may perform in the participating state, as held
by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the rules of the commission
shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
(d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states
rejects a commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
same manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date
of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and
effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in
the compact.
(e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special
meeting of the commission.
(f) Prior to adoption of a final rule by the commission and at least
30 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered
and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed
rulemaking:
(1) On the commission's website or other publicly accessible
platform;
(2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's
notices of proposed rulemaking; and
(3) in such other ways as the commission may specify by rule.
(g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
(1) The time, date and location of the public hearing on the
proposed rule and the proposed time, date and location of the meeting
in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
(2) the text of and the reason for the proposed rule;
(3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any
interested person and the date by which written comments must be
received; and
(4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 53
the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or
provide any written comments.
(h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall
allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments,
which shall be made available to the public.
(i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the
commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic
hearing.
(1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed
in the notice of proposed rulemaking published not less than five
business days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the
commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
(2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner that provides each
person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to
comment orally or in writing.
(3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the
written comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments received in
response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a
person upon request.
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
separate hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped
for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this
section.
(j) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all
written and oral comments timely received.
(k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take
final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date
of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text
of the rule.
(1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission's
website.
(2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
changes do not expand the original purpose of the proposed rule.
(3) The commission shall provide an explanation on its website of
the reasons for any substantive changes made to the proposed rule as
well as reasons for any substantive changes not made that were
recommended by commenters.
(4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the
effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after the
commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
(l) Upon the determination that an emergency exists, the
commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
prior notice, without the opportunity for comment or hearing, expect
that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in
this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
reasonably possible but in no event later than 90 days after the effective
date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is
one that shall be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:
(1) Address an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
(2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
(3) meet a deadline for the adoption of a commission rule that is
established by federal law or rule; or
(4) protect public health and safety.
(m) The commission, or an authorized committee of the
commission, may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission
rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
errors in consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
revisions shall be posted on the commission's website. The revision
shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after
posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the
revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be
made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the
commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 54
made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If the
revision is challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the
approval of the commission.
(n) No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply
under this compact.
SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION
AND ENFORCEMENT
(a) Oversight.
(1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in
each participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions
necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses
to the extent that it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
(3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process
in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene
in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
commission with service of process shall render a judgment or order in
such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact or
commission rules.
(b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
(1) If the commission determines that a participating state has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide
written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default and any other action that the commission may take and shall
offer remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the
default.
(2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a
majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may
be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default
shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred
during the period of default.
(3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed
only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
defaulting state's legislature and to the licensing board of each of the
participating states.
(4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the
effective date of termination.
(5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that
is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact,
unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
defaulting state.
(6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the
compact by the commission by petitioning the United States district
court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(7) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact,

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 55
the state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that
state of such termination:
(A) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that
state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the
effective date of such termination; and
(B) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted
a compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact
privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license
in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating
state before the 180-day period ends, in which case, the compact
privilege shall continue.
(c) Dispute resolution.
(1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall
attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among
participating states and between participating and nonparticipating
states.
(2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both
mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
(d) Enforcement.
(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
shall enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the
commission.
(2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure
compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission
may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has
its principal offices against a participating state in default to enforce
compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commission's
adopted rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is
necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
under federal or state law.
(e) Legal action against the commission.
(1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the
commission in the United States district court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal
offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and
its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney fees.
(2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this
compact against the commission.
SECTION 11—DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
(a) This compact shall come into effect on the date that this
compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
(1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission
shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that
enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, called charter-
participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such
charter-participating state is materially different than the model
compact.
(A) A charter-participating state whose enactment is found to be
materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the
default process set forth in section 10(b).
(B) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or
its participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence
and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 56
participating states should be fewer than seven. Participating states
enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be
subject to the process set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their
enactments are materially different from the model compact and
whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the
seven initial charter-participating states shall be subject to the process
set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are
materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify
for participation in the compact.
(3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior
to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless
specifically repudiated by the commission.
(b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the
commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that this
compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously
adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law
on the day that this compact becomes law in that state.
(c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by
enacting a statute repealing the same.
(1) A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
days after enactment of the repealing statute. During the 180-day
period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing
state and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state
shall remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state
is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in
another participating state within the 180 days, the licensee's compact
privileges in other participating states shall not be affected by the
passage of the 180 days.
(2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
state licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the
investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact
prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
(3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this
compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal
to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue
to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
(d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
invalidate or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative
arrangement between participating states and between a participating
state and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the
provisions of this compact.
(e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No
amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon
any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner
into the laws of all participating states as determined by the
commission.
SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall
be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
compact expressly authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall
not be construed to limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely
for those purposes.
(b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any
phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,

HOUSE BILL No. 2069—page 57
person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact
and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person
or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or subsection
(b), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or,
in accordance with the requirements of section 10(b), terminate a
participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with
respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material
departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to
be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating
states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as
to all severable matters.
SECTION 13—BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
(b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact
are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
(c) All agreements between the commission and the participating
states are binding in accordance with their terms.
Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
publication in the statute book.
