28 by increasing the availability of qualified, licensed school psychologists
29 through the establishment of an efficient and streamlined pathway for
30 licensees to practice in other member states;

32 protect the health and safety of its residents by ensuring that only
33 qualified, licensed professionals are authorized to provide school
HB 2069—Am. by SC 2
1 psychological services within that state;
2 (e) requires school psychologists practicing within a member state to
3 comply with the scope of practice laws present in the state where the
4 school psychological services are being provided;

HB 2069—Am. by SC 14

17 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
18 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the

27 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
28 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
29 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months
30 after the date of said notice of termination.

35 petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or

4 legal action against a member state in default in the United States district
5 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
6 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
7 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may
8 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
9 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of

14 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission
15 in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the

17 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.

8 held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
9 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
10 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable

11 process law, to:
12 (1) Take adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege
13 within that member state; and
14 (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that
15 require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the
16 production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
17 member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
18 production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in
19 the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
20 practice and procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings
21 pending before that court. The issuing authority shall pay any witness
22 fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service
23 statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located.
24 (b) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action
25 against a licensee's home state license.

29 doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
30 appropriate action.
31 (d) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a
32 licensee who changes home states during the course of the
33 investigations. The home state shall also have authority to take
34 appropriate action and promptly report the conclusions of the
35 investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator
36 of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state of any
37 adverse actions.
38 (e) A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover
39 from the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of
40 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
41 (f) A member state may take adverse action based on the factual
42 findings of another remote state if the member state follows its own
43 procedures for taking the adverse action.
HB 2069—Am. by SC 25
1 (g) Joint investigations.
2 (1) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its
3 respective state law, any member state may participate with other
4 member states in joint investigations of licensees.
5 (2) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation or
6 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint investigation initiated
7 under the compact.
8 (h) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's
9 home state license resulting in an encumbrance on the home state
10 license, the licensee's compact privilege in all other member states shall
11 be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home
12 state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse
13 action against a licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's
14 compact privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency
15 of the order.
16 (i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an
17 unencumbered license as certified by the home state's licensing
18 authority, the licensee shall meet the requirements of section 4(a) and
19 follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact
20 privilege in any remote state.
21 (j) If a member state takes adverse action, such state shall promptly
22 notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data
23 system shall promptly notify the other member states state of any adverse
24 actions.
25 (k) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's
26 decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu
27 of adverse action.

39 executive director, employee and representative of the compact
40 commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
41 any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the

1 the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within
2 the scope of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities,

21 otherwise abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state
22 action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the
23 Sherman antitrust act of 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27 or any

31 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in
32 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
33 purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have
34 no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the

37 compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
38 applicable standard of review.
39 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law

41 or regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions
42 and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state
43 and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of

8 rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
9 same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of
10 adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and
11 effect in any member state.
12 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
13 compact commission.
14 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission

20 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
21 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly
22 accessible platform;
23 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the compact

28 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the
29 compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule
30 and, if different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the
31 compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
32 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference
33 or other means of communication, the compact commission shall
34 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
35 proposed rulemaking;
36 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;

42 written comments and documents received by the compact commission
43 in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
HB 2069—Am. by SC 34
1 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
2 separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the
3 convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this
4 section.

6 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record
7 and the full text of the rule.
8 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed
9 rule if the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed
10 rule.

12 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
13 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
14 commenters.
15 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective
16 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l),

23 retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but not
24 later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of

33 compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for
34 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
35 consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be
36 posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be
37 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.
38 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results
39 in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
40 delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice
41 period. If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without
42 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take
43 effect without the approval of the compact commission.
HB 2069—Am. by SC 35
1 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under
2 this compact.
3 SECTION 11—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
4 ENFORCEMENT
5 (a) Oversight.
6 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
7 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary
8 and appropriate to implement this compact.
9 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper
10 and judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
11 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where
12 the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact
13 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
14 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
15 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
16 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
17 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
18 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
19 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation
20 of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a
21 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission
22 service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
23 compact commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
24 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
25 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has
26 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
27 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
28 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
29 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
30 other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer
31 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
32 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
33 default to the other member states.
34 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
35 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
36 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
37 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated
38 on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
39 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
40 of default.
41 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
42 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
43 Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact

3 and each of the member states' licensing authority.
4 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
5 assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective

7 effective date of termination.
8 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this
9 compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees
10 within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall
11 continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this
12 compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of
13 termination.
14 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a
15 state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
16 compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the compact
17 commission and the defaulting state.
18 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact
19 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
20 of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has
21 its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
22 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
23 (i) Dispute resolution.
24 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall
25 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among
26 member states and among member and nonmember states.
27 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for

32 legal action against a member state in default in the United States
33 district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where
34 the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
35 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
36 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that
37 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded
38 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The
39 remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact
40 commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies
41 available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
42 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
43 commission in the United States district court for the District of
HB 2069—Am. by SC 37
1 Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its
2 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
3 compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both
4 injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is
5 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
6 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
7 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact
8 against the compact commission.
9 SECTION 12—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
10 AMENDMENT
11 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
12 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
13 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact
14 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
15 seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the
16 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different
17 than the model compact statute.
18 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
19 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to
20 the default process set forth in section 11.
21 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
22 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission
23 shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if
24 the number of member states should be fewer than seven.
25 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
26 initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
27 section 8(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
28 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for
29 participation in the compact.
30 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or
31 in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact
32 prior to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission
33 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact
34 commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
35 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
36 commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
37 the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes
38 law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
39 compact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the
40 day the compact becomes law in that state.
41 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting
42 a statute repealing such compact.
43 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
HB 2069—Am. by SC 38
1 after enactment of the repealing statute.
2 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
3 withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
4 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
5 effective date of withdrawal.
6 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact,
7 a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
8 licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
9 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to
10 recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a
11 minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
12 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
13 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
14 arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does
15 not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
16 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
17 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
18 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
19 SECTION 13—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
20 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking
21 authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes
22 and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions
23 of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
24 rules shall not be construed to limit the compact commission's
25 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
26 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
27 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
28 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
29 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
30 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
31 person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
32 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and
33 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
34 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
35 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the compact commission may
36 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
37 requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation
38 in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a
39 member state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact
40 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the
41 compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
42 member states and in full force and effect as to the member state
43 affected as to all severable matters.
HB 2069—Am. by SC 39
1 SECTION 14—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
2 OTHER STATE LAWS
3 (a) Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement
4 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
5 compact.
6 (b) Any laws, statutes, rules and regulations or other legal
7 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are
8 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
9 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission
10 and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
11 Sec. 2. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
12 publication in the statute book.

17 services are available and delivered by appropriately qualified
18 professionals in their educational settings.

21 equivalent license to practice in other member states without first
22 satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements;

24 among the member states in order to address workforce shortages and to
25 ensure that safe and reliable school psychological services are available in
26 each member state;
27 (c) enhances the public accessibility of school psychological services
28 by increasing the availability of qualified, licensed school psychologists
29 through the establishment of an efficient and streamlined pathway for
30 licensees to practice in other member states;

23 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of

27 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
28 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
29 licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months
30 after the date of said notice of termination.
31 (g) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is

37 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
38 reasonable attorney fees.

39 executive director, employee and representative of the compact
40 commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
41 any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the

HB 2069—Am. by SC 31
1 the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within
2 the scope of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities,

16 willful or wanton misconduct of that person.

30 SECTION 10—RULEMAKING
31 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in
32 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
33 purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have
34 no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the

37 compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another
38 applicable standard of review.
39 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law

42 and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state
43 and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of

HB 2069—Am. by SC 33

8 rule or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
9 same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of
10 adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and
11 effect in any member state.
12 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
13 compact commission.
14 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission

20 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
21 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly
22 accessible platform;
23 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the compact
24 commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and

26 specify.
27 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
28 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the
29 compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule
30 and, if different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the
31 compact commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
32 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference
33 or other means of communication, the compact commission shall
34 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
35 proposed rulemaking;
36 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
37 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any

40 comments.
41 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
42 written comments and documents received by the compact commission
43 in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.

HB 2069—Am. by SC 34
1 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
2 separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the
3 convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this
4 section.
5 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
6 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record
7 and the full text of the rule.
8 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed
9 rule if the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed
10 rule.
11 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the
12 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
13 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
14 commenters.
15 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective
16 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l),
17 the effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after

19 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact
20 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'

22 rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and this section shall be
23 retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but not
24 later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of
25 this provision, an emergency rule is one that shall be adopted
26 immediately in order to:

30 established by federal law or rule; or
31 (4) protect public health and safety.
32 (m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the
33 compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for
34 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
35 consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be
36 posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be
37 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.
38 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results
39 in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
40 delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice
41 period. If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without
42 further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take
43 effect without the approval of the compact commission.

HB 2069—Am. by SC 35
1 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under

3 SECTION 11—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND

6 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
7 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary
8 and appropriate to implement this compact.
9 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper
10 and judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
11 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where
12 the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact
13 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
14 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
15 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
16 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
17 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
18 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
19 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation
20 of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a
21 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission
22 service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
23 compact commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
24 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
25 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has
26 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
27 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
28 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
29 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
30 other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer
31 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
32 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
33 default to the other member states.
34 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
35 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
36 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
37 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated
38 on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
39 the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
40 of default.
41 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
42 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.
43 Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact

HB 2069—Am. by SC 36
1 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
2 defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority
3 and each of the member states' licensing authority.

9 compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees

11 continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this
12 compact for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of
13 termination.
14 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a
15 state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
16 compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the compact
17 commission and the defaulting state.
18 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact
19 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
20 of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has
21 its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
22 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
23 (i) Dispute resolution.
24 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall
25 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among
26 member states and among member and nonmember states.
27 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
28 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
29 appropriate.
30 (j) Enforcement.
31 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate
32 legal action against a member state in default in the United States
33 district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where
34 the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
35 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief
36 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that
37 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded
38 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The
39 remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact
40 commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies
41 available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
42 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
43 commission in the United States district court for the District of

HB 2069—Am. by SC 37
1 Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its
2 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
3 compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both
4 injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is
5 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
6 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
7 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact
8 against the compact commission.
9 SECTION 12—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND

13 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact
14 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
15 seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the
16 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different
17 than the model compact statute.

25 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
26 initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in

29 participation in the compact.
30 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or
31 in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact

35 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
36 commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
37 the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes

5 effective date of withdrawal.
6 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact,
7 a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all

11 minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
12 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to
13 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
14 arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does
15 not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
16 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
17 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
18 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
19 SECTION 13—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
20 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking
21 authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes
22 and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions
23 of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of
24 rules shall not be construed to limit the compact commission's
25 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
26 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
27 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court
28 of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
29 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
30 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
31 person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
32 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and
33 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
34 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
35 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the compact commission may
36 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
37 requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation
38 in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a
39 member state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact
40 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the
41 compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
42 member states and in full force and effect as to the member state
43 affected as to all severable matters.

HB 2069—Am. by SC 39
1 SECTION 14—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
2 OTHER STATE LAWS
3 (a) Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement
4 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
5 compact.
6 (b) Any laws, statutes, rules and regulations or other legal
7 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are
8 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
9 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission
10 and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
11 Sec. 2. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
12 publication in the statute book.
