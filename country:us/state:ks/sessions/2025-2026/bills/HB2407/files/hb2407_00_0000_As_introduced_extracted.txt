26 theory of discrimination, may, personally or by an attorney-at-law, make,

33 the particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be
34 required by the commission.
35 (b) The commission upon its own initiative or the attorney general
36 may, in like manner, make, sign and file such complaint. Whenever the
37 attorney general has sufficient reason to believe that any person as herein
38 defined is engaged in a practice of discrimination, segregation or

1 (c) Whenever any problem of discrimination because of race,
2 religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or, ancestry, sexual
3 orientation, gender identity or expression or status as a veteran arises, or

5 reason to believe that any person has engaged in an unlawful employment
6 practice or an unlawful discriminatory practice in violation of this act, or
7 has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination, the commission may
8 conduct an investigation without filing a complaint and shall have the
9 same powers during such investigation as provided for the investigation of
10 complaints. The person to be investigated shall be advised of the nature
11 and scope of such investigation prior to its commencement. The purpose of
12 the investigation shall be to resolve any such problems promptly. In the
13 event such problems cannot be resolved within a reasonable time, the
14 commission may issue a complaint whenever the investigation has
15 revealed a violation of the Kansas act against discrimination has occurred.
16 The information gathered in the course of the first investigation may be
17 used in processing the complaint.
18 (d) After the filing of any complaint by an aggrieved individual, by
19 the commission, or by the attorney general, the commission shall, within
20 seven days after the filing of the complaint, serve a copy on each of the
21 parties alleged to have violated this act, and shall designate one of the
22 commissioners to make, with the assistance of the commission's staff,
23 prompt investigation of the alleged act of discrimination. If the
24 commissioner shall determine after such investigation that no probable
25 cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint, such
26 commissioner, within 10 business days from such determination, shall
27 cause to be issued and served upon the complainant and respondent written
28 notice of such determination.
29 (e) If such commissioner after such investigation, shall determine that
30 probable cause exists for crediting the allegations for the complaint, the
31 commissioner or such other commissioner as the commission may
32 designate, shall immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful
33 employment practice or the unlawful discriminatory practice complained
34 of by conference and conciliation. The complainant, respondent and
35 commission shall have 45 days from the date respondent is notified in
36 writing of a finding of probable cause to enter into a conciliation
37 agreement signed by all parties in interest. The parties may amend a
38 conciliation agreement at any time prior to the date of entering into such
39 agreement. Upon agreement by the parties the time for entering into such
40 agreement may be extended. The members of the commission and its staff
41 shall not disclose what has transpired in the course of such endeavors.
42 (f) In case of failure to eliminate such practices by conference and
43 conciliation, or in advance thereof, if in the judgment of the commissioner

HB 2407 9
1 or the commission circumstances so warrant, the commissioner or the
2 commission shall commence a hearing in accordance with the provisions
3 of the Kansas administrative procedure act naming as parties the
4 complainant and the person, employer, labor organization, employment
5 agency, realtor or financial institution named in such complaint,
6 hereinafter referred to as respondent. A copy of the complaint shall be
7 served on the respondent. At least four commissioners or a presiding
8 officer from the office of administrative hearings shall be designated as the
9 presiding officer. The place of such hearing shall be in the county where
10 respondent is doing business and the acts complained of occurred.
11 (g) The complainant or respondent may apply to the presiding officer
12 for the issuance of a subpoena for the attendance of any person or the
13 production or examination of any books, records or documents pertinent to
14 the proceeding at the hearing. Upon such application the presiding officer
15 shall issue such subpoena.
16 (h) The case in support of the complaint shall be presented before the
17 presiding officer by one of the commission's attorneys or agents, or by
18 private counsel, if any, of the complainant, and the commissioner who
19 shall have previously made the investigation shall not participate in the
20 hearing except as a witness. Any endeavors at conciliation shall not be
21 received in evidence.
22 (i) Any complaint filed pursuant to this act must be so filed within six
23 months after the alleged act of discrimination, unless the act complained of
24 constitutes a continuing pattern or practice of discrimination in which
25 event it will be from the last act of discrimination. Complaints filed with
26 the commission may be dismissed by the commission on its own initiative,
27 and shall be dismissed by the commission upon the written request of the
28 complainant, if the commission has not issued a finding of probable cause
29 or no probable cause or taken other administrative action dismissing the
30 complaint within 300 days of the filing of the complaint. The commission
31 shall mail written notice to all parties of dismissal of a complaint within
32 five days of dismissal. Any such dismissal of a complaint in accordance
33 with this section shall constitute final action by the commission which
34 shall be deemed to exhaust all administrative remedies under the Kansas
35 act against discrimination for the purpose of allowing subsequent filing of
36 the matter in court by the complainant, without the requirement of filing a
37 petition for reconsideration pursuant to K.S.A. 44-1010, and amendments
38 thereto. Dismissal of a complaint in accordance with this section shall not
39 be subject to appeal or judicial review by any court under the provisions of
40 K.S.A. 44-1011, and amendments thereto. The provisions of this section
41 shall not apply to complaints alleging discriminatory housing practices
42 filed with the commission pursuant to K.S.A. 44-1015 et seq., and
43 amendments thereto.
