governor pursuant to K.S.A. 48-924, and amendments thereto, or a
state of local disaster emergency declared pursuant to K.S.A. 48-932,

in the district court of the county where the order was issued within 30
days after such order is issued. A request for a hearing shall not stay or
enjoin an isolation or quarantine order. The court shall conduct a
hearing within 72 hours after receipt of a petition in any such action.
The court shall grant the request for relief unless the court finds that
such order is narrowly tailored to the purpose stated in the order and
uses the least restrictive means to achieve such purpose.
