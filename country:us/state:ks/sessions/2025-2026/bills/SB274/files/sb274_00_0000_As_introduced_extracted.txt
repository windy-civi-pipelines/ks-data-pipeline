10 policy, the state corporation commission shall engage an outside
11 consulting firm to conduct a technical and legal feasibility study regarding
12 the promotion of nuclear energy generation in this state. The commission
13 shall choose a consulting firm that:
14 (A) Is well-established in the nuclear industry and has been in
15 existence for more than 35 years;
16 (B) currently has or has had at least 90% of the existing nuclear
17 operators in the United States as a customer within the preceding 10 years;
18 (C) has earned 50% of the firm's revenue from nuclear licensing over
19 the preceding 20 years; and
20 (D) is staffed by a licensed attorney who has experience in assisting
21 entities with submitting and obtaining regulatory licenses, certifications
22 and approvals for new reactor designs pursuant to 10 C.F.R. part 52.
23 (2) In addition to the foregoing requirements, if competent to perform
24 such services as defined in K.S.A. 73-201(a)(2), and amendments thereto,
25 the commission shall give preference to a consulting firm that is managed

27 individuals who are military veterans and whose military service included
28 nuclear operating experiences.
29 (3) The provisions of K.S.A. 75-3739 et seq., and amendments
30 thereto, shall not apply to any contract established pursuant to this section.
31 (b) The feasibility study conducted by such firm shall consider the

33 (1) The advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy generation in
34 this state, including, but not limited to, the economic and environmental
35 impacts;
36 (2) ways to maximize the use of workers who reside in this state and
SB 274 2
1 products made in this state in the construction of nuclear energy generation
2 facilities;
3 (3) evaluations, conclusions and recommendations on the following:
4 (A) Design characteristics and evaluation, including specific
5 recommendations of optimal designs based on site characteristics and
6 possible industrial uses;
7 (B) environmental and ecological impacts;
8 (C) land and siting criteria, including specific areas that are best
9 suited for new nuclear generation based on the land and siting criteria;
10 (D) safety criteria;

23 coordinating with other advanced, clean energy technologies, including,
24 but not limited to, hydrogen, direct air capture of carbon dioxide and
25 energy storage;
26 (7) literature review of studies that have assessed the potential impact
27 of nuclear energy generation in supporting an energy transition; and
28 (8) assessment and recommendation of current and future policies
29 that may be needed to support or accelerate the adoption of nuclear energy
30 generation or may improve its cost-effectiveness, including a survey of
31 federal programs and other methods that could financially assist a nuclear
32 project in this state.
33 (c) The state corporation commission, public utilities, cooperatives
