40 which to present oral argument.
41 (4) At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the proceeding, the
42 court shall provide oral and written instructions to the jury to guide its

SB 245 23
1 amendments thereto, as an aggravating circumstance, and the court finds
2 that one or more of the defendant's prior convictions satisfy such
3 subsection, the jury shall be instructed that a certified journal entry of a
4 prior conviction is presumed to prove the existence of such prior
5 conviction or convictions beyond a reasonable doubt.
6 (5) If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt
7 that one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in K.S.A.
8 21-6624, and amendments thereto, exist, the jury shall designate, in

18 reasonable doubt pursuant to this subsection, the defendant shall be
19 sentenced pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6623, and amendments thereto, unless the
20 sentencing judge finds substantial and compelling reasons, following a
21 review of mitigating circumstances, to impose the sentence specified in
22 this paragraph. If the sentencing judge does not impose the mandatory
23 minimum term of imprisonment required by K.S.A. 21-6623, and
24 amendments thereto, the judge shall state on the record at the time of
25 sentencing the substantial and compelling reasons therefor, and the
26 defendant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life and shall not be
27 eligible for probation or suspension, modification or reduction of sentence.
28 In addition, the defendant shall not be eligible for parole prior to serving
29 25 years' imprisonment, and such 25 years' imprisonment shall not be

39 defendant shall be required to serve a mandatory minimum term of
40 imprisonment of 40 years or for crimes committed on and after July 1,
41 1999, a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 50 years or
42 sentenced as otherwise provided by law.
43 (2) The sentencing proceeding shall be conducted by the court before

2 sentencing, a new jury shall be impaneled. Any decision to impose a
3 mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 40 or 50 years shall be by a
4 unanimous jury. Jury selection procedures, qualifications of jurors and
5 grounds for exemption or challenge of prospective jurors in criminal trials
6 shall be applicable to the selection of such jury. The jury at the sentencing
7 proceeding may be waived in the manner provided by K.S.A. 22-3403, and
8 amendments thereto, for waiver of a trial jury. If the jury at the sentencing
9 proceeding has been waived, such proceeding shall be conducted by the
10 court.
11 (3) In the sentencing proceeding, evidence may be presented
12 concerning any matter that the court deems relevant to the question of
13 sentence and shall include matters relating to any of the aggravating
14 circumstances enumerated in K.S.A. 21-6624, and amendments thereto, or
15 for crimes committed prior to July 1, 2011, K.S.A. 21-4636, prior to its
16 repeal, and any mitigating circumstances. Any such evidence which that
17 the court deems to have probative value may be received regardless of its
18 admissibility under the rules of evidence, provided that the defendant is
19 accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any hearsay statements. Only such
20 evidence of aggravating circumstances as the prosecuting attorney has
21 made known to the defendant prior to the sentencing proceeding shall be
22 admissible and no evidence secured in violation of the constitution of the
23 United States or of the state of Kansas shall be admissible. Only such
24 evidence of mitigating circumstances subject to discovery pursuant to
25 K.S.A. 22-3212, and amendments thereto, that the defendant has made
26 known to the prosecuting attorney prior to the sentencing proceeding shall
27 be admissible. No testimony by the defendant at the time of sentencing
28 shall be admissible against the defendant at any subsequent criminal
29 proceeding. At the conclusion of the evidentiary presentation, the court
30 shall allow the parties a reasonable period of time in which to present oral
31 argument.
32 (4) At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the sentencing

35 6624(a), and amendments thereto, or for crimes committed prior to July 1,
36 2011, K.S.A. 21-4636(a), prior to its repeal, as an aggravating
37 circumstance, and the court finds that one or more of the defendant's prior
38 convictions satisfy such subsection, the jury shall be instructed that a
39 certified journal entry of a prior conviction is presumed to prove the
40 existence of such prior conviction or convictions beyond a reasonable
41 doubt.
42 (5) If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt
43 that one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in K.S.A.
SB 245 25
1 21-6624, and amendments thereto, or for crimes committed prior to July 1,
2 2011, K.S.A. 21-4636, prior to its repeal, exist and, further, that the
3 existence of such aggravating circumstances is not outweighed by any
4 mitigating circumstances which that are found to exist, the defendant shall
5 be sentenced pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6623, and amendments thereto;
6 otherwise, the defendant shall be sentenced as provided by law. The

13 for the purpose of determining whether to sentence such defendant to
14 death. If, after a reasonable time for deliberation, the jury is unable to

16 the defendant shall be sentenced as provided by law. In nonjury cases, the
17 court shall designate in writing the specific circumstance or circumstances

34 aggravating circumstances, resentencing shall be required under this
35 section, as amended by chapter 1 of the 2013 Session Laws of Kansas
36 (Special Session), unless the prosecuting attorney chooses not to pursue
37 such a sentence.
38 (h) In the event any sentence imposed under this section is held to be

22 (6) As used in this subsection, "sexually motivated" means that one of
23 the purposes for which the defendant committed the crime was for the
24 purpose of the defendant's sexual gratification.
25 (e) If an inmate is sentenced to imprisonment for a crime committed
26 while on parole or conditional release, the inmate shall be eligible for
27 parole as provided by subsection (c), except that the prisoner review board
28 may postpone the inmate's parole eligibility date by assessing a penalty not
29 exceeding the period of time which that could have been assessed if the
30 inmate's parole or conditional release had been violated for reasons other
31 than conviction of a crime.
32 (f) If a person is sentenced to prison for a crime committed on or after
33 July 1, 1993, while on probation, parole, conditional release or in a
34 community corrections program, for a crime committed prior to July 1,
35 1993, and the person is not eligible for retroactive application of the
36 sentencing guidelines and amendments thereto pursuant to K.S.A. 21-
37 4724, prior to its repeal, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the
38 old sentence, but shall begin when the person is paroled or reaches the
39 conditional release date on the old sentence. If the offender was past the
40 offender's conditional release date at the time the new offense was
41 committed, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the old sentence
42 but shall begin when the person is ordered released by the prisoner review
43 board or reaches the maximum sentence expiration date on the old
SB 245 38
1 sentence, whichever is earlier. The new sentence shall then be served as
2 otherwise provided by law. The period of postrelease supervision shall be
3 based on the new sentence, except that those offenders whose old sentence
4 is a term of imprisonment for life, imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 1993 Supp.
5 21-4628, prior to its repeal, or an indeterminate sentence with a maximum
6 term of life imprisonment, for which there is no conditional release or
7 maximum sentence expiration date, shall remain on postrelease
8 supervision for life or until discharged from supervision by the prisoner
9 review board.
10 (g) Subject to the provisions of this section, the prisoner review board
11 may release on parole those persons confined in institutions who are
12 eligible for parole when: (1) The board believes that the inmate should be
13 released for hospitalization, deportation or to answer the warrant or other
14 process of a court and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability
15 that the inmate can be released without detriment to the community or to
16 the inmate; or (2) the secretary of corrections has reported to the board in
17 writing that the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required
18 by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments
19 thereto, or any revision of such agreement, and the board believes that the
20 inmate is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law abiding citizen
21 and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability that the inmate
22 can be released without detriment to the community or to the inmate.
23 Parole shall not be granted as an award of clemency and shall not be
24 considered a reduction of sentence or a pardon.
25 (h) The prisoner review board shall hold a parole hearing at least the
26 month prior to the month an inmate will be eligible for parole under
27 subsections (a), (b) and (c). At least one month preceding the parole
28 hearing, the county or district attorney of the county where the inmate was
29 convicted shall give written notice of the time and place of the public
30 comment sessions for the inmate to any victim of the inmate's crime who
31 is alive and whose address is known to the county or district attorney or, if
32 the victim is deceased, to the victim's family if the family's address is
33 known to the county or district attorney. Except as otherwise provided,
34 failure to notify pursuant to this section shall not be a reason to postpone a
35 parole hearing. In the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
36 a class A felony, the secretary of corrections shall give written notice of the
37 time and place of the public comment session for such inmate at least one
38 month preceding the public comment session to any victim of such
39 inmate's crime or the victim's family pursuant to K.S.A. 74-7338, and
40 amendments thereto. If notification is not given to such victim or such
41 victim's family in the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
42 a class A felony, the board shall postpone a decision on parole of the
43 inmate to a time at least 30 days after notification is given as provided in
SB 245 39
1 this section. Nothing in this section shall create a cause of action against
2 the state or an employee of the state acting within the scope of the
3 employee's employment as a result of the failure to notify pursuant to this
4 section. If granted parole, the inmate may be released on parole on the date
5 specified by the board, but not earlier than the date the inmate is eligible
6 for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At each parole hearing and, if
7 parole is not granted, at such intervals thereafter as it determines
8 appropriate, the board shall consider: (1) Whether the inmate has
9 satisfactorily completed the programs required by any agreement entered
10 under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, or any revision of such
11 agreement; and (2) all pertinent information regarding such inmate,
12 including, but not limited to, the circumstances of the offense of the
13 inmate; the presentence report; the previous social history and criminal
14 record of the inmate; the conduct, employment, and attitude of the inmate
15 in prison; the reports of such physical and mental examinations as have
16 been made, including, but not limited to, risk factors revealed by any risk
17 assessment of the inmate; comments of the victim and the victim's family
18 including in person comments, contemporaneous comments and
19 prerecorded comments made by any technological means; comments of
20 the public; official comments; any recommendation by the staff of the
21 facility where the inmate is incarcerated; proportionality of the time the
22 inmate has served to the sentence a person would receive under the Kansas
23 sentencing guidelines for the conduct that resulted in the inmate's
24 incarceration; and capacity of state correctional institutions.
25 (i) In those cases involving inmates sentenced for a crime committed
26 after July 1, 1993, the prisoner review board will review the inmate's
27 proposed release plan. The board may schedule a hearing if they desire.
28 The board may impose any condition they deem necessary to insure public
29 safety, aid in the reintegration of the inmate into the community, or items
30 not completed under the agreement entered into under K.S.A. 75-5210a,
31 and amendments thereto. The board may not advance or delay an inmate's
32 release date. Every inmate while on postrelease supervision shall remain in
33 the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders
34 of the secretary.
35 (j) (1) Before ordering the parole of any inmate, the prisoner review
36 board shall have the inmate appear either in person or via a video
37 conferencing format and shall interview the inmate unless impractical
38 because of the inmate's physical or mental condition or absence from the
39 institution. Every inmate while on parole shall remain in the legal custody
40 of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary.
41 Whenever the board formally considers placing an inmate on parole and
42 no agreement has been entered into with the inmate under K.S.A. 75-
43 5210a, and amendments thereto, the board shall notify the inmate in
SB 245 40
1 writing of the reasons for not granting parole. If an agreement has been
2 entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the inmate
3 has not satisfactorily completed the programs specified in the agreement,
4 or any revision of such agreement, the board shall notify the inmate in
5 writing of the specific programs the inmate must satisfactorily complete
6 before parole will be granted. If parole is not granted only because of a
7 failure to satisfactorily complete such programs, the board shall grant
8 parole upon the secretary's certification that the inmate has successfully
9 completed such programs. If an agreement has been entered under K.S.A.
10 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the secretary of corrections has
11 reported to the board in writing that the inmate has satisfactorily
12 completed the programs required by such agreement, or any revision
13 thereof, the board shall not require further program participation.
14 However, if the board determines that other pertinent information
15 regarding the inmate warrants the inmate's not being released on parole,
16 the board shall state in writing the reasons for not granting the parole. If
17 parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a crime other than a class A or
18 class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole
19 hearing for the inmate not later than one year after the denial unless the
20 board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted
21 at a hearing if held in the next three years or during the interim period of a
22 deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for
23 up to three years but any such deferral by the board shall require the board
24 to state the basis for its findings. If parole is denied for an inmate
25 sentenced for a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board
26 shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than three years
27 after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect
28 that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next 10 years or
29 during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer
30 subsequent parole hearings for up to 10 years, but any such deferral shall
31 require the board to state the basis for its findings.
32 (2) Inmates sentenced for a class A or class B felony who have not
33 had a board hearing in the five years prior to July 1, 2010, shall have such
34 inmates' cases reviewed by the board on or before July 1, 2012. Such
35 review shall begin with the inmates with the oldest deferral date and
36 progress to the most recent. Such review shall be done utilizing existing
37 resources unless the board determines that such resources are insufficient.
38 If the board determines that such resources are insufficient, then the
39 provisions of this paragraph are subject to appropriations therefor.
40 (k) (1) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision shall be
41 assigned, upon release, to the appropriate level of supervision pursuant to
42 the criteria established by the secretary of corrections.
43 (2) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
SB 245 41
1 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
2 effects, vehicle, residence and property by a parole officer or a department
3 of corrections enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any
4 time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or
5 without cause. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize
6 such officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the
7 sole purpose of harassment.
8 (3) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
9 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
10 effects, vehicle, residence and property by any law enforcement officer
11 based on reasonable suspicion of the person violating conditions of parole
12 or postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Any
13 law enforcement officer who conducts such a search shall submit a written
14 report to the appropriate parole officer no later than the close of the next
15 business day after such search. The written report shall include the facts
16 leading to such search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting
17 from such search.
18 (l) The prisoner review board shall promulgate rules and regulations
19 in accordance with K.S.A. 77-415 et seq., and amendments thereto, not
20 inconsistent with the law and as it may deem proper or necessary, with
21 respect to the conduct of parole hearings, postrelease supervision reviews,
22 revocation hearings, orders of restitution, reimbursement of expenditures
23 by the state board of indigents' defense services and other conditions to be
24 imposed upon parolees or releasees. Whenever an order for parole or
25 postrelease supervision is issued it shall recite the conditions thereof.
26 (m) Whenever the prisoner review board orders the parole of an
27 inmate or establishes conditions for an inmate placed on postrelease
28 supervision, the board shall require that the inmate:
29 (1) Obey all laws and ordinances and report any law enforcement
30 contact to the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after such
31 contact;
32 (2) not engage in physical violence or threats of violence of any kind
33 and, if the inmate is being supervised for conviction of a felony, not
34 purchase or possess a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, while on
35 supervision;

37 truthful in all matters;
38 (4) remain within the state of Kansas or other specified areas as

42 notify the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after any emergency
43 changes in residence or contact information;
SB 245 42
1 (6) not possess, use or distribute any controlled substances except

11 (10) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
12 residence and property by a parole officer or a department of corrections
13 enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any time of the day

15 except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize such
16 officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the sole
17 purpose of harassment;
18 (11) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,

23 contact a victim as part of rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes;

28 render a plan of payment unworkable, reimburse the state for all or part of
29 the expenditures by the state board of indigents' defense services to
30 provide counsel and other defense services to the person. In determining
31 the amount and method of payment of such sum, the prisoner review board
32 shall take account of the financial resources of the person and the nature of
33 the burden that the payment of such sum will impose. Such amount shall
34 not exceed the amount claimed by appointed counsel on the payment
35 voucher for indigents' defense services or the amount prescribed by the
36 board of indigents' defense services reimbursement tables as provided in
37 K.S.A. 22-4522, and amendments thereto, whichever is less, minus any
38 previous payments for such services.
39 (n) Any law enforcement officer who conducts a search pursuant to
40 subsection (m)(11) shall submit a written report to the inmate's parole
41 officer not later than the close of business the next day after such search is
42 conducted. The written report shall include the facts leading to such
43 search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting from such
SB 245 43
1 search.
2 (o) If the court that sentenced an inmate specified at the time of
3 sentencing the amount and the recipient of any restitution ordered as a
4 condition of parole or postrelease supervision, the prisoner review board
5 shall order as a condition of parole or postrelease supervision that the
6 inmate pay restitution in the amount and manner provided in the journal
7 entry unless the board finds compelling circumstances that would render a
8 plan of restitution unworkable.
9 (p) Whenever the prisoner review board grants the parole of an
10 inmate, the board, within 14 days of the date of the decision to grant
11 parole, shall give written notice of the decision to the county or district
12 attorney of the county where the inmate was sentenced.
13 (q) When an inmate is to be released on postrelease supervision, the

15 district attorney of the county where the inmate was sentenced written
16 notice of the release date.
17 (r) Inmates shall be released on postrelease supervision upon the
18 termination of the prison portion of their sentence. Time served while on
19 postrelease supervision will vest.
20 (s) An inmate who is allocated regular good time credits as provided
21 in K.S.A. 22-3725, and amendments thereto, may receive meritorious
22 good time credits in increments of not more than 90 days per meritorious
23 act. These credits may be awarded by the secretary of corrections when an
24 inmate has acted in a heroic or outstanding manner in coming to the
25 assistance of another person in a life-threatening situation, preventing
26 injury or death to a person, preventing the destruction of property or taking
27 actions that result in a financial savings to the state.

21 person to be electronically monitored pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6604(r), and
22 amendments thereto, the board shall order the person to reimburse the state
23 for all or part of the cost of such monitoring. In determining the amount

41 shall provide a copy of such court order to the registering law enforcement
42 agency at the time of registration. The registering law enforcement agency
43 shall forward a copy of such court order to the Kansas bureau of
SB 245 55
1 investigation.
2 If such offender violates a condition of release during the term of the
3 conditional release, the court may require such offender to register
4 pursuant to paragraph (1) subsection (f).
5 (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, for an
6 offender 14 years of age or more who is adjudicated as a juvenile offender
7 for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a sexually
8 violent crime set forth in K.S.A. 22-4902(c), and amendments thereto, and
9 such crime is not an off-grid felony or a felony ranked in severity level 1
10 of the nondrug grid as provided in K.S.A. 21-4704, prior to its repeal, or
11 K.S.A. 21-6804, and amendments thereto, the court shall:

26 agency at the time of registration. The registering law enforcement agency

28 investigation.
29 If such offender violates a condition of release during the term of the
30 conditional release, the court may require such offender to register
31 pursuant to paragraph (1) subsection (g).
32 (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, an offender
33 14 or more years of age or more who is adjudicated as a juvenile offender
34 for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a sexually
35 violent crime set forth in K.S.A. 22-4902(c), and amendments thereto, and
36 such crime is an off-grid felony or a felony ranked in severity level 1 of
37 the nondrug grid as provided in K.S.A. 21-4704, prior to its repeal, or
38 K.S.A. 21-6804, and amendments thereto, shall be required to register for
39 such offender's lifetime.
40 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a diversionary
41 agreement or probation order, either adult or juvenile, or a juvenile
42 offender sentencing order, requires registration under the Kansas offender
43 registration act for an offense that would not otherwise require registration
SB 245 56
1 as provided in K.S.A. 22-4902(a)(5), and amendments thereto, then all
2 provisions of the Kansas offender registration act shall apply, except that
3 the duration of registration shall be controlled by such diversionary
4 agreement, probation order or juvenile offender sentencing order.
5 (j) The duration of registration does not terminate if the convicted or
6 adjudicated offender again becomes liable to register as provided by the
7 Kansas offender registration act during the required period of registration.

10 an out-of-state law, the duration of registration shall be the length of time
11 required by the out-of-state jurisdiction or by the Kansas offender
12 registration act, whichever length of time is longer. The provisions of this
13 subsection shall apply to convictions or adjudications prior to June 1,
14 2006, and to persons who moved to Kansas prior to June l, 2006, and to

16 moved to Kansas on or after June l, 2006.
17 (l) For any person residing, maintaining employment or attending
18 school in this state who has been convicted or adjudicated by an out-of-
19 state court of an offense that is comparable to any crime requiring
20 registration pursuant to the Kansas offender registration act, but who was
21 not required to register in the jurisdiction of conviction or adjudication, the
22 duration of registration shall be the duration required for the comparable
23 offense pursuant to the Kansas offender registration act.
24 Sec. 19. K.S.A. 23-3222 is hereby amended to read as follows: 23-
25 3222. (a) Except as provided in subsection (d), a parent entitled to legal
26 custody or residency of or parenting time with a child under this article
27 shall give written notice to the other parent not less than 30 days prior to:
28 (1) Changing the residence of the child; or (2) removing the child from this
29 state for a period of time exceeding 90 days. Such notice shall be sent by
30 restricted mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the
31 other parent.
32 (b) Failure to give notice as required by subsection (a) is an indirect
33 civil contempt punishable as provided by law. In addition, the court may
34 assess, against the parent required to give notice, reasonable attorney fees
35 and any other expenses incurred by the other parent by reason of the
36 failure to give notice.
37 (c) A change of the residence or the removal of a child as described in
38 subsection (a) may be considered a material change of circumstances
39 which justifies modification of a prior order of legal custody, residency,
40 child support or parenting time. In determining any motion seeking a
41 modification of a prior order based on change of residence or removal as
42 described in (a), the court shall consider all factors the court deems
43 appropriate including, but not limited to: (1) The effect of the move on the
SB 245 57
1 best interests of the child; (2) the effect of the move on any party having
2 rights granted under this article; and (3) the increased cost the move will
3 impose on any party seeking to exercise rights granted under this article.
4 (d) A parent entitled to the legal custody or residency of a child under
5 this article shall not be required to give the notice required by this section
6 to the other parent when the other parent has been convicted of any crime
7 specified in article 34, 35 or 36 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes
8 Annotated, or K.S.A. 21-5401, prior to their repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5401 21-
9 5402 through 21-5609, section 2, 21-6104, 21-6325, 21-6326 or 21-6419
10 through 21-6422, and amendments thereto, in which the child is the victim
11 of such crime.
12 Sec. 20. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2255 is hereby amended to read as
13 follows: 38-2255. (a) Considerations. Prior to entering an order of
14 disposition, the court shall give consideration to:
15 (1) The child's physical, mental and emotional condition;
16 (2) the child's need for assistance;
17 (3) the manner in which the parent participated in the abuse, neglect
18 or abandonment of the child;
19 (4) any relevant information from the intake and assessment process;
20 and
21 (5) the evidence received at the dispositional hearing.
22 (b) Custody with a parent. The court may place the child in the
23 custody of either of the child's parents subject to terms and conditions
24 which the court prescribes to assure the proper care and protection of the
25 child, including, but not limited to:
26 (1) Supervision of the child and the parent by a court services officer;
27 (2) participation by the child and the parent in available programs
28 operated by an appropriate individual or agency; and
29 (3) any special treatment or care which the child needs for the child's
30 physical, mental or emotional health and safety.
31 (c) Removal of a child from custody of a parent. The court shall not
32 enter the initial order removing a child from the custody of a parent
33 pursuant to this section unless the court first finds probable cause that:
34 (1) (A) The child is likely to sustain harm if not immediately removed
35 from the home;
36 (B) allowing the child to remain in home is contrary to the welfare of
37 the child; or
38 (C) immediate placement of the child is in the best interest of the
39 child; and
40 (2) reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the family unit and
41 prevent the unnecessary removal of the child from the child's home or that
42 an emergency exists that threatens the safety to the child.
43 The court shall not enter an order removing a child from the custody of
SB 245 58
1 a parent pursuant to this section based solely on the finding that the parent
2 is homeless.
3 (d) Custody of a child removed from the custody of a parent. If the
4 court has made the findings required by subsection (c), the court shall
5 enter an order awarding custody to: A relative of the child or to a person
6 with whom the child has close emotional ties who shall not be required to
7 be licensed under article 5 of chapter 65 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
8 and amendments thereto; any other suitable person; a shelter facility; a
9 youth residential facility; a staff secure facility, notwithstanding any other
10 provision of law, if the child has been subjected to human trafficking or
11 aggravated human trafficking, as defined by K.S.A. 21-5426, and
12 amendments thereto, or commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as
13 defined by K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments thereto, or the child
14 committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a
15 violation of K.S.A. 21-6419, and amendments thereto; or, if the child is 15
16 years of age or younger, or 16 or 17 years of age if the child has no
17 identifiable parental or family resources or shows signs of physical,
18 mental, emotional or sexual abuse, to the secretary. Custody awarded
19 under this subsection shall continue until further order of the court.
20 (1) When custody is awarded to the secretary, the secretary shall
21 consider any placement recommendation by the court and notify the court
22 of the placement or proposed placement of the child within 10 days of the
23 order awarding custody. After providing the parties or interested parties
24 notice and opportunity to be heard, the court may determine whether the
25 secretary's placement or proposed placement is contrary to the welfare or
26 in the best interests of the child. In making that determination the court
27 shall consider the health and safety needs of the child and the resources
28 available to meet the needs of children in the custody of the secretary. If
29 the court determines that the placement or proposed placement is contrary
30 to the welfare or not in the best interests of the child, the court shall notify
31 the secretary, who shall then make an alternative placement.
32 (2) The custodian designated under this subsection shall notify the
33 court in writing at least 10 days prior to any planned placement with a
34 parent. The written notice shall state the basis for the custodian's belief that
35 placement with a parent is no longer contrary to the welfare or best interest
36 of the child. Upon reviewing the notice, the court may allow the custodian
37 to proceed with the planned placement or may set the date for a hearing to
38 determine if the child shall be allowed to return home. If the court sets a
39 hearing on the matter, the custodian shall not return the child home without
40 written consent of the court.
41 (3) The court may grant any person reasonable rights to visit the child
42 upon motion of the person and a finding that the visitation rights would be
43 in the best interests of the child.
SB 245 59
1 (4) The court may enter an order restraining any alleged perpetrator
2 of physical, mental or emotional abuse or sexual abuse of the child from:
3 Residing in the child's home; visiting, contacting, harassing or intimidating
4 the child, other family member or witness; or attempting to visit, contact,
5 harass or intimidate the child, other family member or witness. Such
6 restraining order shall be served by personal service pursuant to K.S.A.
7 38-2237(a), and amendments thereto, on any alleged perpetrator to whom
8 the order is directed.
9 (5) The court shall provide a copy of any orders entered within 10
10 days of entering the order to the custodian designated under this
11 subsection.
12 (e) Further determinations regarding a child removed from the home.
13 If custody has been awarded under subsection (d) to a person other than a
14 parent, a permanency plan shall be provided or prepared pursuant to
15 K.S.A. 38-2264, and amendments thereto. If a permanency plan is
16 provided at the dispositional hearing, the court may determine whether
17 reintegration is a viable alternative or, if reintegration is not a viable
18 alternative, whether the child should be placed for adoption, a permanent
19 custodian appointed or a SOUL family legal permanency custodian
20 appointed. In determining whether reintegration is a viable alternative, the
21 court shall consider:
22 (1) Whether a parent has been found by a court to have committed
23 one of the following crimes or to have violated the law of another state
24 prohibiting such crimes or to have aided and abetted, attempted, conspired
25 or solicited the commission of one of these crimes:
26 (A) Capital murder, K.S.A. 21-3439 or 21-5401, prior to their repeal;
27 (B) aggravated murder, section 2, and amendments thereto;
28 (C) murder in the first degree, K.S.A. 21-3401, prior to its repeal, or
29 K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments thereto;
30 (B)(D) murder in the second degree, K.S.A. 21-3402, prior to its
31 repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto;
32 (C) capital murder, K.S.A. 21-3439, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-
33 5401, and amendments thereto;
34 (D)(E) voluntary manslaughter, K.S.A. 21-3403, prior to its repeal, or
35 K.S.A. 21-5404, and amendments thereto; or
36 (E)(F) a felony battery that resulted in bodily injury;
37 (2) whether a parent has subjected the child or another child to
38 aggravated circumstances;
39 (3) whether a parent has previously been found to be an unfit parent
40 in proceedings under this code or in comparable proceedings under the
41 laws of another state or the federal government;
42 (4) whether the child has been in the custody of the secretary and
43 placed with neither parent for 15 of the most recent 22 months beginning
SB 245 60
1 60 days after the date on which when a child in the secretary's custody was
2 removed from the child's home;
3 (5) whether the parents have failed to work diligently toward
4 reintegration;
5 (6) whether the secretary has provided the family with services
6 necessary for the safe return of the child to the home; and
7 (7) whether it is reasonable to expect reintegration to occur within a
8 time frame consistent with the child's developmental needs.
9 (f) Proceedings if reintegration is not a viable alternative. If the court
10 determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative, proceedings to
11 terminate parental rights and permit placement of the child for adoption or
12 appointment of a permanent custodian or a SOUL family legal
13 permanency custodian shall be initiated unless the court finds that
14 compelling reasons have been documented in the case plan why adoption
15 or appointment of a permanent custodian or a SOUL family legal
16 permanency custodian would not be in the best interests of the child. If
17 compelling reasons have not been documented, the county or district
18 attorney shall file a motion within 30 days to terminate parental rights or a
19 motion to appoint a permanent custodian or SOUL family legal
20 permanency custodian pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2272a, and
21 amendments thereto, within 30 days and the court shall hold a hearing on
22 the motion within 90 days of its filing. No hearing is required when the
23 parents voluntarily relinquish parental rights or consent to the appointment
24 of a permanent custodian or a SOUL family legal permanency custodian.
25 (g) Additional orders. In addition to or in lieu of any other order
26 authorized by this section:
27 (1) The court may order the child and the parents of any child who
28 has been adjudicated a child in need of care to attend counseling sessions
29 as the court directs. The expense of the counseling may be assessed as an
30 expense in the case. No mental health provider shall charge a greater fee
31 for court-ordered counseling than the provider would have charged to the
32 person receiving counseling if the person had requested counseling on the
33 person's own initiative.
34 (2) If the court has reason to believe that a child is before the court
35 due, in whole or in part, to the use or misuse of alcohol or a violation of
36 K.S.A. 21-5701 through 21-5717, and amendments thereto, by the child, a
37 parent of the child, or another person responsible for the care of the child,
38 the court may order the child, parent of the child or other person
39 responsible for the care of the child to submit to and complete an alcohol
40 and drug evaluation by a qualified person or agency and comply with any
41 recommendations. If the evaluation is performed by a community-based
42 alcohol and drug safety program certified pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1008, and
43 amendments thereto, the child, parent of the child or other person
SB 245 61
1 responsible for the care of the child shall pay a fee not to exceed the fee
2 established by that statute. If the court finds that the child and those legally
3 liable for the child's support are indigent, the fee may be waived. In no
4 event shall the fee be assessed against the secretary.
5 (3) If child support has been requested and the parent or parents have
6 a duty to support the child, the court may order one or both parents to pay
7 child support and, when custody is awarded to the secretary, the court shall
8 order one or both parents to pay child support. The court shall determine,
9 for each parent separately, whether the parent is already subject to an order
10 to pay support for the child. If the parent is not presently ordered to pay
11 support for any child who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court and the
12 court has personal jurisdiction over the parent, the court shall order the
13 parent to pay child support in an amount determined under K.S.A. 38-
14 2277, and amendments thereto. Except for good cause shown, the court
15 shall issue an immediate income withholding order pursuant to K.S.A. 23-
16 3101 et seq., and amendments thereto, for each parent ordered to pay
17 support under this subsection, regardless of whether a payor has been
18 identified for the parent. A parent ordered to pay child support under this
19 subsection shall be notified, at the hearing or otherwise, that the child
20 support order may be registered pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2279, and
21 amendments thereto. The parent shall also be informed that, after
22 registration, the income withholding order may be served on the parent's
23 employer without further notice to the parent and the child support order
24 may be enforced by any method allowed by law. Failure to provide this
25 notice shall not affect the validity of the child support order.
26 (h) For the purposes of this section, "harassing or intimidating" and
27 "harass or intimidate" includes, but is not limited to, utilizing any
28 electronic tracking system or acquiring tracking information to determine
29 the targeted person's location, movement or travel patterns.

31 2271. (a) It is presumed in the manner provided in K.S.A. 60-414, and

33 2365. (a) When a juvenile offender has been placed in the custody of the
34 secretary, the secretary shall have a reasonable time to make a placement.
35 If the juvenile offender has not been placed, any party who believes that
36 the amount of time elapsed without placement has exceeded a reasonable
37 time may file a motion for review with the court. In determining what is a
38 reasonable amount of time, matters considered by the court shall include,
39 but not be limited to, the nature of the underlying offense, efforts made for
40 placement of the juvenile offender and the availability of a suitable
41 placement. The secretary shall notify the court, the juvenile's attorney of
42 record and the juvenile's parent, in writing, of the initial placement and any
43 subsequent change of placement as soon as the placement has been
SB 245 69
1 accomplished. The notice to the juvenile offender's parent shall be sent to
2 such parent's last known address or addresses. The court shall have no
3 power to direct a specific placement by the secretary, but may make
4 recommendations to the secretary. The secretary may place the juvenile
5 offender in an institution operated by the secretary, a youth residential
6 facility or any other appropriate placement. If the court has recommended
7 an out-of-home placement, the secretary may not return the juvenile
8 offender to the home from which removed without first notifying the court
9 of the plan.
10 (b) If a juvenile is in the custody of the secretary, the secretary shall
11 prepare and present a permanency plan at sentencing or within 30 days
12 thereafter. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older and the juvenile is
13 able, the secretary shall prepare the permanency plan in consultation with
14 the juvenile. If a permanency plan is already in place under a child in need
15 of care proceeding, the court may adopt the plan under the present
16 proceeding. The written permanency plan shall provide for reintegration of
17 the juvenile into such juvenile's family or, if reintegration is not a viable
18 alternative, for other permanent placement of the juvenile. Reintegration
19 may not be a viable alternative when:
20 (1) The parent has been found by a court to have committed capital
21 murder, K.S.A. 21-3439 or 21-5401, prior to their repeal, aggravated
22 murder, section 2, and amendments thereto, murder in the first degree,
23 K.S.A. 21-3401, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments
24 thereto, murder in the second degree, K.S.A. 21-3402, prior to its repeal,

27 voluntary manslaughter, K.S.A. 21-3403, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-
28 5404, and amendments thereto, of a child or violated a law of another state
29 which that prohibits such murder or manslaughter of a child;
30 (2) the parent aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to
31 commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter of a child;
32 (3) the parent committed a felony battery that resulted in bodily
33 injury to the juvenile who is the subject of this proceeding or another
34 child;
35 (4) the parent has subjected the juvenile who is the subject of this
36 proceeding or another child to aggravated circumstances as defined in
37 K.S.A. 38-1502, and amendments thereto;
38 (5) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been
39 terminated involuntarily; or
40 (6) the juvenile has been in extended out-of-home placement as
41 defined in K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto.
42 (c) If the juvenile is placed in the custody of the secretary, the plan
43 shall be prepared and submitted by the secretary. If the juvenile is placed
SB 245 70
1 in the custody of a facility or person other than the secretary, the plan shall
2 be prepared and submitted by a court services officer. If the permanency
3 goal is reintegration into the family, the permanency plan shall include
4 measurable objectives and time schedules for reintegration.
5 (d) During the time a juvenile remains in the custody of the secretary,
6 the secretary shall submit to the court, at least every six months, a written
7 report of the progress being made toward the goals of the permanency plan
8 submitted pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and the specific actions taken
9 to achieve the goals of the permanency plan. If the juvenile is placed in
10 foster care, the court may request the foster parent to submit to the court,
11 at least every six months, a report in regard to the juvenile's adjustment,
12 progress and condition. Such report shall be made a part of the juvenile's
13 court social file. The court shall review the plan submitted by the secretary
14 and the report, if any, submitted by the foster parent and determine
15 whether reasonable efforts and progress have been made to achieve the
16 goals of the permanency plan. If the court determines that progress is
17 inadequate or that the permanency plan is no longer viable, the court shall
18 hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (e).
19 (e) When the secretary has custody of the juvenile, a permanency
20 hearing shall be held no more than 12 months after the juvenile is first
21 placed outside such juvenile's home and at least every 12 months
22 thereafter. Juvenile offenders who have been in extended out-of-home
23 placement shall be provided a permanency hearing within 30 days of a
24 request from the secretary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
25 represent the juvenile offender at the permanency hearing. At the
26 permanency hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable,
27 when the juvenile will be:
28 (1) Reintegrated with the juvenile's parents;
29 (2) placed for adoption;
30 (3) placed with a permanent custodian; or
31 (4) if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and the secretary has
32 documented compelling reasons why it would not be in the juvenile's best
33 interests for a placement in one of the placements pursuant to paragraphs
34 paragraph (1), (2) or (3), placed in another planned permanent
35 arrangement.
36 (f) At each permanency hearing, the court shall:
37 (1) Make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been
38 made to accomplish the permanency goal and whether continued out-of-
39 home placement is necessary for the juvenile's safety;
40 (2) make a written finding as to whether the reasonable and prudent
41 parenting standard has been met and whether the juvenile has regular,
42 ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
43 activities. The secretary shall report to the court the steps the secretary is
SB 245 71
1 taking to ensure that the reasonable and prudent parenting standard is
2 being met and that the juvenile has regular, ongoing opportunities to
3 engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including
4 consultation with the juvenile in an age-appropriate manner about the
5 opportunities of the juvenile to participate in the activities; and
6 (3) if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, document the efforts
7 made by the secretary to help the juvenile prepare for the transition from
8 custody to a successful adulthood. The secretary shall report to the court
9 the programs and services that are being provided to the juvenile which
10 that will help the juvenile prepare for the transition from custody to a
11 successful adulthood.
12 (g) The requirements of this subsection shall apply only if the
13 permanency goal in place at the time of the hearing is another planned
14 permanent arrangement as described in subsection (e)(4). At each
15 permanency hearing held with respect to the juvenile, in addition to the
16 requirements of subsection (f), the court shall:
17 (1) Ask the juvenile, if the juvenile is able, by attendance at the
18 hearing or by report to the court, about the desired permanency outcome
19 for the juvenile;
20 (2) document the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
21 unsuccessful permanency efforts made by the secretary to return the
22 juvenile home or secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing
23 relative, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent. The secretary shall report
24 to the court the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
25 unsuccessful efforts made by the secretary to return the juvenile home or
26 secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing relative, a legal
27 guardian or an adoptive parent, including efforts that utilize search
28 technology, including social media, to find biological family members of
29 the children; and
30 (3) make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of
31 the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
32 permanency plan for the juvenile and provide compelling reasons why it
33 continues to not be in the best interests of the juvenile to return home, be
34 placed for adoption, be placed with a legal guardian or be placed with a fit
35 and willing relative.
36 (h) Whenever a hearing is required under subsection (e), the court
37 shall notify all interested parties of the hearing date, the secretary, foster
38 parent and preadoptive parent or relatives providing care for the juvenile
39 and hold a hearing. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, the court
40 shall require notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing be
41 given to the juvenile. Such notice shall request the juvenile's participation
42 in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. Individuals receiving
43 notice pursuant to this subsection shall not be made a party to the action
SB 245 72
1 solely on the basis of this notice and opportunity to be heard. After
2 providing the persons receiving notice an opportunity to be heard, the
3 court shall determine whether the juvenile's needs are being adequately
4 met; whether services set out in the permanency plan necessary for the
5 safe return of the juvenile have been made available to the parent with
6 whom reintegration is planned; and whether reasonable efforts and
7 progress have been made to achieve the goals of the permanency plan.
8 (i) If the court finds reintegration continues to be a viable alternative,
9 the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the juvenile will
10 be returned to the parent. The court may rescind any of its prior
11 dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized by this
12 code or may order that a new plan for the reintegration be prepared and
13 submitted to the court. If reintegration cannot be accomplished as
14 approved by the court, the court shall be informed and shall schedule a
15 hearing pursuant to subsection (j). No such hearing is required when the
16 parent voluntarily relinquishes parental rights or agrees to appointment of
17 a permanent guardian.
18 (j) When the court finds any of the following conditions exist, the
19 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee shall
20 file a petition alleging the juvenile to be a child in need of care and
21 requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to the Kansas code for
22 care of children:
23 (1) The court determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative
24 and either adoption or permanent guardianship might be in the best
25 interests of the juvenile;
26 (2) the goal of the permanency plan is reintegration into the family
27 and the court determines after 12 months from the time such plan is first
28 submitted that progress is inadequate; or
29 (3) the juvenile has been in out-of-home placement for a cumulative
30 total of 15 of the last 22 months, excluding trial home visits and juvenile in
31 runaway status.
32 Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit termination of
33 parental rights prior to the expiration of 12 months.
34 (k) A petition to terminate parental rights is not required to be filed if
35 one of the following exceptions is documented to exist:
36 (1) The juvenile is in a stable placement with relatives;
37 (2) services set out in the case plan necessary for the safe return of
38 the juvenile have not been made available to the parent with whom
39 reintegration is planned; or
40 (3) there are one or more documented reasons why such filing would
41 not be in the best interests of the juvenile. Documented reasons may
42 include, but are not limited to: The juvenile has close emotional bonds
43 with a parent which that should not be broken; the juvenile is 14 years of
SB 245 73
1 age or older and, after advice and counsel, refuses to be adopted;
2 insufficient grounds exist for termination of parental rights; the juvenile is
3 an unaccompanied refugee minor; or there are international legal or
4 compelling foreign policy reasons precluding termination of parental
5 rights.

21 crime as defined in this section.
22 (6) As used in this subsection, "sexually motivated" means that one of
23 the purposes for which the defendant committed the crime was for the
24 purpose of the defendant's sexual gratification.
25 (e) If an inmate is sentenced to imprisonment for a crime committed
26 while on parole or conditional release, the inmate shall be eligible for
27 parole as provided by subsection (c), except that the prisoner review board
28 may postpone the inmate's parole eligibility date by assessing a penalty not
29 exceeding the period of time which that could have been assessed if the
30 inmate's parole or conditional release had been violated for reasons other
31 than conviction of a crime.
32 (f) If a person is sentenced to prison for a crime committed on or after
33 July 1, 1993, while on probation, parole, conditional release or in a
34 community corrections program, for a crime committed prior to July 1,
35 1993, and the person is not eligible for retroactive application of the
36 sentencing guidelines and amendments thereto pursuant to K.S.A. 21-
37 4724, prior to its repeal, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the
38 old sentence, but shall begin when the person is paroled or reaches the
39 conditional release date on the old sentence. If the offender was past the
40 offender's conditional release date at the time the new offense was
41 committed, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the old sentence
42 but shall begin when the person is ordered released by the prisoner review
43 board or reaches the maximum sentence expiration date on the old

SB 245 38
1 sentence, whichever is earlier. The new sentence shall then be served as
2 otherwise provided by law. The period of postrelease supervision shall be
3 based on the new sentence, except that those offenders whose old sentence
4 is a term of imprisonment for life, imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 1993 Supp.
5 21-4628, prior to its repeal, or an indeterminate sentence with a maximum
6 term of life imprisonment, for which there is no conditional release or
7 maximum sentence expiration date, shall remain on postrelease
8 supervision for life or until discharged from supervision by the prisoner
9 review board.
10 (g) Subject to the provisions of this section, the prisoner review board
11 may release on parole those persons confined in institutions who are
12 eligible for parole when: (1) The board believes that the inmate should be
13 released for hospitalization, deportation or to answer the warrant or other
14 process of a court and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability
15 that the inmate can be released without detriment to the community or to
16 the inmate; or (2) the secretary of corrections has reported to the board in
17 writing that the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required
18 by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments
19 thereto, or any revision of such agreement, and the board believes that the
20 inmate is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law abiding citizen
21 and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability that the inmate
22 can be released without detriment to the community or to the inmate.
23 Parole shall not be granted as an award of clemency and shall not be
24 considered a reduction of sentence or a pardon.
25 (h) The prisoner review board shall hold a parole hearing at least the
26 month prior to the month an inmate will be eligible for parole under
27 subsections (a), (b) and (c). At least one month preceding the parole
28 hearing, the county or district attorney of the county where the inmate was
29 convicted shall give written notice of the time and place of the public
30 comment sessions for the inmate to any victim of the inmate's crime who
31 is alive and whose address is known to the county or district attorney or, if
32 the victim is deceased, to the victim's family if the family's address is
33 known to the county or district attorney. Except as otherwise provided,
34 failure to notify pursuant to this section shall not be a reason to postpone a
35 parole hearing. In the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
36 a class A felony, the secretary of corrections shall give written notice of the
37 time and place of the public comment session for such inmate at least one
38 month preceding the public comment session to any victim of such
39 inmate's crime or the victim's family pursuant to K.S.A. 74-7338, and
40 amendments thereto. If notification is not given to such victim or such
41 victim's family in the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
42 a class A felony, the board shall postpone a decision on parole of the
43 inmate to a time at least 30 days after notification is given as provided in

SB 245 39
1 this section. Nothing in this section shall create a cause of action against
2 the state or an employee of the state acting within the scope of the
3 employee's employment as a result of the failure to notify pursuant to this
4 section. If granted parole, the inmate may be released on parole on the date
5 specified by the board, but not earlier than the date the inmate is eligible
6 for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At each parole hearing and, if
7 parole is not granted, at such intervals thereafter as it determines
8 appropriate, the board shall consider: (1) Whether the inmate has
9 satisfactorily completed the programs required by any agreement entered
10 under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, or any revision of such
11 agreement; and (2) all pertinent information regarding such inmate,
12 including, but not limited to, the circumstances of the offense of the
13 inmate; the presentence report; the previous social history and criminal
14 record of the inmate; the conduct, employment, and attitude of the inmate
15 in prison; the reports of such physical and mental examinations as have
16 been made, including, but not limited to, risk factors revealed by any risk
17 assessment of the inmate; comments of the victim and the victim's family
18 including in person comments, contemporaneous comments and
19 prerecorded comments made by any technological means; comments of
20 the public; official comments; any recommendation by the staff of the
21 facility where the inmate is incarcerated; proportionality of the time the
22 inmate has served to the sentence a person would receive under the Kansas
23 sentencing guidelines for the conduct that resulted in the inmate's
24 incarceration; and capacity of state correctional institutions.
25 (i) In those cases involving inmates sentenced for a crime committed
26 after July 1, 1993, the prisoner review board will review the inmate's
27 proposed release plan. The board may schedule a hearing if they desire.
28 The board may impose any condition they deem necessary to insure public
29 safety, aid in the reintegration of the inmate into the community, or items
30 not completed under the agreement entered into under K.S.A. 75-5210a,
31 and amendments thereto. The board may not advance or delay an inmate's
32 release date. Every inmate while on postrelease supervision shall remain in
33 the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders
34 of the secretary.
35 (j) (1) Before ordering the parole of any inmate, the prisoner review
36 board shall have the inmate appear either in person or via a video
37 conferencing format and shall interview the inmate unless impractical
38 because of the inmate's physical or mental condition or absence from the
39 institution. Every inmate while on parole shall remain in the legal custody
40 of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary.
41 Whenever the board formally considers placing an inmate on parole and
42 no agreement has been entered into with the inmate under K.S.A. 75-
43 5210a, and amendments thereto, the board shall notify the inmate in

SB 245 40
1 writing of the reasons for not granting parole. If an agreement has been
2 entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the inmate
3 has not satisfactorily completed the programs specified in the agreement,
4 or any revision of such agreement, the board shall notify the inmate in
5 writing of the specific programs the inmate must satisfactorily complete
6 before parole will be granted. If parole is not granted only because of a
7 failure to satisfactorily complete such programs, the board shall grant
8 parole upon the secretary's certification that the inmate has successfully
9 completed such programs. If an agreement has been entered under K.S.A.
10 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the secretary of corrections has
11 reported to the board in writing that the inmate has satisfactorily
12 completed the programs required by such agreement, or any revision
13 thereof, the board shall not require further program participation.
14 However, if the board determines that other pertinent information
15 regarding the inmate warrants the inmate's not being released on parole,
16 the board shall state in writing the reasons for not granting the parole. If
17 parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a crime other than a class A or
18 class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole
19 hearing for the inmate not later than one year after the denial unless the
20 board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted
21 at a hearing if held in the next three years or during the interim period of a
22 deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for
23 up to three years but any such deferral by the board shall require the board
24 to state the basis for its findings. If parole is denied for an inmate
25 sentenced for a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board
26 shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than three years
27 after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect
28 that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next 10 years or
29 during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer
30 subsequent parole hearings for up to 10 years, but any such deferral shall
31 require the board to state the basis for its findings.
32 (2) Inmates sentenced for a class A or class B felony who have not
33 had a board hearing in the five years prior to July 1, 2010, shall have such
34 inmates' cases reviewed by the board on or before July 1, 2012. Such
35 review shall begin with the inmates with the oldest deferral date and
36 progress to the most recent. Such review shall be done utilizing existing
37 resources unless the board determines that such resources are insufficient.
38 If the board determines that such resources are insufficient, then the
39 provisions of this paragraph are subject to appropriations therefor.
40 (k) (1) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision shall be
41 assigned, upon release, to the appropriate level of supervision pursuant to
42 the criteria established by the secretary of corrections.
43 (2) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall

SB 245 41
1 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
2 effects, vehicle, residence and property by a parole officer or a department
3 of corrections enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any
4 time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or
5 without cause. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize
6 such officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the
7 sole purpose of harassment.
8 (3) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
9 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
10 effects, vehicle, residence and property by any law enforcement officer
11 based on reasonable suspicion of the person violating conditions of parole
12 or postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Any
13 law enforcement officer who conducts such a search shall submit a written
14 report to the appropriate parole officer no later than the close of the next
15 business day after such search. The written report shall include the facts
16 leading to such search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting
17 from such search.
18 (l) The prisoner review board shall promulgate rules and regulations
19 in accordance with K.S.A. 77-415 et seq., and amendments thereto, not
20 inconsistent with the law and as it may deem proper or necessary, with
21 respect to the conduct of parole hearings, postrelease supervision reviews,
22 revocation hearings, orders of restitution, reimbursement of expenditures
23 by the state board of indigents' defense services and other conditions to be
24 imposed upon parolees or releasees. Whenever an order for parole or
25 postrelease supervision is issued it shall recite the conditions thereof.
26 (m) Whenever the prisoner review board orders the parole of an
27 inmate or establishes conditions for an inmate placed on postrelease
28 supervision, the board shall require that the inmate:
29 (1) Obey all laws and ordinances and report any law enforcement
30 contact to the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after such
31 contact;
32 (2) not engage in physical violence or threats of violence of any kind
33 and, if the inmate is being supervised for conviction of a felony, not
34 purchase or possess a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, while on
35 supervision;
36 (3) report to the inmate's supervision officer as directed and be
37 truthful in all matters;
38 (4) remain within the state of Kansas or other specified areas as
39 defined by the defendant's supervision officer;
40 (5) reside at the inmate's approved residence unless the defendant
41 receives permission from the inmate's supervision officer to relocate and
42 notify the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after any emergency
43 changes in residence or contact information;

SB 245 42
1 (6) not possess, use or distribute any controlled substances except
2 those prescribed by a licensed medical professional;
3 (7) not possess or consume any form of alcohol or intoxicating
4 substance or enter any establishment where alcohol is sold or consumed as
5 the primary business;
6 (8) submit to any form of alcohol or substance use testing directed by
7 the inmate's supervision officer and not alter or tamper with the specimen
8 or test;
9 (9) participate in assessment, treatment, programming and other
10 directives of the court or the inmate's supervision officer;
11 (10) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
12 residence and property by a parole officer or a department of corrections
13 enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any time of the day
14 or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause,
15 except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize such
16 officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the sole
17 purpose of harassment;
18 (11) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
19 residence and property by any law enforcement officer based on

22 (12) refrain from contacting victims unless authorized by the board to
23 contact a victim as part of rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes;
24 (13) pay the administrative fee imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4529,
25 and amendments thereto, unless the board finds compelling circumstances
26 that would render payment unworkable; and
27 (14) unless the board finds compelling circumstances that would
28 render a plan of payment unworkable, reimburse the state for all or part of
29 the expenditures by the state board of indigents' defense services to
30 provide counsel and other defense services to the person. In determining
31 the amount and method of payment of such sum, the prisoner review board
32 shall take account of the financial resources of the person and the nature of
33 the burden that the payment of such sum will impose. Such amount shall
34 not exceed the amount claimed by appointed counsel on the payment
35 voucher for indigents' defense services or the amount prescribed by the
36 board of indigents' defense services reimbursement tables as provided in
37 K.S.A. 22-4522, and amendments thereto, whichever is less, minus any
38 previous payments for such services.
39 (n) Any law enforcement officer who conducts a search pursuant to
40 subsection (m)(11) shall submit a written report to the inmate's parole
41 officer not later than the close of business the next day after such search is
42 conducted. The written report shall include the facts leading to such
43 search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting from such

SB 245 43
1 search.
2 (o) If the court that sentenced an inmate specified at the time of
3 sentencing the amount and the recipient of any restitution ordered as a
4 condition of parole or postrelease supervision, the prisoner review board
5 shall order as a condition of parole or postrelease supervision that the

43 shall forward a copy of such court order to the Kansas bureau of

SB 245 55
1 investigation.
2 If such offender violates a condition of release during the term of the
3 conditional release, the court may require such offender to register
4 pursuant to paragraph (1) subsection (f).
5 (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, for an
6 offender 14 years of age or more who is adjudicated as a juvenile offender
7 for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a sexually
8 violent crime set forth in K.S.A. 22-4902(c), and amendments thereto, and
9 such crime is not an off-grid felony or a felony ranked in severity level 1
10 of the nondrug grid as provided in K.S.A. 21-4704, prior to its repeal, or
11 K.S.A. 21-6804, and amendments thereto, the court shall:
12 (1) Require registration until such offender reaches 18 years of age, at
13 the expiration of five years from the date of adjudication or, if confined,

16 facility or correctional facility or during which when the offender does not
17 comply with any and all requirements of the Kansas offender registration
18 act shall not count toward the duration of registration;

26 agency at the time of registration. The registering law enforcement agency

28 investigation.
29 If such offender violates a condition of release during the term of the
30 conditional release, the court may require such offender to register
31 pursuant to paragraph (1) subsection (g).
32 (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, an offender
33 14 or more years of age or more who is adjudicated as a juvenile offender
34 for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a sexually
35 violent crime set forth in K.S.A. 22-4902(c), and amendments thereto, and
36 such crime is an off-grid felony or a felony ranked in severity level 1 of
37 the nondrug grid as provided in K.S.A. 21-4704, prior to its repeal, or
38 K.S.A. 21-6804, and amendments thereto, shall be required to register for
39 such offender's lifetime.
40 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a diversionary
41 agreement or probation order, either adult or juvenile, or a juvenile
42 offender sentencing order, requires registration under the Kansas offender
43 registration act for an offense that would not otherwise require registration

SB 245 56
1 as provided in K.S.A. 22-4902(a)(5), and amendments thereto, then all
2 provisions of the Kansas offender registration act shall apply, except that
3 the duration of registration shall be controlled by such diversionary
4 agreement, probation order or juvenile offender sentencing order.
5 (j) The duration of registration does not terminate if the convicted or
6 adjudicated offender again becomes liable to register as provided by the
7 Kansas offender registration act during the required period of registration.
8 (k) For any person moving to Kansas who has been convicted or

10 an out-of-state law, the duration of registration shall be the length of time
11 required by the out-of-state jurisdiction or by the Kansas offender
12 registration act, whichever length of time is longer. The provisions of this
13 subsection shall apply to convictions or adjudications prior to June 1,
14 2006, and to persons who moved to Kansas prior to June l, 2006, and to
15 convictions or adjudications on or after June 1, 2006, and to persons who
16 moved to Kansas on or after June l, 2006.
17 (l) For any person residing, maintaining employment or attending
18 school in this state who has been convicted or adjudicated by an out-of-
19 state court of an offense that is comparable to any crime requiring
20 registration pursuant to the Kansas offender registration act, but who was
21 not required to register in the jurisdiction of conviction or adjudication, the
22 duration of registration shall be the duration required for the comparable
23 offense pursuant to the Kansas offender registration act.
24 Sec. 19. K.S.A. 23-3222 is hereby amended to read as follows: 23-
25 3222. (a) Except as provided in subsection (d), a parent entitled to legal
26 custody or residency of or parenting time with a child under this article
27 shall give written notice to the other parent not less than 30 days prior to:
28 (1) Changing the residence of the child; or (2) removing the child from this
29 state for a period of time exceeding 90 days. Such notice shall be sent by
30 restricted mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the
31 other parent.
32 (b) Failure to give notice as required by subsection (a) is an indirect
33 civil contempt punishable as provided by law. In addition, the court may
34 assess, against the parent required to give notice, reasonable attorney fees
35 and any other expenses incurred by the other parent by reason of the
36 failure to give notice.
37 (c) A change of the residence or the removal of a child as described in
38 subsection (a) may be considered a material change of circumstances
39 which justifies modification of a prior order of legal custody, residency,
40 child support or parenting time. In determining any motion seeking a
41 modification of a prior order based on change of residence or removal as
42 described in (a), the court shall consider all factors the court deems
43 appropriate including, but not limited to: (1) The effect of the move on the

SB 245 57
1 best interests of the child; (2) the effect of the move on any party having
2 rights granted under this article; and (3) the increased cost the move will
3 impose on any party seeking to exercise rights granted under this article.
4 (d) A parent entitled to the legal custody or residency of a child under
5 this article shall not be required to give the notice required by this section
6 to the other parent when the other parent has been convicted of any crime
7 specified in article 34, 35 or 36 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes
8 Annotated, or K.S.A. 21-5401, prior to their repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5401 21-
9 5402 through 21-5609, section 2, 21-6104, 21-6325, 21-6326 or 21-6419
10 through 21-6422, and amendments thereto, in which the child is the victim
11 of such crime.
12 Sec. 20. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2255 is hereby amended to read as
13 follows: 38-2255. (a) Considerations. Prior to entering an order of
14 disposition, the court shall give consideration to:
15 (1) The child's physical, mental and emotional condition;
16 (2) the child's need for assistance;
17 (3) the manner in which the parent participated in the abuse, neglect
18 or abandonment of the child;
19 (4) any relevant information from the intake and assessment process;
20 and
21 (5) the evidence received at the dispositional hearing.
22 (b) Custody with a parent. The court may place the child in the
23 custody of either of the child's parents subject to terms and conditions
24 which the court prescribes to assure the proper care and protection of the
25 child, including, but not limited to:
26 (1) Supervision of the child and the parent by a court services officer;
27 (2) participation by the child and the parent in available programs
28 operated by an appropriate individual or agency; and
29 (3) any special treatment or care which the child needs for the child's
30 physical, mental or emotional health and safety.
31 (c) Removal of a child from custody of a parent. The court shall not
32 enter the initial order removing a child from the custody of a parent
33 pursuant to this section unless the court first finds probable cause that:
34 (1) (A) The child is likely to sustain harm if not immediately removed
35 from the home;
36 (B) allowing the child to remain in home is contrary to the welfare of
37 the child; or
38 (C) immediate placement of the child is in the best interest of the
39 child; and
40 (2) reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the family unit and
41 prevent the unnecessary removal of the child from the child's home or that
42 an emergency exists that threatens the safety to the child.
43 The court shall not enter an order removing a child from the custody of

SB 245 58
1 a parent pursuant to this section based solely on the finding that the parent
2 is homeless.
3 (d) Custody of a child removed from the custody of a parent. If the
4 court has made the findings required by subsection (c), the court shall
5 enter an order awarding custody to: A relative of the child or to a person
6 with whom the child has close emotional ties who shall not be required to
7 be licensed under article 5 of chapter 65 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
8 and amendments thereto; any other suitable person; a shelter facility; a
9 youth residential facility; a staff secure facility, notwithstanding any other
10 provision of law, if the child has been subjected to human trafficking or
11 aggravated human trafficking, as defined by K.S.A. 21-5426, and
12 amendments thereto, or commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as
13 defined by K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments thereto, or the child
14 committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a
15 violation of K.S.A. 21-6419, and amendments thereto; or, if the child is 15
16 years of age or younger, or 16 or 17 years of age if the child has no
17 identifiable parental or family resources or shows signs of physical,
18 mental, emotional or sexual abuse, to the secretary. Custody awarded
19 under this subsection shall continue until further order of the court.
20 (1) When custody is awarded to the secretary, the secretary shall
21 consider any placement recommendation by the court and notify the court
22 of the placement or proposed placement of the child within 10 days of the
23 order awarding custody. After providing the parties or interested parties
24 notice and opportunity to be heard, the court may determine whether the
25 secretary's placement or proposed placement is contrary to the welfare or
26 in the best interests of the child. In making that determination the court
27 shall consider the health and safety needs of the child and the resources
28 available to meet the needs of children in the custody of the secretary. If
29 the court determines that the placement or proposed placement is contrary
30 to the welfare or not in the best interests of the child, the court shall notify
31 the secretary, who shall then make an alternative placement.
32 (2) The custodian designated under this subsection shall notify the
33 court in writing at least 10 days prior to any planned placement with a
34 parent. The written notice shall state the basis for the custodian's belief that
35 placement with a parent is no longer contrary to the welfare or best interest
36 of the child. Upon reviewing the notice, the court may allow the custodian
37 to proceed with the planned placement or may set the date for a hearing to
38 determine if the child shall be allowed to return home. If the court sets a
39 hearing on the matter, the custodian shall not return the child home without
40 written consent of the court.
41 (3) The court may grant any person reasonable rights to visit the child
42 upon motion of the person and a finding that the visitation rights would be
43 in the best interests of the child.

SB 245 59
1 (4) The court may enter an order restraining any alleged perpetrator
2 of physical, mental or emotional abuse or sexual abuse of the child from:
3 Residing in the child's home; visiting, contacting, harassing or intimidating
4 the child, other family member or witness; or attempting to visit, contact,
5 harass or intimidate the child, other family member or witness. Such
6 restraining order shall be served by personal service pursuant to K.S.A.
7 38-2237(a), and amendments thereto, on any alleged perpetrator to whom
8 the order is directed.
9 (5) The court shall provide a copy of any orders entered within 10
10 days of entering the order to the custodian designated under this
11 subsection.
12 (e) Further determinations regarding a child removed from the home.
13 If custody has been awarded under subsection (d) to a person other than a
14 parent, a permanency plan shall be provided or prepared pursuant to
15 K.S.A. 38-2264, and amendments thereto. If a permanency plan is
16 provided at the dispositional hearing, the court may determine whether
17 reintegration is a viable alternative or, if reintegration is not a viable
18 alternative, whether the child should be placed for adoption, a permanent
19 custodian appointed or a SOUL family legal permanency custodian
20 appointed. In determining whether reintegration is a viable alternative, the
21 court shall consider:
22 (1) Whether a parent has been found by a court to have committed
23 one of the following crimes or to have violated the law of another state
24 prohibiting such crimes or to have aided and abetted, attempted, conspired
25 or solicited the commission of one of these crimes:
26 (A) Capital murder, K.S.A. 21-3439 or 21-5401, prior to their repeal;
27 (B) aggravated murder, section 2, and amendments thereto;
28 (C) murder in the first degree, K.S.A. 21-3401, prior to its repeal, or
29 K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments thereto;
30 (B)(D) murder in the second degree, K.S.A. 21-3402, prior to its
31 repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto;
32 (C) capital murder, K.S.A. 21-3439, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-
33 5401, and amendments thereto;
34 (D)(E) voluntary manslaughter, K.S.A. 21-3403, prior to its repeal, or
35 K.S.A. 21-5404, and amendments thereto; or
36 (E)(F) a felony battery that resulted in bodily injury;
37 (2) whether a parent has subjected the child or another child to
38 aggravated circumstances;
39 (3) whether a parent has previously been found to be an unfit parent
40 in proceedings under this code or in comparable proceedings under the
41 laws of another state or the federal government;
42 (4) whether the child has been in the custody of the secretary and
43 placed with neither parent for 15 of the most recent 22 months beginning

SB 245 60
1 60 days after the date on which when a child in the secretary's custody was
2 removed from the child's home;
3 (5) whether the parents have failed to work diligently toward
4 reintegration;
5 (6) whether the secretary has provided the family with services
6 necessary for the safe return of the child to the home; and
7 (7) whether it is reasonable to expect reintegration to occur within a
8 time frame consistent with the child's developmental needs.
9 (f) Proceedings if reintegration is not a viable alternative. If the court
10 determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative, proceedings to
11 terminate parental rights and permit placement of the child for adoption or
12 appointment of a permanent custodian or a SOUL family legal
13 permanency custodian shall be initiated unless the court finds that
14 compelling reasons have been documented in the case plan why adoption
15 or appointment of a permanent custodian or a SOUL family legal
16 permanency custodian would not be in the best interests of the child. If
17 compelling reasons have not been documented, the county or district
18 attorney shall file a motion within 30 days to terminate parental rights or a
19 motion to appoint a permanent custodian or SOUL family legal
20 permanency custodian pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2272a, and
21 amendments thereto, within 30 days and the court shall hold a hearing on
22 the motion within 90 days of its filing. No hearing is required when the
23 parents voluntarily relinquish parental rights or consent to the appointment
24 of a permanent custodian or a SOUL family legal permanency custodian.
25 (g) Additional orders. In addition to or in lieu of any other order
26 authorized by this section:
27 (1) The court may order the child and the parents of any child who
28 has been adjudicated a child in need of care to attend counseling sessions
29 as the court directs. The expense of the counseling may be assessed as an
30 expense in the case. No mental health provider shall charge a greater fee
31 for court-ordered counseling than the provider would have charged to the
32 person receiving counseling if the person had requested counseling on the
33 person's own initiative.
34 (2) If the court has reason to believe that a child is before the court
35 due, in whole or in part, to the use or misuse of alcohol or a violation of
36 K.S.A. 21-5701 through 21-5717, and amendments thereto, by the child, a
37 parent of the child, or another person responsible for the care of the child,
38 the court may order the child, parent of the child or other person
39 responsible for the care of the child to submit to and complete an alcohol
40 and drug evaluation by a qualified person or agency and comply with any
41 recommendations. If the evaluation is performed by a community-based
42 alcohol and drug safety program certified pursuant to K.S.A. 8-1008, and
43 amendments thereto, the child, parent of the child or other person

SB 245 61
1 responsible for the care of the child shall pay a fee not to exceed the fee
2 established by that statute. If the court finds that the child and those legally
3 liable for the child's support are indigent, the fee may be waived. In no
4 event shall the fee be assessed against the secretary.
5 (3) If child support has been requested and the parent or parents have
6 a duty to support the child, the court may order one or both parents to pay
7 child support and, when custody is awarded to the secretary, the court shall
8 order one or both parents to pay child support. The court shall determine,
9 for each parent separately, whether the parent is already subject to an order
10 to pay support for the child. If the parent is not presently ordered to pay
11 support for any child who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court and the
12 court has personal jurisdiction over the parent, the court shall order the
13 parent to pay child support in an amount determined under K.S.A. 38-
14 2277, and amendments thereto. Except for good cause shown, the court
15 shall issue an immediate income withholding order pursuant to K.S.A. 23-
16 3101 et seq., and amendments thereto, for each parent ordered to pay
17 support under this subsection, regardless of whether a payor has been
18 identified for the parent. A parent ordered to pay child support under this
19 subsection shall be notified, at the hearing or otherwise, that the child
20 support order may be registered pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2279, and
21 amendments thereto. The parent shall also be informed that, after
22 registration, the income withholding order may be served on the parent's
23 employer without further notice to the parent and the child support order
24 may be enforced by any method allowed by law. Failure to provide this
25 notice shall not affect the validity of the child support order.
26 (h) For the purposes of this section, "harassing or intimidating" and
27 "harass or intimidate" includes, but is not limited to, utilizing any
28 electronic tracking system or acquiring tracking information to determine
29 the targeted person's location, movement or travel patterns.

39 but not be limited to, the nature of the underlying offense, efforts made for

SB 245 69
1 accomplished. The notice to the juvenile offender's parent shall be sent to
2 such parent's last known address or addresses. The court shall have no
3 power to direct a specific placement by the secretary, but may make
4 recommendations to the secretary. The secretary may place the juvenile
5 offender in an institution operated by the secretary, a youth residential
6 facility or any other appropriate placement. If the court has recommended
7 an out-of-home placement, the secretary may not return the juvenile
8 offender to the home from which removed without first notifying the court
9 of the plan.
10 (b) If a juvenile is in the custody of the secretary, the secretary shall
11 prepare and present a permanency plan at sentencing or within 30 days
12 thereafter. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older and the juvenile is
13 able, the secretary shall prepare the permanency plan in consultation with
14 the juvenile. If a permanency plan is already in place under a child in need
15 of care proceeding, the court may adopt the plan under the present
16 proceeding. The written permanency plan shall provide for reintegration of
17 the juvenile into such juvenile's family or, if reintegration is not a viable
18 alternative, for other permanent placement of the juvenile. Reintegration
19 may not be a viable alternative when:
20 (1) The parent has been found by a court to have committed capital
21 murder, K.S.A. 21-3439 or 21-5401, prior to their repeal, aggravated
22 murder, section 2, and amendments thereto, murder in the first degree,
23 K.S.A. 21-3401, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments
24 thereto, murder in the second degree, K.S.A. 21-3402, prior to its repeal,
25 or K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto, capital murder, K.S.A. 21-
26 3439, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5401, and amendments thereto,
27 voluntary manslaughter, K.S.A. 21-3403, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-
28 5404, and amendments thereto, of a child or violated a law of another state
29 which that prohibits such murder or manslaughter of a child;
30 (2) the parent aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to
31 commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter of a child;
32 (3) the parent committed a felony battery that resulted in bodily
33 injury to the juvenile who is the subject of this proceeding or another
34 child;
35 (4) the parent has subjected the juvenile who is the subject of this
36 proceeding or another child to aggravated circumstances as defined in
37 K.S.A. 38-1502, and amendments thereto;
38 (5) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been
39 terminated involuntarily; or
40 (6) the juvenile has been in extended out-of-home placement as
41 defined in K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto.
42 (c) If the juvenile is placed in the custody of the secretary, the plan
43 shall be prepared and submitted by the secretary. If the juvenile is placed

SB 245 70
1 in the custody of a facility or person other than the secretary, the plan shall
2 be prepared and submitted by a court services officer. If the permanency
3 goal is reintegration into the family, the permanency plan shall include
4 measurable objectives and time schedules for reintegration.
5 (d) During the time a juvenile remains in the custody of the secretary,
6 the secretary shall submit to the court, at least every six months, a written
7 report of the progress being made toward the goals of the permanency plan
8 submitted pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and the specific actions taken
9 to achieve the goals of the permanency plan. If the juvenile is placed in
10 foster care, the court may request the foster parent to submit to the court,
11 at least every six months, a report in regard to the juvenile's adjustment,
12 progress and condition. Such report shall be made a part of the juvenile's
13 court social file. The court shall review the plan submitted by the secretary
14 and the report, if any, submitted by the foster parent and determine
15 whether reasonable efforts and progress have been made to achieve the
16 goals of the permanency plan. If the court determines that progress is
17 inadequate or that the permanency plan is no longer viable, the court shall
18 hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (e).
19 (e) When the secretary has custody of the juvenile, a permanency
20 hearing shall be held no more than 12 months after the juvenile is first
21 placed outside such juvenile's home and at least every 12 months
22 thereafter. Juvenile offenders who have been in extended out-of-home
23 placement shall be provided a permanency hearing within 30 days of a
24 request from the secretary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
25 represent the juvenile offender at the permanency hearing. At the
26 permanency hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable,
27 when the juvenile will be:
28 (1) Reintegrated with the juvenile's parents;
29 (2) placed for adoption;
30 (3) placed with a permanent custodian; or
31 (4) if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and the secretary has
32 documented compelling reasons why it would not be in the juvenile's best
33 interests for a placement in one of the placements pursuant to paragraphs
34 paragraph (1), (2) or (3), placed in another planned permanent
35 arrangement.
36 (f) At each permanency hearing, the court shall:
37 (1) Make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been
38 made to accomplish the permanency goal and whether continued out-of-
39 home placement is necessary for the juvenile's safety;
40 (2) make a written finding as to whether the reasonable and prudent
41 parenting standard has been met and whether the juvenile has regular,
42 ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
43 activities. The secretary shall report to the court the steps the secretary is

SB 245 71
1 taking to ensure that the reasonable and prudent parenting standard is
2 being met and that the juvenile has regular, ongoing opportunities to
3 engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including
4 consultation with the juvenile in an age-appropriate manner about the
5 opportunities of the juvenile to participate in the activities; and
6 (3) if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, document the efforts
7 made by the secretary to help the juvenile prepare for the transition from
8 custody to a successful adulthood. The secretary shall report to the court
9 the programs and services that are being provided to the juvenile which
10 that will help the juvenile prepare for the transition from custody to a
11 successful adulthood.
12 (g) The requirements of this subsection shall apply only if the
13 permanency goal in place at the time of the hearing is another planned
14 permanent arrangement as described in subsection (e)(4). At each
15 permanency hearing held with respect to the juvenile, in addition to the
16 requirements of subsection (f), the court shall:
17 (1) Ask the juvenile, if the juvenile is able, by attendance at the
18 hearing or by report to the court, about the desired permanency outcome
19 for the juvenile;
20 (2) document the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
21 unsuccessful permanency efforts made by the secretary to return the
22 juvenile home or secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing
23 relative, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent. The secretary shall report
24 to the court the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
25 unsuccessful efforts made by the secretary to return the juvenile home or
26 secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing relative, a legal
27 guardian or an adoptive parent, including efforts that utilize search
28 technology, including social media, to find biological family members of
29 the children; and
30 (3) make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of
31 the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
32 permanency plan for the juvenile and provide compelling reasons why it
33 continues to not be in the best interests of the juvenile to return home, be
34 placed for adoption, be placed with a legal guardian or be placed with a fit
35 and willing relative.
36 (h) Whenever a hearing is required under subsection (e), the court
37 shall notify all interested parties of the hearing date, the secretary, foster
38 parent and preadoptive parent or relatives providing care for the juvenile
39 and hold a hearing. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, the court
40 shall require notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing be
41 given to the juvenile. Such notice shall request the juvenile's participation
42 in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. Individuals receiving
43 notice pursuant to this subsection shall not be made a party to the action

SB 245 72
1 solely on the basis of this notice and opportunity to be heard. After
2 providing the persons receiving notice an opportunity to be heard, the
3 court shall determine whether the juvenile's needs are being adequately
4 met; whether services set out in the permanency plan necessary for the
5 safe return of the juvenile have been made available to the parent with
6 whom reintegration is planned; and whether reasonable efforts and
7 progress have been made to achieve the goals of the permanency plan.
8 (i) If the court finds reintegration continues to be a viable alternative,
9 the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the juvenile will
10 be returned to the parent. The court may rescind any of its prior
11 dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized by this
12 code or may order that a new plan for the reintegration be prepared and
13 submitted to the court. If reintegration cannot be accomplished as
14 approved by the court, the court shall be informed and shall schedule a
15 hearing pursuant to subsection (j). No such hearing is required when the
16 parent voluntarily relinquishes parental rights or agrees to appointment of
17 a permanent guardian.
18 (j) When the court finds any of the following conditions exist, the
19 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee shall
20 file a petition alleging the juvenile to be a child in need of care and
21 requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to the Kansas code for
22 care of children:
23 (1) The court determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative
24 and either adoption or permanent guardianship might be in the best
25 interests of the juvenile;
26 (2) the goal of the permanency plan is reintegration into the family
27 and the court determines after 12 months from the time such plan is first
28 submitted that progress is inadequate; or
29 (3) the juvenile has been in out-of-home placement for a cumulative
30 total of 15 of the last 22 months, excluding trial home visits and juvenile in
31 runaway status.
32 Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit termination of
33 parental rights prior to the expiration of 12 months.
34 (k) A petition to terminate parental rights is not required to be filed if
35 one of the following exceptions is documented to exist:
36 (1) The juvenile is in a stable placement with relatives;
37 (2) services set out in the case plan necessary for the safe return of
38 the juvenile have not been made available to the parent with whom
39 reintegration is planned; or
40 (3) there are one or more documented reasons why such filing would
41 not be in the best interests of the juvenile. Documented reasons may
42 include, but are not limited to: The juvenile has close emotional bonds
43 with a parent which that should not be broken; the juvenile is 14 years of

SB 245 73
1 age or older and, after advice and counsel, refuses to be adopted;
2 insufficient grounds exist for termination of parental rights; the juvenile is
3 an unaccompanied refugee minor; or there are international legal or
4 compelling foreign policy reasons precluding termination of parental
5 rights.
