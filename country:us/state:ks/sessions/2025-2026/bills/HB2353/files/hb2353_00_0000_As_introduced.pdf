12 If you decide to take any abortion-inducing medicine or drug to end
13 your pregnancy, the state of Kansas wants you to be aware that you and
14 your family may hold the manufacturer, distributor and your physician or
15 healthcare provider financially accountable should you die, suffer injury,
16 complication or any debilitating side effects, or should the physician or
17 healthcare provider fail to address side effects, or should the medication
18 fail to work such that your pregnancy continues, resulting in an incomplete
19 abortion or in your being required to undergo surgical intervention.
20 You and your family may also hold the abortion-inducing medicine or
21 drug provider, the physician or healthcare provider or an agent of the
22 abortion-inducing medicine or drug provider, physician or healthcare
23 provider accountable for failing to inform you of complications.
24 If you experience complications and are in need of emergency care or a
25 hospital visit, you have the right to tell the physician or healthcare provider
26 treating the complications that you have had an abortion-inducing
27 medicine or drug. Providing this information will not result in any criminal
28 or civil penalty and will further help save your life."
29 (b) As used in this section, "abortion" and "physician" mean the same
30 as defined in K.S.A. 65-6701, and amendments thereto.
31 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
32 publication in the statute book.
