27 supervisor, who has determined that such information is satisfactory to
28 allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach,
29 as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis handbook; and
30 (b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in a
31 reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
32 commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
33 the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
34 groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
35 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
36 amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
37 capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United
38 States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary
39 consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate
40 by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency
41 monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance
42 marketplace.
43 (C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital

HB 2128—Am. by SC 12
1 calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead
2 state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling
3 person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a
4 limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria specified
5 by the commissioner in regulation.
6 (D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
7 holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements
8 for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this
9 section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital
10 calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the
11 lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.
12 (E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
13 registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
14 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall
15 be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding
16 company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
17 analysis handbook and that:
18 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
19 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
20 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
21 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
22 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
23 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
24 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
25 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
26 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
27 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
28 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
29 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
30 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
31 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
32 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
33 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
34 framework for that data year.
35 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
36 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
37 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
38 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
39 determination for an insurer.
40 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
41 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
42 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
43 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the

HB 2128—Am. by SC 13
1 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
2 framework.
3 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
4 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
5 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
6 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
7 insurer, as applicable.
8 Sec. 6. 7. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
9 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
10 shall be subject to the following standards:
11 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
12 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
13 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
14 commissioner of insurance;
15 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
16 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
17 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
18 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
19 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
20 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
21 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
22 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
23 to the respective parties; and
24 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
25 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
26 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
27 to its financial needs.
28 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
29 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
30 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
31 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
32 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
33 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
34 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
35 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
36 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
37 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
38 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
39 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
40 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
41 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
42 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
43 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to

HB 2128—Am. by SC 14
1 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
2 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
3 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
4 only with a specific person;
5 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
6 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
7 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
8 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
9 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
10 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
11 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
12 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
13 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
14 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
15 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
16 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
17 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
18 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
19 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
20 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
21 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
22 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
23 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
24 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
25 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
26 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
27 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
28 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
29 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
30 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
31 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
32 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
33 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
34 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
35 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
36 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
37 such period.
38 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
39 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
40 exceed:
41 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
42 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
43 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,

HB 2128—Am. by SC 15
1 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
2 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
3 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
4 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
5 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
6 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
7 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
8 transactions are equal to or exceed:
9 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
10 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
11 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
12 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
13 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
14 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
15 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
16 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
17 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
18 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
19 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
20 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
21 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
22 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
23 more affiliates of the insurer;
24 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
25 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
26 (5) any material material transactions, specified by rules and
27 regulations, which that the commissioner of insurance determines may
28 adversely affect the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
29 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
30 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
31 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
32 otherwise contrary to law.
33 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
34 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
35 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
36 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
37 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner
38 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into
39 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
40 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
41 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
42 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
43 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such

HB 2128—Am. by SC 16
1 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
2 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
3 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
4 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
5 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
6 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
7 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
8 be subject to the requirements of this section.
9 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
10 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
11 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
12 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
13 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
14 payment; or
15 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
16 such 30-day period.
17 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
18 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
19 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
20 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
21 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
22 December 31 immediately preceding; or
23 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
24 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
25 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
26 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
27 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
28 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
29 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
30 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
31 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
32 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
33 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
34 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
35 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
36 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
37 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
38 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
39 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
40 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
41 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
42 accordance with this section.
43 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may

HB 2128—Am. by SC 17
1 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
2 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
3 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
4 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
5 such dividend or distribution; or
6 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
7 within the 30-day period referred to above.
8 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
9 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
10 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
11 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
12 operating identity consistent with this act.
13 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
14 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
15 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
16 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
17 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
18 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
19 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
20 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
21 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
22 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
23 other appropriate criteria;
24 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
25 several lines of insurance;
26 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
27 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
28 risks;
29 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
30 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
31 portfolio;
32 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
33 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
34 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
35 comparable insurers;
36 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
37 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
38 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
39 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
40 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
41 such investment so warrants; and
42 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
43 reported earnings include extraordinary items.

HB 2128—Am. by SC 18
1 Sec. 7. 8. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-

14 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce

16 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
17 act.
18 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of

6 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
7 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
8 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
9 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
10 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
11 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
12 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
13 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
14 examined.
15 Sec. 8. 9. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
16 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or

30 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
31 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the

35 may publish all or any part thereof in such a manner as the commissioner
36 of insurance may deem appropriate. In making such determination, the
37 commissioner of insurance also shall take into consideration any potential
38 adverse consequences of the disclosure thereof.
