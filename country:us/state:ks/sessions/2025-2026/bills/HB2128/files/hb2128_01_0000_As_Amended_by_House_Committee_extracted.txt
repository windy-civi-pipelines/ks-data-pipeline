24 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
25 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
26 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
27 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
28 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
29 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
30 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
31 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
32 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
33 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
34 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
35 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
36 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
37 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
38 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
39 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
40 framework for that data year.
41 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
42 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
43 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the
HB 2128—Am. by HC 12
1 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
2 determination for an insurer.
3 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
4 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
5 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
6 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
7 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
8 framework.
9 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
10 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
11 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
12 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
13 insurer, as applicable.
14 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
15 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
16 shall be subject to the following standards:
17 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
18 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
19 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
20 commissioner of insurance;
21 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
22 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
23 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
24 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
25 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
26 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
27 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
28 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
29 to the respective parties; and
30 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
31 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
32 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
33 to its financial needs.
34 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
35 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
36 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
37 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
38 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
39 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
40 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
41 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
42 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
43 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
HB 2128—Am. by HC 13
1 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
2 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
3 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
4 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
5 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
6 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
7 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
8 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
9 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
10 only with a specific person;
11 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
12 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
13 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
14 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
15 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
16 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
17 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
18 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
19 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
20 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
21 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
22 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
23 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
24 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
25 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
26 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
27 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
28 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
29 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
30 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
31 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
32 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
33 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
34 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
35 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
36 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
37 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
38 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
39 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
40 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
41 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
42 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
43 such period.
HB 2128—Am. by HC 14
1 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
2 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
3 exceed:
4 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
5 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
6 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
7 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
8 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
9 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
10 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
11 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
12 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
13 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
14 transactions are equal to or exceed:
15 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
16 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
17 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
18 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
19 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
20 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
21 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
22 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
23 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
24 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
25 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
26 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
27 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
28 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
29 more affiliates of the insurer;
30 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
31 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
32 (5) any material material transactions, specified by rules and
33 regulations, which that the commissioner of insurance determines may
34 adversely affect the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
35 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
36 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
37 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
38 otherwise contrary to law.
39 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
40 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
41 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
42 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
43 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner
HB 2128—Am. by HC 15
1 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into
2 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
3 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
4 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
5 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
6 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
7 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
8 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
9 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
10 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
11 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
12 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
13 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
14 be subject to the requirements of this section.
15 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
16 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
17 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
18 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
19 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
20 payment; or
21 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
22 such 30-day period.
23 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
24 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
25 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
26 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
27 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
28 December 31 immediately preceding; or
29 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
30 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
31 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
32 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
33 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
34 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
35 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
36 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
37 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
38 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
39 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
40 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
41 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
42 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
43 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,
HB 2128—Am. by HC 16
1 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
2 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
3 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
4 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
5 accordance with this section.
6 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
7 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
8 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
9 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
10 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
11 such dividend or distribution; or
12 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
13 within the 30-day period referred to above.
14 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
15 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
16 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
17 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
18 operating identity consistent with this act.
19 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
20 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
21 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
22 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
23 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
24 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
25 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
26 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
27 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
28 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
29 other appropriate criteria;
30 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
31 several lines of insurance;
32 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
33 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
34 risks;
35 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
36 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
37 portfolio;
38 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
39 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
40 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
41 comparable insurers;
42 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
43 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
HB 2128—Am. by HC 17
1 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
2 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
3 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
4 such investment so warrants; and
5 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
6 reported earnings include extraordinary items.
7 Sec. 7. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
8 3307. (a) Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in addition

15 enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party or by any
16 entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company
17 system or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated
18 basis.
19 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
20 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
21 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
22 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
23 act.
24 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
25 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
26 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
27 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
28 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
29 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
30 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
31 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
32 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
33 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
34 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,
35 after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of not more than
36 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
37 insurer.
38 (c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered
39 insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts
40 not otherwise a part of the staff of the commissioner of insurance as the
41 commissioner of insurance shall determine to be reasonably necessary to
42 assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (a). Any persons
43 so retained shall be under the direction and control of the commissioner of
HB 2128—Am. by HC 18
1 insurance and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.
2 (d) Each registered insurer producing examination records, books and
3 papers pursuant to subsection (a) shall be liable for and shall pay the
4 expense of such examination in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223 and
5 K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
6 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
7 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
8 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
9 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance
10 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
11 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
12 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
13 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
14 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
15 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
16 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
17 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
18 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
19 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
20 examined.
21 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
22 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or
23 disclosed to the commissioner of insurance or any other person in the
24 course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to K.S.A. 40-

32 private civil action.
33 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance shall not otherwise make the

35 consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the commissioner of
36 insurance, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected
37 thereby notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the
38 provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act, determines that the
39 interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public would be served by
40 the publication thereof, in which event, the commissioner of insurance
41 may publish all or any part thereof in such a manner as the commissioner
42 of insurance may deem appropriate. In making such determination, the
43 commissioner of insurance also shall take into consideration any potential
HB 2128—Am. by HC 19
1 adverse consequences of the disclosure thereof.
2 (2) For purposes of the information reported and provided to the
3 commissioner pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304 through 40-3307, and

19 confidential documents, materials or information subject to subsection (a).
20 (d) In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner of
21 insurance's duties, the commissioner of insurance:
22 (1) May share documents, materials or other information, including
23 the confidential and privileged documents, materials or information
24 subject to subsection (a), with other state, federal and international

42 of the consultant to the applicable insurers.
43 (e) The sharing of information by the commissioner of insurance,
HB 2128—Am. by HC 21
1 pursuant to this act, shall not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority

11 insurer's principal officers have approved, implemented and continue to
12 maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control
13 procedures; and
14 (8) any other information required by the commissioner of insurance
15 by rules and regulations.
16 (c) All registration statements shall be accompanied by a summary
17 outlining all items in the current registration statement representing
18 changes from the prior registration statement.
19 (d) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement
20 filed pursuant to subsection (b) if such information is not material for the
21 purpose of this section. Unless the commissioner of insurance by rules and
22 regulations or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans
23 or extensions of credit, investments or guarantees, involving 0.5% or less
24 of an insurer's admitted assets as of the December 31 immediately next
25 preceding shall be deemed immaterial for purposes of this section.
26 (e) Each registered insurer shall keep current the information required
27 to be disclosed in such insurer's registration statement by reporting all
28 material changes or additions on amendment forms provided by the
29 commissioner of insurance within 15 days after the end of the month in

33 distribution shall not be paid for at least 10 business days from the
34 commissioner's receipt of the notice of its declaration.
35 (f) Any person within an insurance holding company system subject
36 to registration shall provide complete and accurate information to an
37 insurer, where if such information is reasonably necessary to enable the
38 insurer to comply with the provisions of this act.
39 (g) The commissioner of insurance shall terminate the registration of
40 any insurer that demonstrates that such insurer is no longer is a member of
41 an insurance holding company system.
42 (h) The commissioner of insurance may require or allow two or more
43 affiliated insurers subject to registration hereunder to file a consolidated

HB 2128—Am. by HC 9
1 registration statement.
2 (i) The commissioner of insurance may allow an insurer that is
3 authorized to do business in this state and that is part of an insurance
4 holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer that
5 is required to register under subsection (a) and to file all information and
6 material required to be filed under this section.
7 (j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any information or
8 transaction if and to the extent the commissioner of insurance by rule and
9 regulation or order exempts the same from the provisions of this section.
10 (k) Any person may file with the commissioner of insurance a
11 disclaimer of affiliation with any authorized insurer or such a disclaimer
12 may be filed by such insurer or any member of an insurance holding
13 company system. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all material
14 relationships and bases for affiliation between such person and such
15 insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation. After a
16 disclaimer has been filed, the insurer shall be relieved of any duty to
17 register or report under this section which that may arise out of the
18 insurer's relationship with such person unless and until the commissioner
19 of insurance disallows such a disclaimer. The commissioner of insurance
20 shall disallow such a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest
21 with notice and opportunity to be heard in accordance with the provisions
22 of the Kansas administrative procedure act.
23 (l) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the ultimate controlling
24 person of every insurer subject to registration also shall file an annual
25 enterprise risk report. The report, to the best of the ultimate controlling
26 person's knowledge and belief, shall identify the material risks within the
27 insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the
28 insurer. The report shall be appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity
29 of the insurer. The report shall be filed with the lead state commissioner of
30 insurance of the insurance holding company system as determined by the
31 procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the national
32 association of insurance commissioners NAIC. The first enterprise risk
33 report shall be filed no not later than May 1, 2015, and annually thereafter
34 by May 1 of each year unless the commissioner of insurance extends the
35 time for filing for good cause shown.
36 (2) The ultimate controlling person of a domestic insurer that is
37 authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business of insurance only
38 in this state with total direct and assumed annual premiums of less than
39 $300 million is not required to submit an enterprise risk report under
40 paragraph (1) unless the ultimate controlling person of the domestic
41 insurer also controls other insurers that do not meet the requirements of
42 this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, an insurer is not
43 considered to be authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business

HB 2128—Am. by HC 10
1 of insurance only in this state if the insurer directly or indirectly writes or
2 assumes insurance in any other manner in another state(A) Except as
3 provided hereunder, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer
4 subject to registration shall concurrently file with the registration an
5 annual group capital calculation as directed by the lead state
6 commissioner. The report shall be completed in accordance with the NAIC
7 group capital calculation instructions, which may permit the lead state
8 commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate
9 controlling person to file the group capital calculation. The report shall be
10 filed with the lead state commissioner of the insurance holding company
11 system as determined by the commissioner of insurance in accordance
12 with the procedures within the financial analysis handbook. An insurance
13 holding company system shall be exempt from filing the group capital
14 calculation if:
15 (i) It has only one insurer within its holding company structure, only
16 writes business is only licensed in its domestic state and assumes no
17 business from any other insurer;
18 (ii) it is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by
19 the board of governors of the federal reserve system. The lead state
20 commissioner shall request the calculation from the federal reserve board
21 under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. If the federal
22 reserve board cannot share the calculation with the lead state
23 commissioner, the insurance holding company shall not be exempt from
24 the group capital calculation filing;
25 (iii) its non-United States group-wide supervisor is located within a
26 reciprocal jurisdiction, as defined in K.S.A. 40-221a, and amendments
27 thereto, that recognizes the United States regulatory approach to group
28 supervision and group capital; and
29 (iv) it is an insurance holding company system:
30 (a) That provides information to the lead state that meets the
31 requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and
32 accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-wide
33 supervisor, who has determined that such information is satisfactory to
34 allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group supervision approach,
35 as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis handbook; and
36 (b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in a
37 reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
38 commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
39 the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
40 groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
41 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
42 amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
43 capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United

HB 2128—Am. by HC 11
1 States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary
2 consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate
3 by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight and solvency
4 monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance
5 marketplace.
6 (C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital
7 calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead
8 state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling
9 person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a
10 limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria specified
11 by the commissioner in regulation.
12 (D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
13 holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements
14 for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this
15 section, the insurance holding company system shall file the group capital
16 calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the
17 lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown.
18 (E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
19 registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework
20 shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test. The filing shall
21 be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of the insurance holding
22 company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
23 analysis handbook and that:
24 (i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria
25 applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are reviewed at
26 least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any
27 change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for
28 which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be effective on January
29 1 of the year following the calendar year in which such changes are
30 adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
31 considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the
32 specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner, in
33 consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor,
34 determines that such insurer should not be scoped into the framework for
35 that data year. Similarly, insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold
36 of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress
37 test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance
38 commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force
39 or its successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
40 framework for that data year.
41 (ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with the
42 financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the concerns of
43 regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and out of the

HB 2128—Am. by HC 12
1 NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as part of the
2 determination for an insurer.
3 (F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
4 liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
5 framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead
6 state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with the
7 financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the
8 framework.
9 (m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of the
10 insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the registration
11 statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time for filing shall
12 be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate controlling person of the
13 insurer, as applicable.
14 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
15 3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their affiliates
16 shall be subject to the following standards:
17 (1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
18 (2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
19 include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by the
20 commissioner of insurance;
21 (3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
22 (4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
23 transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
24 requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
25 (5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
26 transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose the
27 nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
28 information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or fees
29 to the respective parties; and
30 (6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
31 transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
32 reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate
33 to its financial needs.
34 (b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the commissioner
35 of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by K.S.A.
36 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition that would be grounds
37 for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding, then the
38 commissioner may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a
39 deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as determined by the insurer
40 at the insurer's discretion, for the protection of the insurer for the duration
41 of the contract or agreement or the existence of the condition for which the
42 commissioner required the deposit or the bond.
43 (2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the

HB 2128—Am. by HC 13
1 commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
2 affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer
3 were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a
4 hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for
5 supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or
6 bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the discretion to
7 determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the
8 contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond
9 should be required for a single contract, multiple contracts or a contract
10 only with a specific person;
11 (c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
12 shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
13 insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
14 segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
15 records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property of
16 the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited to,
17 claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files,
18 premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records,
19 financial records or similar records within the possession, custody or
20 control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the insurer. At the
21 request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the receiver may
22 obtain a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer's
23 business, obtain access to the operating systems upon which the data is
24 maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through
25 assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise and restrict the use of the
26 data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer's business. The
27 affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance
28 to provide the insurer with access to all records and data in the event of
29 the affiliate's default under a lease or other agreement; and
30 (d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
31 collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property of
32 and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the event
33 that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to K.S.A. 40-
34 3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
35 (b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
36 any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system, including
37 amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements previously filed
38 pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless the insurer has
39 notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of such insurer's
40 intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days prior thereto, or
41 such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance may permit, and the
42 commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such transaction within
43 such period.

1 (1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
2 guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
3 exceed:
4 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
5 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
6 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
7 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
8 (2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an affiliate,
9 where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit with the
10 agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such transactions, in
11 whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make loans or extensions of
12 credit to, purchase assets of, or make investments in, any affiliate of the
13 insurer making such loans or extensions of credit provided if such
14 transactions are equal to or exceed:
15 (A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the insurer's
16 admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
17 (B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted assets,
18 each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
19 (3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
20 (A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
21 (B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the
22 insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a projected
23 change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three consecutive years
24 equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, as
25 of December 31 immediately preceding, including those agreements which
26 that may require as consideration the transfer of assets from an insurer to a
27 nonaffiliate, if an agreement or understanding exists between the insurer
28 and nonaffiliate that any portion of such assets will be transferred to one or
29 more affiliates of the insurer;
30 (4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
31 agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
32 (5) any material material transactions, specified by rules and
33 regulations, which that the commissioner of insurance determines may
34 adversely affect the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
35 Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
36 authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an insurer
37 not a member of the same insurance holding company system, would be
38 otherwise contrary to law.
39 (c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions which
40 that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons within the
41 insurance holding company system if the purpose of those separate
42 transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under this section
43 and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the commissioner

HB 2128—Am. by HC 15
1 of insurance determines that such separate transactions were entered into
2 over any 12-month period for such purpose, the commissioner of insurance
3 may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-3311, and amendments thereto.
4 (d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
5 pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
6 comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
7 transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
8 (e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30 days
9 of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the
10 total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding company
11 system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
12 (f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
13 insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall not
14 be subject to the requirements of this section.
15 (g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
16 amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any
17 other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
18 (A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received notice
19 of the declaration thereof and has not within such period disapproved such
20 payment; or
21 (B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment within
22 such 30-day period.
23 (2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
24 distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property,
25 the fair market value of which, together with that of other dividends or
26 distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:
27 (i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
28 December 31 immediately preceding; or
29 (ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
30 life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
31 including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending December
32 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions
33 of any class of the insurer's own securities.
34 (B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
35 extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward net
36 income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been
37 paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be computed
38 by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar
39 years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the
40 second and immediately preceding calendar years.
41 (C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include any
42 dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than earned
43 surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A. 40-233,

HB 2128—Am. by HC 16
1 and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
2 amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
3 subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
4 from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
5 accordance with this section.
6 (3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
7 declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is conditional
8 upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No declaration shall
9 confer any rights upon shareholders until:
10 (A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
11 such dividend or distribution; or
12 (B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such payment
13 within the 30-day period referred to above.
14 (h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any
15 person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
16 relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
17 subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate
18 operating identity consistent with this act.
19 (2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or
20 sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel,
21 property or services with one or more other persons under arrangements
22 meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and amendments thereto.
23 (i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
24 surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
25 outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs, the
26 following factors, among others, shall be considered:
27 (1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
28 capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
29 other appropriate criteria;
30 (2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the
31 several lines of insurance;
32 (3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
33 (4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured
34 risks;
35 (5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
36 (6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's investment
37 portfolio;
38 (7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
39 performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
40 (8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
41 comparable insurers;
42 (9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
43 (10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The

HB 2128—Am. by HC 17
1 commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a disallowed
2 asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards
3 policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner of insurance
4 such investment so warrants; and
5 (11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which the
6 reported earnings include extraordinary items.
7 Sec. 7. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
8 3307. (a) Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in addition
9 to the powers which that the commissioner of insurance has under K.S.A.

15 enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate controlling party or by any
16 entity or combination of entities within the insurance holding company
17 system or by the insurance holding company system on a consolidated
18 basis.
19 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
20 registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
21 such records, books or other information in the possession of the insurer or
22 its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this
23 act.
24 (2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
25 insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
26 amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of the
27 insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant to
28 contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In the
29 event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by the
30 commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the commissioner of
31 insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the insurer cannot
32 obtain the information and the identity of the holder of information.
33 Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that the detailed
34 explanation is without merit, the commissioner of insurance may require,
35 after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a penalty of not more than
36 $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend or revoke the license of the
37 insurer.
38 (c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered
39 insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other experts
40 not otherwise a part of the staff of the commissioner of insurance as the
41 commissioner of insurance shall determine to be reasonably necessary to
42 assist in the conduct of the examination under subsection (a). Any persons
43 so retained shall be under the direction and control of the commissioner of

HB 2128—Am. by HC 18
1 insurance and shall act in a purely advisory capacity.
2 (d) Each registered insurer producing examination records, books and
3 papers pursuant to subsection (a) shall be liable for and shall pay the
4 expense of such examination in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223 and
5 K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
6 (e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
7 subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
8 purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure or
9 refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of insurance
10 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proper showing,
11 the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify
12 or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey the court order shall be
13 punishable as contempt of court. Every person subpoenaed shall be
14 obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified in the subpoena, when
15 subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such subpoenaed person shall be
16 entitled to the same fees and mileage, if claimed, as a witness in K.S.A.
17 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees, mileage and actual expense, if any,
18 necessarily incurred in securing the attendance and testimony of witnesses
19 shall be itemized, charged against and paid by the company being
20 examined.
21 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 40-3308 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
22 3308. (a) Documents, materials or other information obtained by or
23 disclosed to the commissioner of insurance or any other person in the
24 course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to K.S.A. 40-
25 3307, and amendments thereto, and all information reported pursuant to
26 K.S.A. 40-3304, 40-3305 and 40-3306, and amendments thereto, shall:

29 K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., and amendments thereto;
30 (3) not be subject to subpoena; and
31 (4) not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any
32 private civil action.
33 (b) (1) The commissioner of insurance shall not otherwise make the
34 documents, materials or other information public without the prior written
