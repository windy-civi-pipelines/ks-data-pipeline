34 (c) Subdivision regulations may provide for administrative changes to

SB 37 2
1 Such regulations may provide for the payment of a fee in lieu of dedication
2 of land. Such regulations may provide that in lieu of the completion of any
3 work or improvements prior to the final approval of the plat, the governing
4 body may accept a corporate surety bond, cashier's check, escrow account,
5 letter of credit or other like security in an amount to be fixed by the
6 governing body and conditioned upon the actual completion of such work
7 or improvements within a specified period, in accordance with such
8 regulations, and the governing body may enforce such bond by all
9 equitable remedies.
10 (d) Before adopting or amending any subdivision regulations, the
11 planning commission shall call and hold a hearing on such regulations or
12 amendments thereto. Notice of such hearing shall be published at least
13 once in the official city newspaper in the case of a city or in the official
14 county newspaper in the case of a county. Such notice shall be published at
15 least 20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall fix the time and place
16 for such hearing and shall describe such proposal in general terms. In the
17 case of a joint committee on subdivision regulations, such notice shall be
18 published in the official city and official county newspapers. The hearing
19 may be adjourned from time to time and at the conclusion of the same, the
20 planning commission shall prepare its recommendations and by an
21 affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the commission
22 adopt the same in the form of proposed subdivision regulations and shall
23 submit the same, together with the written summary of the hearing
24 thereon, to the governing body. The governing body either may: (1)
25 Approve such recommendations by ordinance in a city or resolution in a
26 county; (2) override the planning commission's recommendations by a 2/
3
27 majority vote; or (3) may return the same to the planning commission for
28 further consideration, together with a statement specifying the basis for the
29 governing body's failure to approve or disapprove. If the governing body
30 returns the planning commission's recommendations, the planning
31 commission, after considering the same, may resubmit its original
32 recommendations giving the reasons therefor or submit new and amended
33 recommendations. Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the
34 governing body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or
35 amend and adopt such recommendations by the respective ordinance or
36 resolution, or it need take no further action thereon. If the planning
37 commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the governing body
38 following the planning commission's next regular meeting after receipt of
39 the governing body's report, the governing body shall consider such course
40 of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the
41 original recommendations and proceed accordingly. The proposed
42 subdivision regulations and any amendments thereto shall become
43 effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance or

SB 37 3
1 resolution.
2 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 12-715b, 12-715c, 12-715d and 12-749 are hereby
3 repealed.
4 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
5 publication in the statute book.
