instrumentalities. When the government of the United States, its
agencies or instrumentalities shall contract for the erection, repair, or
enlargement of any building or other project, it shall obtain from the

project involved, and the contractor may purchase materials for

SENATE BILL No. 98—page 39
When such eligible not-for-profit corporation contracts for the purpose

obtain from the state and furnish to the contractor an exemption
certificate for the project involved, and such contractor may purchase

purchases are made, and such suppliers shall execute invoices covering
such purchases bearing the number of such certificate. Upon
completion of the project, the contractor shall furnish to such eligible
not-for-profit corporation a sworn statement, on a form to be provided
by the director of taxation, that all purchases so made were entitled to
exemption under this subsection. All invoices shall be held by the
contractor for a period of five years and shall be subject to audit by the
director of taxation. If any materials purchased under such a certificate
are found not to have been incorporated in the building or returned for

certificate for any purpose other than that for which such a certificate is

imposed upon such materials shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and,
upon conviction therefor, shall be subject to the penalties provided for
in K.S.A. 79-3615(h), and amendments thereto.
(2) Sales tax paid on and after May 19, 2023, but prior to the

had such sale occurred after the effective date of this act shall be
refunded. Each claim for a sales tax refund shall be verified and
submitted to the director of taxation upon forms furnished by the
director and shall be accompanied by any additional documentation
required by the director. The director shall review each claim and shall
refund that amount of sales tax paid as determined under the provisions
of this subsection. All refunds shall be paid from the sales tax refund
fund upon warrants of the director of accounts and reports pursuant to
vouchers approved by the director or the director's designee; and
(wwww) (1) all sales of tangible personal property or services
purchased by a pregnancy resource center or residential maternity

commerce, the sale and installation of machinery and data center
equipment and eligible data center costs purchased by such qualified
firm for such qualified data center and labor services to install, apply,
repair, service, alter or maintain data center equipment of such
qualified firm at such qualified data center. When a person contracts
for the construction, reconstruction, enlargement or remodeling of any
such qualified data center, such person shall obtain from the state and
furnish to the contractor an exemption certificate for the project
involved, and the contractor may purchase materials, machinery and
equipment for incorporation in such project. The contractor shall
furnish the number of such certificates to all suppliers from whom such
purchases are made, and such suppliers shall execute invoices covering
such purchases bearing the number of such certificates. Upon
completion of the project, the contractor shall furnish to the owner of
the qualified firm a sworn statement, on a form to be provided by the
director of taxation, that all purchases so made were entitled to
exemption under this subsection. All invoices shall be held by the
contractor for a period of five years and shall be subject to audit by the
director of taxation. Any contractor or any agent, employee or
subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise dispose of any
materials, machinery or equipment purchased under such a certificate
for any purpose other than that for which such a certificate is issued
without the payment of the sales or compensating tax otherwise
imposed thereon shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be subject to the penalties provided for in K.S.A. 79-
3615(h), and amendments thereto. As used in this subsection, "data
center equipment," "eligible data center costs," "qualified data center"
and "qualified firm" mean the same as defined in section 1, and
amendments thereto.
Sec. 7. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 66-101j and 79-3606 are hereby
