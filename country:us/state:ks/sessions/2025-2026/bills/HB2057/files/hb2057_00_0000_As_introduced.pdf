17 alternate in appointing the chairperson and vice chairperson. The vice
18 chairperson shall exercise all the powers of the chairperson in the absence

26 only receive nominations of persons to fill the vacancy from members of
27 the legislature. Each member of the legislature may nominate one person
28 for consideration by the joint committee. Any person so nominated may
29 decline such nomination by submitting written notice thereof to the
30 chairperson.
31 (b) The joint committee shall review each nominee to verify that such
32 nominee satisfies federal and state requirements to hold such office and to
33 be appointed to fill a vacancy in such office.
34 (c) The joint committee shall conduct one or more public hearings on
35 the nominations and shall grant each nominee an opportunity to be heard
36 before the joint committee.
37 (d) At the conclusion of its public hearings, the joint committee shall
38 submit a report to the senate and the house of representatives identifying
39 five nominees for further consideration by the legislature.
40 New Sec. 4. (a) Either during the regular session of the legislature if
41 the joint committee meets during such regular session, or at the next
42 regular session or special session of the legislature if the joint committee
43 meets outside of the regular session, the legislature may adopt a concurrent

HB 2057 3
1 resolution calling for a joint session of the legislature to consider the
2 nominees identified by the joint committee under section 3, and
3 amendments thereto. Upon adoption of a concurrent resolution by both
4 houses of the legislature establishing the date and time for a joint session
5 of the legislature, the senate and the house of representatives shall meet in
6 joint session on such date and time for such purpose. The legislature, when
7 convened in such joint session, shall have no power to perform any act
8 other than considering such nominees.
9 (b) When in joint session pursuant to this section, the president of the
10 senate shall preside over the proceedings and if the office of the president
11 is vacant or the president is unable to do so, the speaker of the house of
12 representatives shall preside over the proceedings. The chief clerk of the
13 house of representatives and the secretary of the senate shall each keep a
14 record of the proceedings. It shall be the duty of the chief clerk and the
15 secretary to report such proceedings to their respective houses and record
16 such proceedings in their respective journals.
17 (c) The rules of the house of representatives and the joint rules of the

20 not directly conflict with the provisions of sections 2 through 7, and
21 amendments thereto.
22 New Sec. 5. (a) All votes for nominees in a joint session of the
23 legislature shall be taken by voice vote. For each such vote, the secretary
24 of the senate shall first call the names of the members of the senate, and
25 then the chief clerk of the house of representatives shall call the names of
26 the members of the house. Each member of the legislature in attendance at
27 the joint session shall be required to vote on all nominees unless excused
28 by a majority vote of the members of the legislature in attendance.
29 (b) Each nominee identified in the report of the joint committee on
30 vacancy appointments shall be considered and voted upon separately. The
31 nominees so identified shall be considered in alphabetical order based on
32 the nominees' surnames.
33 (c) Any nominee who receives an affirmative vote from a majority of
34 both the members of the senate and the members of the house of
35 representatives shall be designated by the legislature as a candidate to
36 temporarily fill the vacancy in such office. If a nominee fails to receive the
37 required affirmative vote to be designated as a candidate, a motion to
38 reconsider such nominee shall be in order only after all nominees have
39 been considered and initially voted upon. If a nominee fails to receive the
40 required affirmative vote after a motion to reconsider such nominee, no
41 second or subsequent motion to reconsider such nominee shall be in order.
42 (d) When three nominees have received the required affirmative vote
43 to be designated as candidates pursuant to subsection (c), the consideration

4 votes to be designated as candidates, the legislature shall direct the joint
5 committee on vacancy appointments to reconvene for the consideration of
6 additional nominees to fill such vacancy.
7 (2) When directed to do so by the legislature, the joint committee
8 shall reconvene and act in accordance with section 3, and amendments
9 thereto. When submitting any second or subsequent report, the joint
10 committee may recommend one or more of the nominees who were
11 recommended in any prior report of the joint committee.
12 New Sec. 6. (a) Upon the adjournment of a joint session of the
13 legislature at which three nominees received the required affirmative vote
14 to be designated as candidates to fill the vacancy in such office, the
15 speaker of the house of representatives shall cause a concurrent resolution
16 to be introduced in the house designating such nominees as candidates.
17 (b) The legislature shall adopt a concurrent resolution designating
18 three individuals as candidates to fill the vacancy in such office not more
19 than 21 calendar days after such vacancy occurs.
20 (c) The time period set forth in subsection (b) may be extended by a
21 vote of 2/ of the members of both the senate and the house of
3
22 representatives, but in no event shall any such extension exceed seven
23 calendar days.
