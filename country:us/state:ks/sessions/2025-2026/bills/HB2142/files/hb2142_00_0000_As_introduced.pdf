4 and repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 New Section 1. (a) Any person who makes a report alleging bullying
8 may request that the school district conduct an independent review if such
9 person:
10 (1) Believes that the school administrator did not correctly analyze
11 the complaint and failed to conduct an investigation of the incident,
12 because the school administrator believed the alleged conduct did not
13 constitute bullying;
14 (2) is dissatisfied with the final determination of the school
15 administrator following an investigation; or
16 (3) believes that although a final determination was made that
17 bullying occurred, the school's response was inadequate to correct the
18 problem.
19 (b) Any such request shall be made in writing to the superintendent of
20 the school district. Upon receipt of such request, the superintendent shall
21 promptly notify the board of education of the district of such request. The
22 board of education may conduct its own review or direct the initiation of
23 an independent review.
24 (c) Upon direction by the board of education or, after completion of
25 such board's review, upon renewal of such request by the person who
26 originally requested an independent review, the superintendent shall
27 promptly initiate an independent review by a neutral person, and the
28 school administrator who received the initial report and any other staff
29 members shall cooperate with the independent review such that the review
30 may proceed expeditiously. The independent review shall consist of an
31 interview of the person who made the initial report and any relevant staff
32 members and a review of the written materials from the school
33 administrator's investigation.
