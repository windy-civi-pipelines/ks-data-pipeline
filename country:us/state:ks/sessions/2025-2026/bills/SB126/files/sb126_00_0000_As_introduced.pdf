Session of 2025
SENATE BILL No. 126
By Committee on Public Health and Welfare
1-30
1 AN ACT concerning the healing arts; relating to physician assistants;
2 enacting the physician assistant licensure compact to provide interstate
3 practice privileges.
4
5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the physician
7 assistant licensure compact.
8 SECTION 1—PURPOSE
9
10 In order to strengthen access to medical services and in recognition of
11 the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of
12 the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a
13 comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state
14 licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the
15 portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of
16 patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via
17 the mutual recognition of the licensee's qualifying license by other
18 compact-participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
19 standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of
20 medical services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time
21 of the patient encounter and, therefore, requires the PA to be under the
22 jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State
23 licensing boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to
24 impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a
25 PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will
26 alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military
27 personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having
28 an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

1 state to remove a licensee's compact privilege or take other action
2 necessary under applicable law to protect the health and safety of its
3 citizens; and
4 (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
5 the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of

14 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), subpoenas shall not be issued
15 by a participating state to gather evidence of conduct in another state that
16 is lawful in such other state for the purpose of taking adverse action
17 against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a compact
18 privilege in the participating state.
19 (d) Nothing in this compact shall be deemed to authorize a

24 issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect to
25 reported conduct received from any other participating state as it would if
26 the conduct had occurred within the participating state that issued the
27 qualifying license. The participating state shall apply its own state laws to
28 determine appropriate action.
29 (f) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may
30 recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition of
31 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.

37 state's PA laws and regulations or other applicable state law, any

41 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation
42 initiated under this compact.

SB 126 7
1 PA's compact privilege in all remote states shall be deactivated until two
2 years have elapsed after all restrictions have been removed from the state
3 license. All disciplinary orders by the participating state that issued the
4 qualifying license that impose adverse action against a PA's license shall
5 include a statement that the PA's compact privilege is deactivated in all
6 participating states during the pendency of the order.

23 or responsibilities. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect
24 any such individual from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or

33 that the individual against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis

SB 126 13
1 responsibilities or that such individual had a reasonable basis for believing
2 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
3 responsibilities, if the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result
4 from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that individual.
5 (4) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
6 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
7 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
8 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in
9 any proceedings as authorized by commission rules.
10 (5) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of
11 any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be
12 governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
13 (6) Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or
14 jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional
15 misconduct, negligence or other such civil action pertaining to the practice
16 of a PA. All such matters shall be determined exclusively by state law
17 other than this compact.
18 (7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
19 abrogate a participating state's state action immunity or state action
20 affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman act,
21 Clayton act or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or
22 regulation.
23 (8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
24 sovereign immunity by the participating states or by the commission.
25
26 SECTION 8—DATA SYSTEM
27
28
29 (a) The commission shall provide for the development, maintenance,
30 operation and utilization of a coordinated data and reporting system
31 containing licensure, adverse action and the reporting of the existence of
32 significant investigative information on all licensed PAs and applicants
33 that are denied a license in participating states.
34 (b) Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a
35 participating state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on all
36 PAs to whom this compact is applicable, utilizing a unique identifier, as
37 required by the rules of the commission, including:
38 (1) Identifying information;
39 (2) licensure data;
40 (3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege;
41 (4) any denial of application for licensure and the reason for such
42 denial, excluding the reporting of any criminal history record information
43 where such reporting is prohibited by law;

SB 126 14
1 (5) the existence of significant investigative information; and
2 (6) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
3 compact, as determined by the rules of the commission.
4 (c) Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
5 any participating state shall only be available to other participating states.
6 (d) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states of
7 any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying for a
8 license that has been reported to such commission. Such adverse action
9 information shall be available to any other participating state.
10 (e) Participating states contributing information to the data system
11 may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that
12 shall not be shared with the public without the express permission of the
13 contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such information
14 shall be reported to the commission through the data system.
15 (f) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently
16 expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the participating state
17 contributing the information shall be removed from the data system upon
18 reporting of such by the participating state to the commission.
19 (g) The records and information provided to a participating state
20 pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when certified by the
21 commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business
22 records of the commission and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay
23 exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative
24 proceedings in a participating state.
25
26 SECTION 9—RULEMAKING
27
28
29 (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
30 the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.
31 Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
32 commission for each rule.
33 (b) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to
34 effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and
35 achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and have no force
36 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is
37 invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
38 manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, the
39 powers granted hereunder or based upon another applicable standard of
40 review.
41 (c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
42 participating state, except that where the rules of the commission conflict
43 with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical services, a

SB 126 15
1 PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent
2 jurisdiction, and the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that
3 state to the extent of the conflict.
4 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a
5 commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
6 manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date of
7 adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
8 any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the
9 compact.
10 (e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting
11 of the commission.
12 (f) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule by the
13 commission and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the
14 rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice
15 of proposed rulemaking:
16 (1) On the commission's website or other publicly accessible
17 platform;
18 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices
19 of proposed rulemaking; and
20 (3) in such other ways as the commission may specify by rule.
21 (g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
22 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing on the proposed
23 rule and the proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the
24 proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
25 (2) the text of and the reason for the proposed rule;
26 (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
27 person and the date by which written comments must be received; and
28 (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the
29 commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or provide any
30 written comments.
31 (h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow
32 persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall
33 be made available to the public.
34 (i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission
35 shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.
36 (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed in
37 the notice of proposed rulemaking published not less than five business
38 days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the commission of
39 their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
40 (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner that provides each
41 person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to
42 comment orally or in writing.
43 (3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the

SB 126 16
1 written comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments received in
2 response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person
3 upon request.
4 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
5 hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the
6 convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
7 (j) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all
8 written and oral comments timely received.
9 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final
10 action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the
11 rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the
12 rule.
13 (1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission's website.
14 (2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
15 changes do not expand the original purpose of the proposed rule.
16 (3) The commission shall provide an explanation on its website of the
17 reasons for any substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
18 reasons for any substantive changes not made that were recommended by
19 commenters.
20 (4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
21 the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the
22 effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after the
23 commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
24 (l) Upon the determination that an emergency exists, the commission
25 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours' prior notice,
26 without the opportunity for comment or hearing, expect that the usual
27 rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall
28 be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but in no
29 event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the
30 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that shall be adopted
31 immediately by the commission in order to:
32 (1) Address an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
33 (2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
34 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is
35 established by federal law or rule; or
36 (4) protect public health and safety.
37 (m) The commission, or an authorized committee of the commission,
38 may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission rule for purposes
39 of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency
40 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
41 commission's website. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
42 person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
43 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to

SB 126 17
1 a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and
2 delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
3 challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If
4 the revision is challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the
5 approval of the commission.
6 (n) No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under
7 this compact.
8
9
10 SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
11 ENFORCEMENT
12
13
14 (a) Oversight.
15 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
16 participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary
17 and appropriate to implement the compact.
18 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
19 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
20 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
21 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
22 the extent that it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
23 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
24 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
25 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
26 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
27 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
28 or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a
29 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with
30 service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding
31 void as to the commission, this compact or commission rules.
32 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
33 (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has
34 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
35 this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide
36 written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
37 notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default
38 and any other action that the commission may take and shall offer remedial
39 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
40 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
41 may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a
42 majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
43 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be

SB 126 18
1 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default shall
2 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
3 the period of default.
4 (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed only
5 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
6 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
7 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
8 legislature and to the licensing board of each of the participating states.
9 (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
10 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
11 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
12 termination.
13 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
14 found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact,
15 unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting
16 state.
17 (6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact
18 by the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the
19 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
20 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such
21 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
22 (7) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the
23 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of
24 such termination:
25 (A) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that
26 state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the effective
27 date of such termination; and
28 (B) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a
29 compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege
30 for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a
31 participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state
32 before the 180-day period ends, in which case, the compact privilege shall
33 continue.
34 (c) Dispute resolution.
35 (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall
36 attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among
37 participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
38 (2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
39 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
40 (d) Enforcement.
41 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
42 enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the commission.
43 (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance

SB 126 19
1 have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may initiate legal
2 action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
3 federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a
4 participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
5 this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws. The
6 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
7 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
8 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
9 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
10 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
11 under federal or state law.
12 (e) Legal action against the commission.
13 (1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the
14 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
15 or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to
16 enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The
17 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
18 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
19 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
20 (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this
21 compact against the commission.
22
23 SECTION 11—DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA
24 LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
25
26
27 (a) This compact shall come into effect on the date that this compact
28 statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
29 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission
30 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted
31 the compact prior to the commission convening, called charter-
32 participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such
33 charter-participating state is materially different than the model compact.
34 (A) A charter-participating state whose enactment is found to be
35 materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default
36 process set forth in section 10(b).
37 (B) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its
38 participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence and
39 the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating
40 states should be fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the
41 compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be subject to the
42 process set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are
43 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for

SB 126 20
1 participation in the compact.
2 (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
3 initial charter-participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in
4 section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
5 from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the
6 compact.
7 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
8 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
9 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence
10 shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
11 repudiated by the commission.
12 (b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the
13 commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that this compact
14 becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by
15 the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day that
16 this compact becomes law in that state.
17 (c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by
18 enacting a statute repealing the same.
19 (1) A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
20 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During the 180-day period,
21 all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were
22 granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in
23 effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in
24 another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
25 within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating
26 states shall not be affected by the passage of the 180 days.
27 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state
28 licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative
29 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
30 effective date of withdrawal.
31 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this
32 compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to
33 all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to
34 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of
35 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
36 (d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
37 or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
38 between participating states and between a participating state and
39 nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this
40 compact.
41 (e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No
42 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
43 participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the

SB 126 21
1 laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
2
3 SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
4
5 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be
6 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation
7 and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
8 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to
9 limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
10 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any
11 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
12 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
13 participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
14 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
15 person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
16 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and
17 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
18 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
19 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or subsection
20 (b), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or, in
21 accordance with the requirements of section 10(b), terminate a
22 participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
23 constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with
24 respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure
25 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary
26 to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in
27 full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full
28 force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable
29 matters.
30
31 SECTION 13—BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
32
33
34 (a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
35 participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
36 (b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are
37 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
38 (c) All agreements between the commission and the participating
39 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
40 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
41 publication in the statute book.
