28 office shall consider if:

11 collect a fee of not to exceed $250.
12 (5) An applicant shall file a separate application for each innovative
13 offering that the applicant seeks to demonstrate.

15 applicant shall be confidential and privileged, except that the application
16 and related information may be disclosed to an expert contracted by the
17 division for specific services to review the records.
18 (2) Except as provided in paragraph 1, the application and any related
19 information provided by the applicant shall be confidential and privileged
20 and not be subject to the provisions of the Kansas open records act as
21 provided by K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., and amendments thereto. The
22 provisions of this subsection shall expire on July 1, 2030, unless the
23 legislature reviews and reenacts this provision pursuant to K.S.A. 45-229,
24 and amendments thereto, prior to July 1, 2030.
25 (d) After an application is filed, the regulatory relief office shall:

28 and
29 (2) seek any other information from the applicant that the regulatory
30 relief office determines is necessary for an application to be complete.
31 (e) Not later than five business days after the day when a complete
32 application is received, the regulatory relief office shall:

42 (A) Describe any identifiable, likely and significant harm to the
43 health, safety or financial well-being of consumers against which the

3 application either be admitted or denied entrance into the general
4 regulatory sandbox program.
5 (2) The applicable agency may request an additional five business
6 days to deliver the written report by providing notice to the director. Such
7 request shall automatically be granted, and the applicable agency may only
8 request one extension per application.
9 (3) If the applicable agency recommends that an application should
10 be denied entrance into the general regulatory sandbox program, the
11 written report shall include a description of the reasons for the
12 recommendation, including why a temporary waiver or suspension of the
13 relevant rules and regulations is likely to significantly harm the health,
14 safety or financial well-being of consumers or the public and the
15 likelihood of such harm occurring.
16 (4) If the agency determines that the consumer's or public's health,
17 safety or financial well-being can be protected through less restrictive
18 means than the existing relevant rules and regulations, the applicable
19 agency shall provide a recommendation of how such less restrictive means
20 can be achieved.
21 (5) If an applicable agency fails to deliver a written report as
22 described in this section, the director shall assume that the applicable
23 agency does not object to the temporary waiver or suspension of the
24 relevant rules and regulations for the application seeking to participate in
25 the general regulatory sandbox program.
26 (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an applicable
27 agency may:
28 (A) By written notice to the regulatory relief office not more than 30
29 days after the date when the applicable agency receives a completed
30 application for review, or within 35 days if an extension has been
31 requested by the applicable agency, reject an application if the applicable
32 agency determines, in the applicable agency's sole discretion, that the
33 applicant's offering fails to comply with standards or specifications
34 required by federal law or regulation or previously approved for use by a
35 federal agency; or
36 (B) reject an application preliminarily approved by the regulatory
37 relief office, if the applicable agency recommended rejection of the
38 application in the agency's written report and provides in the written notice
39 under subparagraph (A) a description of the applicable agency's reasons
40 why approval of the application would create a substantial risk of harm to
41 the health or safety of the public or create unreasonable expenses for
42 taxpayers in the state.
43 (7) If an applicable agency rejects an application under paragraph (6),

HB 2291 7
1 the regulatory relief office shall not approve such application.
2 (g) (1) Upon receiving a written report, the director shall provide the
3 application and the written report to the advisory committee.
4 (2) The director may call the advisory committee to meet, as needed,
5 but not less than once per quarter if applications are available for review.
6 (3) After receiving and reviewing the application and each written
7 report, the advisory committee shall provide to the director the advisory
8 committee's recommendation as to whether or not the applicant should be
9 admitted as a sandbox participant under this section.
10 (4) As part of the advisory committee's review of each written report,
11 the advisory committee shall use the criteria required for an applicable
12 agency as described in subsection (f).
13 (h) (1) In reviewing an application and each applicable agency's
14 written report, the regulatory relief office shall consult with each
15 applicable agency and the advisory committee before admitting an
16 applicant into the general regulatory sandbox program. Such consultation
17 may seek information regarding whether the applicable agency has
18 previously:
19 (A) Issued a license or other authorization to the applicant; and
20 (B) investigated, sanctioned or pursued legal action against the
21 applicant.
22 (2) In reviewing an application, if a competitor to an applicant is or
23 has been a regulatory relief sandbox program participant, the regulatory
24 relief office and each applicable agency shall weigh such competitor's
25 participation as a factor in favor of allowing the applicant to also become a
26 sandbox participant.
27 (i) In reviewing an application under this section, the regulatory relief
28 office shall consider if:
29 (1) The applicant's plan will adequately protect consumers from
30 potential harm identified by an applicable agency in the written report;
31 (2) the risk of harm to consumers is outweighed by the potential
32 benefits to consumers from the applicant's participation in the general
33 regulatory sandbox program; and
34 (3) certain rules and regulations that regulate an offering should not
35 be waived or suspended even if the applicant is approved as a sandbox
36 participant, including applicable anti-fraud or disclosure provisions.
37 (j) An applicant becomes a sandbox participant if the regulatory relief
38 office approves the application and enters into a written agreement with
39 the applicant describing the specific rules and regulations that are waived
40 or suspended as part of participation in the general regulatory sandbox
41 program.
42 (1) The regulatory relief office shall not enter into a written
43 agreement with an applicant that waives or suspends a tax, fee or charge

HB 2291 8
1 that is administered under the provisions of chapter 79 of the Kansas
2 Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
3 (2) The director may deny any application submitted under this
4 section for any reason, including if the director determines that suspending
5 or waiving enforcement of rule and regulation would cause a significant
6 risk of harm to consumers or residents of the state.
7 (3) (A) If the director denies an application, the regulatory relief
8 office shall provide to the applicant a written description of the reasons for
9 not allowing the applicant to be a sandbox participant.
10 (B) The denial of an application submitted under this section shall not
11 be subject to the administrative procedure act or the Kansas judicial review
12 act.
13 (C) The director shall deny an application for participation in the
14 general regulatory sandbox program described by this section if the
15 applicant or any person who seeks to participate with the applicant, in
16 demonstrating that an offering has been convicted, entered a plea of nolo
17 contendere for any crime involving significant theft, fraud or dishonesty if
18 the crime bears a significant relationship to the applicant's or other
19 participant's ability to safely and competently participate in the general
20 regulatory sandbox program.
21 (4) When an applicant is approved for participation in the general
22 regulatory sandbox program, the director may provide notice of the
23 approval to competitors of the applicant and to the public.
24 New Sec. 4. (a) If the regulatory relief office approves an application
25 under sections 1 through 3, and amendments thereto, the sandbox
