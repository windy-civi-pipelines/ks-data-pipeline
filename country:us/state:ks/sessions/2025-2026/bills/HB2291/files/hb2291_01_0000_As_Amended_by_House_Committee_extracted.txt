HB 2291—Am. by HC 7
1 days after the date when the applicable agency receives a completed
2 application for review, or within 35 days if an extension has been
3 requested by the applicable agency, reject an application if the applicable
4 agency determines, in the applicable agency's sole discretion, that the
5 applicant's offering fails to comply with standards or specifications
6 required by federal law or regulation or previously approved for use by a
7 federal agency; or
8 (B) reject an application preliminarily approved by the regulatory
9 relief office, if the applicable agency recommended rejection of the
10 application in the agency's written report and provides in the written notice
11 under subparagraph (A) a description of the applicable agency's reasons
12 why approval of the application would create a substantial risk of harm to
13 the health or safety of the public or create unreasonable expenses for
14 taxpayers in the state.
15 (7) If an applicable agency rejects an application under paragraph (6),
16 the regulatory relief office shall not approve such application unless the
17 advisory committee recommends that the application should be
18 approved by a 2/ vote.
3
19 (g) (1) Upon receiving a written report, the director shall provide the
20 application and the written report to the advisory committee.

24 report, the advisory committee shall provide to the director the advisory
25 committee's recommendation as to whether or not the applicant should be
26 admitted as a sandbox participant under this section.
27 (4) As part of the advisory committee's review of each written report,
28 the advisory committee shall use the criteria required for an applicable
29 agency as described in subsection (f).
30 (h) (1) In reviewing an application and each applicable agency's
31 written report, the regulatory relief office shall consult with each
32 applicable agency and the advisory committee before admitting an
33 applicant into the general regulatory sandbox program. Such consultation
34 may seek information regarding whether the applicable agency has
35 previously:
36 (A) Issued a license or other authorization to the applicant; and
37 (B) investigated, sanctioned or pursued legal action against the
38 applicant.

37 regulatory sandbox program.

39 regulatory sandbox program, the director may shall provide notice of the
