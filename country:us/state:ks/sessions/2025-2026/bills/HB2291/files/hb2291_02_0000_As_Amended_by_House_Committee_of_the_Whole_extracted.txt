7 days after the date when the applicable agency receives a completed

12 required by federal law or regulation or previously approved for use by a
13 federal agency; or

22 the regulatory relief office shall not approve such application unless the
23 advisory committee recommends that the application should be
24 approved by a 2/ vote.
3
25 (g) (1) Upon receiving a written report, the director shall provide the

30 report, the advisory committee shall provide to the director the advisory
31 committee's recommendation as to whether or not the applicant should be
