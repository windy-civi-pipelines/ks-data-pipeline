3 (vvvv) (1) all sales of tangible personal property or services
4 purchased by the Kansas fairgrounds foundation, a not-for-profit
5 corporation exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to section
6 501(c)(3) of the federal internal revenue code, and which such property
7 and services are used for the purpose of constructing, equipping,
8 reconstructing, maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or
9 remodeling a building that is operated by, or is intended to be operated by
10 the Kansas fairgrounds foundation and located on the grounds of the
11 Kansas state fair, and all sales of tangible personal property or services
12 purchased by a contractor for the purpose of constructing, equipping,
13 reconstructing, maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling
14 a building that is operated by, or is intended to be operated by, the Kansas
15 fairgrounds foundation, a not-for-profit corporation exempt from federal
16 income taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the federal internal
17 revenue code of 1986, and located on the grounds of the Kansas state fair,
18 and such tangible personal property or service would be exempt from
19 taxation under the provisions of this paragraph if purchased directly by
20 such eligible not-for-profit corporation. Nothing in this subsection shall be
21 deemed to exempt the purchase of any construction machinery, equipment
22 or tools used in the constructing, equipping, reconstructing, maintaining,
23 repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling a building for such eligible
24 not-for-profit corporation. When such eligible not-for-profit corporation
25 contracts for the purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing,
26 maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling a building,
27 such corporation shall obtain from the state and furnish to the contractor
28 an exemption certificate for the project involved, and such contractor may
29 purchase materials for incorporation in such project. The contractor shall
30 furnish the number of such certificate to all suppliers from whom such

36 subsection. All invoices shall be held by the contractor for a period of five
37 years and shall be subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any
38 materials purchased under such a certificate are found not to have been
39 incorporated in the building or returned for credit, the contractor shall
40 report and pay the sales or compensating tax to the director of taxation not
41 later than the 20th day of the month following the close of the month in
42 which it is determined that such materials will not be used for the purpose
43 for which such certificate was issued. The eligible not-for-profit
SB 267 55
1 corporation concerned shall be liable for tax on all materials purchased for
2 the project, and upon payment thereof, the eligible not-for-profit
3 corporation may recover the same from the contractor together with
4 reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or any agent, employee or
5 subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise dispose of any materials
6 purchased under such a certificate for any purpose other than that for
7 which such a certificate is issued without the payment of the sales or
8 compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials shall be guilty of
9 a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be subject to the
10 penalties provided for in K.S.A. 79-3615(h), and amendments thereto.
11 (2) Sales tax paid on and after May 19, 2023, but prior to the effective
12 date of this act upon the gross receipts received from any sale which would
13 have been exempted by the provisions of this subsection had such sale
14 occurred after the effective date of this act shall be refunded. Each claim
15 for a sales tax refund shall be verified and submitted to the director of
16 taxation upon forms furnished by the director and shall be accompanied by
17 any additional documentation required by the director. The director shall
18 review each claim and shall refund that amount of sales tax paid as

SB 267 54
1 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall expire and have no effect
2 on and after July 1, 2029;
3 (vvvv) (1) all sales of tangible personal property or services
4 purchased by the Kansas fairgrounds foundation, a not-for-profit
5 corporation exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to section
6 501(c)(3) of the federal internal revenue code, and which such property
7 and services are used for the purpose of constructing, equipping,
8 reconstructing, maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or
9 remodeling a building that is operated by, or is intended to be operated by
10 the Kansas fairgrounds foundation and located on the grounds of the
11 Kansas state fair, and all sales of tangible personal property or services
12 purchased by a contractor for the purpose of constructing, equipping,
13 reconstructing, maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling
14 a building that is operated by, or is intended to be operated by, the Kansas
15 fairgrounds foundation, a not-for-profit corporation exempt from federal
16 income taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the federal internal
17 revenue code of 1986, and located on the grounds of the Kansas state fair,
18 and such tangible personal property or service would be exempt from
19 taxation under the provisions of this paragraph if purchased directly by
20 such eligible not-for-profit corporation. Nothing in this subsection shall be
21 deemed to exempt the purchase of any construction machinery, equipment
22 or tools used in the constructing, equipping, reconstructing, maintaining,
23 repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling a building for such eligible
24 not-for-profit corporation. When such eligible not-for-profit corporation
25 contracts for the purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing,
26 maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling a building,
27 such corporation shall obtain from the state and furnish to the contractor
28 an exemption certificate for the project involved, and such contractor may
29 purchase materials for incorporation in such project. The contractor shall
30 furnish the number of such certificate to all suppliers from whom such
31 purchases are made, and such suppliers shall execute invoices covering
32 such purchases bearing the number of such certificate. Upon completion of
33 the project, the contractor shall furnish to such eligible not-for-profit
34 corporation a sworn statement, on a form to be provided by the director of
35 taxation, that all purchases so made were entitled to exemption under this
36 subsection. All invoices shall be held by the contractor for a period of five
37 years and shall be subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any
38 materials purchased under such a certificate are found not to have been
39 incorporated in the building or returned for credit, the contractor shall
40 report and pay the sales or compensating tax to the director of taxation not
41 later than the 20th day of the month following the close of the month in
42 which it is determined that such materials will not be used for the purpose
43 for which such certificate was issued. The eligible not-for-profit

SB 267 55
1 corporation concerned shall be liable for tax on all materials purchased for
2 the project, and upon payment thereof, the eligible not-for-profit
3 corporation may recover the same from the contractor together with
4 reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or any agent, employee or
5 subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise dispose of any materials
6 purchased under such a certificate for any purpose other than that for
7 which such a certificate is issued without the payment of the sales or
8 compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials shall be guilty of
9 a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be subject to the
10 penalties provided for in K.S.A. 79-3615(h), and amendments thereto.
11 (2) Sales tax paid on and after May 19, 2023, but prior to the effective
12 date of this act upon the gross receipts received from any sale which would
13 have been exempted by the provisions of this subsection had such sale
14 occurred after the effective date of this act shall be refunded. Each claim
15 for a sales tax refund shall be verified and submitted to the director of
16 taxation upon forms furnished by the director and shall be accompanied by
17 any additional documentation required by the director. The director shall
18 review each claim and shall refund that amount of sales tax paid as
19 determined under the provisions of this subsection. All refunds shall be
20 paid from the sales tax refund fund upon warrants of the director of
21 accounts and reports pursuant to vouchers approved by the director or the
22 director's designee; and
23 (wwww) (1) all sales of tangible personal property or services
24 purchased by a pregnancy resource center or residential maternity facility.
25 (2) As used in this subsection, "pregnancy resource center" or
26 "residential maternity facility" means an organization that is:
27 (A) Exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to section 501(c)
28 (3) of the federal internal revenue code of 1986;
29 (B) a nonprofit organization organized under the laws of this state;
30 and
31 (C) a pregnancy resource center or residential maternity facility that:
32 (i) Maintains a dedicated phone number for clients;
33 (ii) maintains in this state its primary physical office, clinic or
34 residential home that is open for clients for a minimum of 20 hours per

36 (iii) offers services, at no cost to the client, for the express purpose of
37 providing assistance to women in order to carry their pregnancy to term,
38 encourage parenting or adoption, prevent abortion and promote healthy
39 childbirth; and
40 (iv) utilizes trained healthcare providers, as defined by K.S.A. 2024
41 Supp. 79-32,316, and amendments thereto, to perform any available
42 medical procedures.
43 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-3602 and 79-3606 are hereby repealed.
