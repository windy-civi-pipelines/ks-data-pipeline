Session of 2025
Substitute for SENATE BILL No. 33
By Committee on Assessment and Taxation
2-3
1 AN ACT concerning sales taxation; relating to exemptions; excluding
2 exempt sales of certain custom meat processing services from
3 exemption certificate requirements; amending K.S.A. 79-3651 and
4 repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 79-3651 is hereby amended to read as follows: 79-
8 3651. (a) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Kansas
9 retailers' sales tax act and to prevent evasion of the tax imposed
10 thereunder, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts from the sale of
11 tangible personal property or enumerated services are subject to tax until
12 the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale is not subject
13 to tax is upon the seller unless the seller takes from the purchaser an
14 exemption certificate to the effect that the property or service purchased is
15 not subject to tax.
16 (b) An exemption certificate shall relieve the seller from collecting
17 and remitting tax if the seller has obtained the required identifying
18 information as determined by the director, from the purchaser and the
19 reason for claiming the exemption at the time of purchase and has
20 maintained proper records of exempt transactions pursuant to subsection
21 (a) of K.S.A. 79-3609(a), and amendments thereto, and provided them to
22 the director when requested, except that no such relief from liability shall
23 apply to a seller who: Fraudulently fails to collect the tax; solicits
24 purchasers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption; accepts an
25 exemption certificate claiming an entity based exemption when the subject
26 of the transaction is actually received by the purchaser at a location
27 operated by the seller and the director provides an exemption certificate
28 that clearly and affirmatively indicates that the claimed exemption is not
29 available. The seller shall obtain the same information for proof of a
30 claimed exemption regardless of the medium in which the transaction
31 occurred. The purchaser improperly claiming an exemption shall remain
32 liable for the nonpayment of tax.
33 (c) The exemption certificate shall be substantially in such form as
34 the director may prescribe. The seller shall use the standard form for
35 claiming an exemption electronically as adopted by the director. A seller
36 may require a purchaser to provide a copy of the purchaser's sales tax

Sub SB 33 2
1 registration certificate with a resale certificate as a condition for honoring
2 the purchaser's resale exemption claim, except that in the case of drop
3 shipment sales into this state, the third party vendor may claim a resale
4 exemption based on an exemption certificate provided by its customer, re-
5 seller, or any other information acceptable to the secretary available to the
6 third party vendor evidencing qualification for a resale exemption,
7 regardless of whether the customer, re-seller, is registered to collect and
8 remit sales and use tax in this state. A purchaser is not required to provide
9 a signature to claim an exemption from tax unless a paper exemption
10 certificate is used. A seller is relieved of liability for the tax otherwise
11 applicable if it obtains a blanket exemption certificate for a purchaser with
12 which the seller has a recurring business relationship. Such blanket
13 certificate need not be renewed or updated by the seller for exemption
14 certificate information or data elements when there is a recurring business
15 relationship between the buyer and seller. For purposes of this subsection,
16 a recurring business relationship exists when a period of no more than 12
17 months elapses between sales transactions.
18 (d) To lawfully present a resale exemption certificate the purchaser
19 must be engaged in the business of selling property or services of the same
20 kind that is purchased, hold a registration certificate, except as otherwise
21 permitted in subsection (c) for drop shipment sales into this state, and at
22 the time of purchase, either intend to resell the property in the regular
23 course of business or be unable to ascertain whether the property will be
24 resold or used for some other purpose. A resale exemption certificate may
25 be used for resale of services to tangible personal property and not for
26 services to real property.
27 (e) Any person who issues a resale certificate or other exemption
28 certificate in order to unlawfully avoid payment of tax for business or
29 personal gain shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall
30 be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not
31 more than one year, or by both. In addition, if the director determines that
32 a person issued a resale certificate in order to unlawfully avoid payment of
33 tax for business or personal gain, the director shall increase any penalty
34 that is due from the person under K.S.A. 79-3615, and amendments
35 thereto, by $250 or 10 times the tax due, whichever is greater, on each
36 transaction where the misuse of a resale certificate occurred.
37 (f) Exemption certificates issued by an entity claiming a specific
38 exemption under K.S.A. 79-3606, and amendments thereto, based on the
39 status of the entity shall bear the name, address of the entity and
40 identification number issued to the entity pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3692, and
41 amendments thereto. Such certificate shall be signed by an authorized
42 person of the nonprofit entity, if in paper form, and contain the tax
43 identification number of the entity. The certificate shall be substantially in

Sub SB 33 3
1 such form as the director may prescribe. A seller may require that
2 payments be made on an exempt entity's check, warrant, voucher or
3 charged to the entity's account as a condition for honoring the entity's
4 exemption claim.
5 (g) It shall be the duty of every person who purchases tangible
6 personal property or services that are taxable under this act to pay the full
7 amount of tax that is lawfully due to the retailer making the sale. Any
8 person who willfully and intentionally refuses to pay such tax to the
9 retailer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be
10 punished and fined as provided by subsection (g) of K.S.A. 79-3615(h),
11 and amendments thereto.
12 (h) On and after July 1, 2024, notwithstanding any provisions to the
13 contrary in this section or any other provision of law, purchasers claiming
14 an exemption pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3606(rrrr), and amendments thereto,
15 shall not be required to provide an exemption certificate or form to the
16 seller, and the seller shall not be required to receive and maintain a
17 completed exemption certificate or form for such exempt transactions. If
18 the seller in the ordinary course of business believes that the service
19 qualifies for the exemption pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3606(rrrr), and
20 amendments thereto, the seller shall be relieved from collecting and
21 remitting the tax and shall not have the burden of proving that the service
22 is not subject to tax pursuant to subsection (a). A purchaser improperly
23 claiming the exemption shall remain liable for the nonpayment of tax.
24 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 79-3651 is hereby repealed.
25 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
26 publication in the statute book.
