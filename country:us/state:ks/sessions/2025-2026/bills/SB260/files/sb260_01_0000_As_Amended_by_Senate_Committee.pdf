35 the grant of a license to one of two or more competing applicants
36 without the necessity of a hearing on the denial of a license to each
37 other competing applicant. Any action for judicial review of such
38 decision shall be by appeal to the supreme court in accordance with the
39 Kansas judicial review act, except that the scope of review shall be
40 limited to whether the action of the commission was arbitrary or
41 capricious or constituted an abuse of discretion. All competing

SB 260—Am. by SC 11
1 cases except those having statutory priority.
