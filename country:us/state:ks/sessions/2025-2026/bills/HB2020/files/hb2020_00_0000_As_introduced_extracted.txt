15 from the voter registration rolls that the person may be reinstated on the
16 voter registration rolls by providing proof of their citizenship.
17 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 8-240 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-240. (a)
18 (1) Every application for an instruction permit shall be made upon a form
19 furnished by the division of vehicles and accompanied by a fee of $2 for
20 class A, B, C or M and $5 for all commercial classes. Every other
21 application shall be made upon a form furnished by the division and
22 accompanied by an examination fee of $3, unless a different fee is required
23 by K.S.A. 8-241, and amendments thereto, and by the proper fee for the
24 license for which the application is made. All commercial class applicants
25 shall be charged a $15 driving test fee for the drive test portion of the
26 commercial driver's license application. If the applicant is not required to
27 take an examination or the commercial license drive test, the examination
28 or commercial drive test fee shall not be required. The examination shall
29 consist of three tests, as follows: (A) Vision; (B) written; and (C) driving.
30 For a commercial driver's license, the drive test shall consist of three
31 components, as follows: (A) Pre-trip; (B) skills test; and (C) road test. If
32 the applicant fails the vision test, the applicant may have correction of
33 vision made and take the vision test again without any additional fee. If an
34 applicant fails the written test, the applicant may take such test again upon
35 the payment of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant fails
HB 2020 2
1 the driving test, the applicant may take such test again upon the payment
2 of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant for a commercial
3 driver's license fails any portion of the commercial drive test, the applicant
4 may take such test again upon the payment of an additional drive test fee
5 of $10. If an applicant fails to pass all three of the tests within a period of
6 six months from the date of original application and desires to take
7 additional tests, the applicant shall file an application for reexamination
8 upon a form furnished by the division, which shall be accompanied by a
9 reexamination fee of $3, except that any applicant who fails to pass the
10 written or driving portion of an examination four times within a six-month
11 period, shall be required to wait a period of six months from the date of the
12 last failed examination before additional examinations may be given.
13 Upon the filing of such application and the payment of such reexamination
14 fee, the applicant shall be entitled to reexamination in like manner and
15 subject to the additional fees and time limitation as provided for
16 examination on an original application. If the applicant passes the
17 reexamination, the applicant shall be issued the classified driver's license
18 for which the applicant originally applied, which license shall be issued to
19 expire as if the applicant had passed the original examination.
20 (2) Applicants for class M licenses who have completed prior
