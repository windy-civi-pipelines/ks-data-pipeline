5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 New Section 1. The director of the division of motor vehicles shall
8 provide a list of all permanent and temporary drivers' licenses issued to
9 noncitizens quarterly and forward this list to the secretary of state. The list
10 of noncitizens shall contain the names, addresses, phone numbers, social
11 security numbers, dates of birth, alien registration numbers, temporary
12 drivers' license numbers and expiration dates of such licenses. The
13 secretary of state shall compare such lists with the voter registration rolls

15 remove within five business days any names of noncitizens that appear
16 on the voter rolls. The secretary of state county election officer shall
17 notify any person removed from the voter registration rolls that the person
18 may be reinstated on the voter registration rolls by providing proof of their
19 citizenship.
20 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 8-240 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-240. (a)
21 (1) Every application for an instruction permit shall be made upon a form
22 furnished by the division of vehicles and accompanied by a fee of $2 for
23 class A, B, C or M and $5 for all commercial classes. Every other
24 application shall be made upon a form furnished by the division and
25 accompanied by an examination fee of $3, unless a different fee is required
26 by K.S.A. 8-241, and amendments thereto, and by the proper fee for the
27 license for which the application is made. All commercial class applicants
28 shall be charged a $15 driving test fee for the drive test portion of the
29 commercial driver's license application. If the applicant is not required to
30 take an examination or the commercial license drive test, the examination
31 or commercial drive test fee shall not be required. The examination shall
32 consist of three tests, as follows: (A) Vision; (B) written; and (C) driving.
33 For a commercial driver's license, the drive test shall consist of three
34 components, as follows: (A) Pre-trip; (B) skills test; and (C) road test. If

HB 2020—Am. by SC 2
1 the applicant fails the vision test, the applicant may have correction of
2 vision made and take the vision test again without any additional fee. If an
3 applicant fails the written test, the applicant may take such test again upon
4 the payment of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant fails
5 the driving test, the applicant may take such test again upon the payment
6 of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant for a commercial
7 driver's license fails any portion of the commercial drive test, the applicant
8 may take such test again upon the payment of an additional drive test fee
9 of $10. If an applicant fails to pass all three of the tests within a period of
10 six months from the date of original application and desires to take
11 additional tests, the applicant shall file an application for reexamination
12 upon a form furnished by the division, which shall be accompanied by a
13 reexamination fee of $3, except that any applicant who fails to pass the
14 written or driving portion of an examination four times within a six-month
15 period, shall be required to wait a period of six months from the date of the
16 last failed examination before additional examinations may be given.
17 Upon the filing of such application and the payment of such reexamination
18 fee, the applicant shall be entitled to reexamination in like manner and
19 subject to the additional fees and time limitation as provided for
20 examination on an original application. If the applicant passes the
21 reexamination, the applicant shall be issued the classified driver's license
22 for which the applicant originally applied, which license shall be issued to
23 expire as if the applicant had passed the original examination.
24 (2) Applicants for class M licenses who have completed prior
25 motorcycle safety training in accordance with department of defense
26 instruction 6055.04 (DoDI 6055.04) or the motorcycle safety foundation
27 are not required to complete further written and driving testing pursuant to
28 paragraph (1). An applicant seeking exemption from the written and
29 driving tests pursuant to this paragraph shall provide a copy of the
30 motorcycle safety foundation completion form to the division prior to
31 receiving a class M license.
32 (3) On and after January 1, 2017, an applicant for a class M license
33 who passes a driving examination on a three-wheeled motorcycle that is
34 not an autocycle shall have a restriction placed on such applicant's license
35 limiting the applicant to the operation of a registered three-wheeled
36 motorcycle. An applicant for a class M license who passes a driving
37 examination on a two-wheeled motorcycle may operate any registered
38 two-wheeled or three-wheeled motorcycle. The driving examination
39 required by this paragraph shall be administered by the division, by the
40 department of defense or as part of a curriculum recognized by the
41 motorcycle safety foundation.
42 (b) (1) For the purposes of obtaining any driver's license or
43 instruction permit, an applicant shall submit, with the application, proof of

HB 2020—Am. by SC 3
1 age and proof of identity as the division may require. The applicant also
2 shall provide a photo identity document, except that a non-photo identity
3 document is acceptable if it includes both the applicant's full legal name
4 and date of birth, and documentation showing the applicant's name, the
5 applicant's address of principal residence and the applicant's social security
6 number. The applicant's social security number shall remain confidential
7 and shall not be disclosed, except as provided pursuant to K.S.A. 74-2012,
8 and amendments thereto. If the applicant does not have a social security
9 number, the applicant shall provide proof of lawful presence and Kansas
10 residency. The division shall assign a distinguishing number to the license
11 or permit.
12 (2) The division shall not issue any driver's license or instruction
13 permit to any person who fails to provide proof that the person is lawfully
14 present in the United States. Before issuing a driver's license or instruction
15 permit to a person, the division shall require valid documentary evidence
16 that the applicant: (A) Is a citizen or national of the United States; (B) is an
17 alien lawfully admitted for permanent or temporary residence in the

34 States or, if there is no definite end to the period of authorized stay, a
35 period of one year; (B) a driver's license issued pursuant to this
36 subparagraph shall clearly indicate that it is temporary and shall state the
37 date on which it expires; (C) no driver's license issued pursuant to this

39 permitted by K.S.A. 8-247(a), and amendments thereto; and (D) a driver's
40 license issued pursuant to this subparagraph may be renewed, subject at
41 the time of renewal, to the same requirements and conditions as set out in
42 this subsection (b) for the issuance of the original driver's license.

10 gender and address of principal residence of the applicant, and briefly
11 describe the applicant, and shall state whether the applicant has been
12 licensed as a driver prior to such application, and, if so, when and by what
13 state or country. Such application shall state whether any such license has
14 ever been suspended or revoked, or whether an application has ever been
15 refused, and, if so, the date of and reason for such suspension, revocation
16 or refusal. In addition, applications for commercial drivers' licenses and
