1 AN ACT concerning driver's licenses of noncitizens; requiring the director
2 of the division of motor vehicles to make monthly quarterly reports of
3 names and addresses of noncitizens to the secretary of state; amending
4 K.S.A. 8-240 and repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 New Section 1. The director of the division of motor vehicles shall
8 provide a list of all permanent and temporary drivers' licenses issued to
9 noncitizens quarterly and forward this list to the secretary of state. The list
10 of noncitizens shall contain the names, addresses, phone numbers, social
11 security numbers, dates of birth, alien registration numbers, temporary
12 drivers' license numbers and expiration dates of such licenses. The
13 secretary of state shall compare such lists with the voter registration rolls
14 and delete, after an investigation, direct the county election officer to
15 remove within five business days any names of noncitizens that appear
16 on the voter rolls. The secretary of state county election officer shall
17 notify any person removed from the voter registration rolls that the person
18 may be reinstated on the voter registration rolls by providing proof of their
19 citizenship.
20 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 8-240 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-240. (a)
21 (1) Every application for an instruction permit shall be made upon a form
22 furnished by the division of vehicles and accompanied by a fee of $2 for
23 class A, B, C or M and $5 for all commercial classes. Every other
24 application shall be made upon a form furnished by the division and
25 accompanied by an examination fee of $3, unless a different fee is required
26 by K.S.A. 8-241, and amendments thereto, and by the proper fee for the
27 license for which the application is made. All commercial class applicants
28 shall be charged a $15 driving test fee for the drive test portion of the
29 commercial driver's license application. If the applicant is not required to
30 take an examination or the commercial license drive test, the examination
31 or commercial drive test fee shall not be required. The examination shall
32 consist of three tests, as follows: (A) Vision; (B) written; and (C) driving.
33 For a commercial driver's license, the drive test shall consist of three
34 components, as follows: (A) Pre-trip; (B) skills test; and (C) road test. If
35 the applicant fails the vision test, the applicant may have correction of
36 vision made and take the vision test again without any additional fee. If an
HB 2020—Am. by HC 2
1 applicant fails the written test, the applicant may take such test again upon
2 the payment of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant fails
3 the driving test, the applicant may take such test again upon the payment
4 of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant for a commercial
5 driver's license fails any portion of the commercial drive test, the applicant
6 may take such test again upon the payment of an additional drive test fee
7 of $10. If an applicant fails to pass all three of the tests within a period of
8 six months from the date of original application and desires to take
9 additional tests, the applicant shall file an application for reexamination
10 upon a form furnished by the division, which shall be accompanied by a
11 reexamination fee of $3, except that any applicant who fails to pass the
12 written or driving portion of an examination four times within a six-month
13 period, shall be required to wait a period of six months from the date of the
14 last failed examination before additional examinations may be given.
15 Upon the filing of such application and the payment of such reexamination
16 fee, the applicant shall be entitled to reexamination in like manner and
17 subject to the additional fees and time limitation as provided for
18 examination on an original application. If the applicant passes the
19 reexamination, the applicant shall be issued the classified driver's license
20 for which the applicant originally applied, which license shall be issued to
21 expire as if the applicant had passed the original examination.
22 (2) Applicants for class M licenses who have completed prior
23 motorcycle safety training in accordance with department of defense
24 instruction 6055.04 (DoDI 6055.04) or the motorcycle safety foundation
25 are not required to complete further written and driving testing pursuant to
26 paragraph (1). An applicant seeking exemption from the written and
27 driving tests pursuant to this paragraph shall provide a copy of the
28 motorcycle safety foundation completion form to the division prior to
29 receiving a class M license.
30 (3) On and after January 1, 2017, an applicant for a class M license
31 who passes a driving examination on a three-wheeled motorcycle that is
32 not an autocycle shall have a restriction placed on such applicant's license
33 limiting the applicant to the operation of a registered three-wheeled
34 motorcycle. An applicant for a class M license who passes a driving
35 examination on a two-wheeled motorcycle may operate any registered
36 two-wheeled or three-wheeled motorcycle. The driving examination
37 required by this paragraph shall be administered by the division, by the
38 department of defense or as part of a curriculum recognized by the
39 motorcycle safety foundation.
40 (b) (1) For the purposes of obtaining any driver's license or
41 instruction permit, an applicant shall submit, with the application, proof of
42 age and proof of identity as the division may require. The applicant also
43 shall provide a photo identity document, except that a non-photo identity
HB 2020—Am. by HC 3
1 document is acceptable if it includes both the applicant's full legal name
2 and date of birth, and documentation showing the applicant's name, the
3 applicant's address of principal residence and the applicant's social security
4 number. The applicant's social security number shall remain confidential
5 and shall not be disclosed, except as provided pursuant to K.S.A. 74-2012,
6 and amendments thereto. If the applicant does not have a social security
7 number, the applicant shall provide proof of lawful presence and Kansas
8 residency. The division shall assign a distinguishing number to the license
9 or permit.
10 (2) The division shall not issue any driver's license or instruction
11 permit to any person who fails to provide proof that the person is lawfully
12 present in the United States. Before issuing a driver's license or instruction
13 permit to a person, the division shall require valid documentary evidence
14 that the applicant: (A) Is a citizen or national of the United States; (B) is an
15 alien lawfully admitted for permanent or temporary residence in the

19 citizenship.
20 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 8-240 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-240. (a)
21 (1) Every application for an instruction permit shall be made upon a form
22 furnished by the division of vehicles and accompanied by a fee of $2 for
23 class A, B, C or M and $5 for all commercial classes. Every other
24 application shall be made upon a form furnished by the division and
25 accompanied by an examination fee of $3, unless a different fee is required
26 by K.S.A. 8-241, and amendments thereto, and by the proper fee for the
27 license for which the application is made. All commercial class applicants
28 shall be charged a $15 driving test fee for the drive test portion of the

31 or commercial drive test fee shall not be required. The examination shall
32 consist of three tests, as follows: (A) Vision; (B) written; and (C) driving.
33 For a commercial driver's license, the drive test shall consist of three
34 components, as follows: (A) Pre-trip; (B) skills test; and (C) road test. If
35 the applicant fails the vision test, the applicant may have correction of

12 written or driving portion of an examination four times within a six-month
13 period, shall be required to wait a period of six months from the date of the

16 fee, the applicant shall be entitled to reexamination in like manner and
17 subject to the additional fees and time limitation as provided for
18 examination on an original application. If the applicant passes the

20 for which the applicant originally applied, which license shall be issued to
21 expire as if the applicant had passed the original examination.
