6 program and other waiver programs administered by the secretary. The
7 system shall support the generation of waiting list reports and ensure

20 (D) the reduction of errors and enhancement of efficiency in
21 processing applications and other documents and facilitation of timely
22 responses by department staff to user questions; and

24 disabilities and their families on waitlists or participating in waiver
25 programs regarding health or disability service or support needs of such
26 individuals.
