2 (3) The state board of regents is authorized to turn any repayment
3 account arising under this act to a designated loan servicer or collection

5 only be to receive payments from the loan servicer or collection agency at
6 the interest rate prescribed under this subsection in section 1, and
7 amendments thereto.

12 (A) Determining whether or not a student satisfied the requirements
13 of this act and the agreement entered into pursuant to this section; and

21 grant award completes the program of study for which the student received
22 the grant or has exhausted the benefits available under this act.

24 considered a contractor of the state nor shall such institutions be required

26 be repaid by a student who fails to satisfy the requirements of an
27 agreement entered into pursuant to this section.
