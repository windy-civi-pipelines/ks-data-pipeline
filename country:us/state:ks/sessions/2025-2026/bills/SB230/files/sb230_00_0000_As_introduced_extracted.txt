31 No person shall receive a driver's license unless and until such person
32 surrenders or with the approval of the division, lists to the division all
33 valid licenses in such person's possession issued to such person by any
34 other jurisdiction. All surrendered licenses, digital proof of drivers'
35 licenses or the information listed on foreign licenses shall be returned by

43 requiring licenses of persons who drive taxicabs or municipally franchised
SB 230 6
1 transit systems for hire upon city streets, to protect the public from drivers
2 whose character or habits make them unfit to transport the public. If a

8 to the clerk of the district court and the matter shall be docketed as any
9 other cause and the applicant shall be granted a trial of such person's
10 character and habits. The matter shall be heard by the court de novo in
11 accordance with the code of civil procedure. The cost of such appeal shall
12 be assessed in such manner as the court may direct.
13 (c) Any person operating in this state a motor vehicle shall be the

20 motor vehicle in any class or classes;
21 (2) is at least 15 years of age and has passed the written and visual

17 accessed using a computer, cellular telephone or any other personal device
18 that queries the division of vehicle's driver's license and identification card
19 records, displays or transmits digital proofs of drivers' licenses and digital
20 proof of identification cards and verifies the authenticity of those
21 electronic credentials.
22 (d) "Limited profile" means access to an electronic credentialing
23 system containing some, but not all, of the information displayed on a

31 and uniform system for issuing an optional digital proof of driver's license
32 or digital proof of identification card. The division may contract with one
33 or more entities that may be private or public to develop an electronic
34 credentialing system. An entity contracted with the division for this
35 purpose shall not use, share, sell or disclose any information obtained as
36 part of this contract, including, but not limited to, any information about

SB 230 2
1 the holder of a digital proof of driver's license and digital proof of
2 identification card, except when necessary to satisfy the terms of the
3 contract. Upon termination or expiration of any contract entered into for
4 this purpose, the contracting entity shall delete within 30 days any data
5 collected or generated in the course of activities pursuant to that contract.
6 (2) The electronic credentialing system may not retain internet
7 protocol addresses, geolocation data or other information that describes the
8 location, computer, computer system or computer network from which a

16 proofs of drivers' licenses or digital proof of identification cards, confirms
17 identity or verifies the authenticity of such electronic credentials.
18 (c) The division may use a telephone number submitted by a licensee
19 or cardholder in connection with a digital proof of driver's license and
20 digital proof of identification card only for purposes of communication
21 regarding the digital proof of driver's license or digital proof of

4 only information necessary to conduct a specific transaction on the
5 electronic credentialing system.
6 (d) The division shall ensure that the information transmitted to the
7 digital proof of driver's license and digital proof of identification card, as
8 well as any mobile application required for the digital proof of driver's
9 license and digital proof of identification card, is encrypted and protected
10 to the highest reasonable security standards broadly available, including
11 ISO-18013-5, FIPS 140.3, NIST 800-53 Moderate, and cannot be
12 intercepted while being transmitted from the division.
13 New Sec. 4. An individual may not be issued a digital proof of
14 driver's license or digital proof of identification card until the individual
15 satisfies all requirements of articles 2 and 13 of chapter 8 of the Kansas

30 consent of the holder of the digital proof of driver's license or digital proof
31 of identification card.
32 (b) An individual may consent to allow a person to collect and store
33 information obtained by scanning the individual's digital proof of driver's

35 give consent, the individual shall be informed regarding what information
36 is to be collected and the purpose or purposes for which the information
37 will be used. If the individual does not want the person to scan such
38 individual's digital proof of driver's license or digital proof of
39 identification card, the person may manually collect information from the

26 the digital proof of driver's license and digital proof of identification card
27 for identity verification. The holder of a digital proof of driver's license
28 and digital proof of identification card showing or turning over their
29 electronic device to any other person or entity in order to provide proof of
30 digital proof of driver's license and digital proof of identification card for
31 identity verification shall not constitute consent to a search, nor shall it
32 constitute consent for access to any information other than that which is
33 immediately available on the digital proof of driver's license and digital
34 proof of identification card. Information incidentally obtained in the
35 process of viewing a digital proof of driver's license and digital proof of

15 (d) A digital proof of driver's license or digital proof of identification
16 card shall not be a valid form of identification to satisfy the requirements
17 of K.S.A. 8-244, and amendments thereto, K.S.A. 25-2908, and

25 extend to the division's issuance and administration of digital proof of
26 driver's license, digital proof of identification card and electronic
27 credentialing system.
28 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 8-235 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-235. (a)
29 No person, except those expressly exempted, shall drive any motor vehicle
30 upon a highway in this state unless such person has a valid driver's license.
31 No person shall receive a driver's license unless and until such person
32 surrenders or with the approval of the division, lists to the division all
33 valid licenses in such person's possession issued to such person by any
34 other jurisdiction. All surrendered licenses, digital proof of drivers'
35 licenses or the information listed on foreign licenses shall be returned by
36 the division to the issuing department, together with information that the
37 licensee is now licensed in a new jurisdiction. No person shall be
38 permitted to have more than one valid license at any time.
39 (b) Any person licensed under the motor vehicle drivers' license act
40 may exercise the privilege granted upon all streets and highways in this
41 state and shall not be required to obtain any other license to exercise such
42 privilege by any local authority. Nothing herein shall prevent cities from
43 requiring licenses of persons who drive taxicabs or municipally franchised

SB 230 6
1 transit systems for hire upon city streets, to protect the public from drivers
2 whose character or habits make them unfit to transport the public. If a
3 license is denied, the applicant may appeal such decision to the district
4 court of the county in which such city is located by filing within 14 days
5 after such denial, a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court and
6 by filing a copy of such notice with the city clerk of the involved city. The
7 city clerk shall certify a copy of such decision of the city governing body
8 to the clerk of the district court and the matter shall be docketed as any
9 other cause and the applicant shall be granted a trial of such person's
10 character and habits. The matter shall be heard by the court de novo in
11 accordance with the code of civil procedure. The cost of such appeal shall
12 be assessed in such manner as the court may direct.
13 (c) Any person operating in this state a motor vehicle shall be the
14 holder of a driver's license that is classified for the operation of such motor
15 vehicle, and any person operating in this state a motorcycle that is
16 registered in this state shall be the holder of a class M driver's license.
17 (d) No person shall drive any motorized bicycle upon a highway of
18 this state unless such person:
19 (1) Has a valid driver's license that entitles the licensee to drive a
20 motor vehicle in any class or classes;
21 (2) is at least 15 years of age and has passed the written and visual
22 examinations required for obtaining a class C driver's license, in which
23 case the division shall issue to such person a class C license, which shall
24 clearly indicate that such license is valid only for the operation of
25 motorized bicycles; or
26 (3) has had their driving privileges revoked under K.S.A. 8-286, and
27 amendments thereto, has not had a test refusal or test failure or alcohol or
28 drug-related conviction, as those terms are defined in K.S.A. 8-1013, and
29 amendments thereto, in the last five years, has not been convicted of a
30 violation of K.S.A. 8-1568(b), and amendments thereto, in the last five
31 years and has made application to the division for issuance of a class C
32 license for the operation of motorized bicycles, in accordance with
33 paragraph (2), in which case the division shall issue such person a class C
34 license, which shall clearly indicate that such license is valid only for the
35 operation of motorized bicycles. As used in this subsection, "motorized
36 bicycle" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in K.S.A. 8-126, and
37 amendments thereto.
38 (e) Violation of this section is a class B nonperson misdemeanor.
39 Sec. 10. K.S.A. 8-240 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-240.
40 (a) (1) Every application for an instruction permit shall be made upon a
41 form furnished by the division of vehicles and accompanied by a fee of $2
42 for class A, B, C or M and $5 for all commercial classes. Every other
43 application shall be made upon a form furnished by the division and

SB 230 7
1 accompanied by an examination fee of $3, unless a different fee is required
2 by K.S.A. 8-241, and amendments thereto, and by the proper fee for the
3 license for which the application is made. All commercial class applicants
4 shall be charged a $15 driving test fee for the drive test portion of the
5 commercial driver's license application. If the applicant is not required to
6 take an examination or the commercial license drive test, the examination
7 or commercial drive test fee shall not be required. The examination shall
8 consist of three tests, as follows: (A) Vision; (B) written; and (C) driving.
9 For a commercial driver's license, the drive test shall consist of three
10 components, as follows: (A) Pre-trip; (B) skills test; and (C) road test. If
11 the applicant fails the vision test, the applicant may have correction of
12 vision made and take the vision test again without any additional fee. If an
13 applicant fails the written test, the applicant may take such test again upon
14 the payment of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant fails
15 the driving test, the applicant may take such test again upon the payment
16 of an additional examination fee of $1.50. If an applicant for a commercial
17 driver's license fails any portion of the commercial drive test, the applicant
18 may take such test again upon the payment of an additional drive test fee
19 of $10. If an applicant fails to pass all three of the tests within a period of
20 six months from the date of original application and desires to take
21 additional tests, the applicant shall file an application for reexamination
22 upon a form furnished by the division, which shall be accompanied by a
23 reexamination fee of $3, except that any applicant who fails to pass the
24 written or driving portion of an examination four times within a six-month
25 period, shall be required to wait a period of six months from the date of the
26 last failed examination before additional examinations may be given.
27 Upon the filing of such application and the payment of such reexamination
28 fee, the applicant shall be entitled to reexamination in like manner and
29 subject to the additional fees and time limitation as provided for
30 examination on an original application. If the applicant passes the
31 reexamination, the applicant shall be issued the classified driver's license
32 for which the applicant originally applied, which license shall be issued to
33 expire as if the applicant had passed the original examination.
34 (2) Applicants for class M licenses who have completed prior
35 motorcycle safety training in accordance with department of defense
36 instruction 6055.04 (DoDI 6055.04) or the motorcycle safety foundation
37 are not required to complete further written and driving testing pursuant to
38 paragraph (1). An applicant seeking exemption from the written and
39 driving tests pursuant to this paragraph shall provide a copy of the
40 motorcycle safety foundation completion form to the division prior to
41 receiving a class M license.
42 (3) On and after January 1, 2017, An applicant for a class M license
43 who passes a driving examination on a three-wheeled motorcycle that is

SB 230 8
1 not an autocycle shall have a restriction placed on such applicant's license
2 limiting the applicant to the operation of a registered three-wheeled
3 motorcycle. An applicant for a class M license who passes a driving
4 examination on a two-wheeled motorcycle may operate any registered
5 two-wheeled or three-wheeled motorcycle. The driving examination
6 required by this paragraph shall be administered by the division, by the
7 department of defense or as part of a curriculum recognized by the
8 motorcycle safety foundation.
9 (b) (1) For the purposes of obtaining any driver's license or
10 instruction permit, an applicant shall submit, with the application, proof of
11 age and proof of identity as the division may require. The applicant also
12 shall provide a photo identity document, except that a non-photo identity
13 document is acceptable if it includes both the applicant's full legal name
14 and date of birth, and documentation showing the applicant's name, the
15 applicant's address of principal residence and the applicant's social security
16 number. The applicant's social security number shall remain confidential
17 and shall not be disclosed, except as provided pursuant to K.S.A. 74-2012,
18 and amendments thereto. If the applicant does not have a social security

12 through an electronic online application in the immediately preceding
13 card's expiration period. No renewal under this subsection shall be granted
14 to any person who is a registered offender pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4901 et
15 seq., and amendments thereto.
16 (q) (1) An identification card issued pursuant to this section may
17 include an optional digital proof of identification card. A digital proof of
18 identification card may be issued upon request by an applicant and
19 payment of the required fee. A digital proof of identification card is
20 optional to purchase and supplemental to a physical identification card.
21 Except as provided in section 7, and amendments thereto, a digital proof
22 of identification card shall be accepted in lieu of a physical identification
23 card to a person requesting or requiring proof of identification. No digital
24 proof of identification card shall be issued unless the applicant holds the
25 corresponding physical identification card or the corresponding physical
26 identification card is issued simultaneously. The division may digitally
27 cancel, suspend or revalidate a digital proof of identification card on the
28 occasions that a physical identification card would be canceled,
29 suspended, returned or reinstated, as appropriate. A digital proof of
30 identification card shall meet the requirements and conditions provided in
31 sections 2 through 8, and amendments thereto, before being issued by the
32 division pursuant to this subsection.
33 (2) As used in this subsection, "digital proof of identification card"
34 means the same as defined in section 1, and amendments thereto.
35 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 8-1325 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-1325.
36 (a) Every identification card shall expire, unless earlier canceled or
37 subsection (c) of K.S.A. 8-1324, and amendments thereto, applies, on the
38 sixth birthday of the applicant following the date of original issue, except
39 as otherwise provided by K.S.A. 8-1329, and amendments thereto.
40 Renewal of any identification card shall be made for a term of six years
41 and shall expire in a like manner as the originally issued identification
42 card, unless surrendered earlier or subsection (c) of K.S.A. 8-1324, and
43 amendments thereto, applies. For any person who has been issued an

SB 230 19
1 identification card, the division shall mail a notice of expiration or renewal
2 at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such person's identification card
3 at the address shown on such identification card. The division shall include
4 with such notice, written information required under subsection (b). Any
5 application for renewal received later than 90 days after expiration of the
6 identification card shall be considered to be an application for an original
7 identification card. The division shall require payment of a fee of $14 for
8 each identification card renewal, except that persons who are 65 or more
9 years of age or who are persons with a disability, as defined in K.S.A. 8-
10 1,124, and amendments thereto, shall be required to pay a fee of $10. Any
11 identification card holder, whose identification card has expired after
12 March 12, 2020, and before March 31, 2021, shall have until June 30,
13 2021, to renew such identification card.
14 (b) The division shall reference the website of the agency in a
15 person's notice of expiration or renewal under subsection (a). The division
16 shall provide the following information on the website of the agency:
17 (1) Information explaining the person's right to make an anatomical
18 gift in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1328, and amendments thereto, and the
19 revised uniform anatomical gift act, K.S.A. 65-3220 through 65-3244, and
20 amendments thereto;
21 (2) information describing the organ donation registry program
22 maintained by the Kansas federally designated organ procurement
23 organization. The information required under this paragraph shall include,
24 in a type, size and format that is conspicuous in relation to the surrounding
25 material, the address and telephone number of Kansas' federally
26 designated organ procurement organization, along with an advisory to call
27 such designated organ procurement organization with questions about the
28 organ donor registry program;
29 (3) information giving the applicant the opportunity to be placed on
30 the organ donation registry described in paragraph (2);
31 (4) inform the applicant that, if the applicant indicates under this
32 subsection a willingness to have such applicant's name placed on the organ
33 donor registry described in paragraph (2), the division will forward the
34 applicant's name, gender, date of birth and most recent address to the organ
35 donation registry maintained by the Kansas federally designated organ
36 procurement organization, as required by paragraph (6);
37 (5) the division may fulfill the requirements of paragraph (4) by one
38 or more of the following methods:
39 (A) Providing such information on the website of the agency; or
40 (B) providing printed material to an applicant who personally applies
41 for an identification card; and
42 (6) if an applicant indicates a willingness under this subsection to
43 have such applicant's name placed on the organ donor registry described,

SB 230 20
1 the division shall within 10 days forward the applicant's name, gender,
2 date of birth and address to the organ donor registry maintained by the
3 Kansas federally designated organ procurement organization. The division
4 may forward information under this subsection by mail or by electronic
5 means. The division shall not maintain a record of the name or address of
6 an individual who indicates a willingness to have such person's name
7 placed on the organ donor registry after forwarding that information to the
8 organ donor registry under this subsection. Information about an
9 applicant's indication of a willingness to have such applicant's name placed
10 on the organ donor registry that is obtained by the division and forwarded
11 under this paragraph shall be confidential and not disclosed.
12 (c) A fee of $10 shall be charged for the issuance of a digital proof of
13 identification card.
14 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 8-1328 is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-1328.
15 (a) The identification card shall resemble in appearance, so far as is
16 practicable, a driver's license issued in accordance with K.S.A. 8-243, and
17 amendments thereto, and shall adequately describe the registrant. The
18 identification card shall be sealed in transparent plastic or similar
19 substance, except that this requirement shall not apply to digital proof of
20 identification cards, as defined in section 1, and amendments thereto.
21 (b) All Kansas identification cards issued to any person 16 years of
22 age or older shall contain a form which that provides a statement for
23 making a gift of all or any part of the body in accordance with the revised
24 uniform anatomical gift act, K.S.A. 65-3220 through 65-3244, and
25 amendments thereto, except as otherwise provided by this subsection. The
26 statement to be effective shall be signed by the applicant in the presence of
27 two witnesses who shall sign the statement in the presence of the donor.
28 The gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. Delivery of the
29 identification card during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make a
30 valid gift. Any valid gift statement executed prior to July 1, 2007, shall
31 remain effective until invalidated. The word "Donor" shall be placed on
32 the front of an applicant's identification card, indicating that the statement
33 for making an anatomical gift under this subsection has been executed by
34 such applicant.
35 Sec. 15. K.S.A. 8-235, 8-240, 8-1325 and 8-1328 and K.S.A. 2024
36 Supp. 8-243 and 8-1324 are hereby repealed.
37 Sec. 16. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
38 publication in the statute book.
