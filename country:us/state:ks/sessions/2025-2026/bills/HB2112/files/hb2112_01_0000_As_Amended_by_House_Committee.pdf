15 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 65-163 is hereby amended to read as
16 follows: 65-163. (a) (1) No person shall operate a public water supply
17 system within the state without a public water supply system permit
18 from the secretary. An application for a public water supply system
19 permit shall be submitted for review and approval prior to
20 construction and shall include:
21 (A) A copy of the plans and specifications for the construction of
22 the public water supply system or the extension thereof;
23 (B) a description of the source from which the water supply is to
24 be derived;
25 (C) the proposed manner of storage, purification or treatment for
26 the supply; and
27 (D) such other data and information as required by the secretary
28 of health and environment. No source of water supply in substitution
29 for or in addition to the source described in the application or in any
30 subsequent application for which a public water supply system permit
31 is issued shall be used by a public water supply system, nor shall any
32 change be made in the manner of storage, purification or treatment of
33 the water supply without an additional public water supply system
34 permit obtained in a manner similar to that prescribed by this section
35 from the secretary.

HB 2112—Am. by HC 2
1 (2) Whenever application is made to the secretary for a public
2 water supply system permit under the provisions of this section, it
3 shall be the duty of the secretary to examine the application without
4 delay and, as soon as possible thereafter, to grant or deny the public
5 water supply system permit subject to any conditions that may be
6 imposed by the secretary to protect the public health and welfare.
7 (3) The secretary may adopt rules and regulations establishing a
8 program of annual certification by public water supply systems that
9 have staff qualified to approve the extension of distribution systems or
10 the replacement of segments of distribution systems without the
11 necessity of securing an additional permit for the extension or
12 replacement provided the plans for the extension or replacement are
13 prepared by a professional engineer as defined by K.S.A. 74-7003, and
14 amendments thereto.
15 (b) (1) Whenever a complaint is made to the secretary by any city
16 of the state, by a local health officer, or by a county or joint board of
17 health concerning the sanitary quality of any water supplied to the
18 public within the county in which the city, local health officer or
19 county or joint board of health is located, the secretary shall
20 investigate the public water supply system about which the complaint
21 is made. Whenever the secretary has reason to believe that a public
22 water supply system within the state is being operated in violation of
23 an applicable state law or an applicable rule and regulation of the
24 secretary, the secretary may investigate the public water supply
25 system.
26 (2) Whenever an investigation of any public water supply system
27 is undertaken by the secretary, it shall be the duty of the supplier of
28 water under investigation to furnish to the secretary information to
29 determine the sanitary quality of the water supplied to the public and
30 to determine compliance with applicable state laws and rules and
31 regulations. The secretary may issue an order requiring changes in the
32 source or sources of the public water supply system or in the manner
33 of storage, purification or treatment utilized by the public water
34 supply system before delivery to consumers, or distribution facilities,
35 collectively or individually, as may in the secretary's judgment be
36 necessary to safeguard the sanitary quality of the water and bring
37 about compliance with applicable state law and rules and regulations.
38 The supplier of water shall comply with the order of the secretary.
39 (c) (1) As used in this subsection, "municipal water treatment
40 residues" means any solid, semisolid or liquid residue generated
41 during the treatment of water in a public water supply system
42 treatment works.
43 (2) A public water supply system may place or store municipal

HB 2112—Am. by HC 3
1 water treatment residues resulting from sedimentation, coagulation or
2 softening treatment processes in basins on land under the ownership
3 and control of the public water supply system operator provided that
4 such storage or placement is approved and permitted by the secretary
5 under this section as part of the public water supply system.
6 (3) The secretary shall adopt uniform and comprehensive rules
7 and regulations for the location, design and operation of such basins.
8 Such rules and regulations shall require permit applications by the
9 public water suppliers for such basins to include a copy of the plans
10 and specifications for the location and construction of each basin, the
11 means of conveyance of the treatment residues to such basins, the
12 content of treatment residues, the proposed method of basin operation
13 and closure, the method of any anticipated expansion and any other
14 data and information required by the secretary.
15 (4) Whenever complaint is made to the secretary by the mayor of
16 any city of the state, by a local health officer or by a county or joint
17 board of health, or whenever an investigation is undertaken at the
18 initiative of the secretary, relating to any alleged violation of the
19 provisions of the permit for placement or storage of municipal water
20 treatment residues in such basins, the public water supply system
21 operator shall furnish all information the secretary requires. If the
22 secretary finds that there is any violation of the terms of the permit,
23 that the means of placement and storage exceed the terms of the
24 permit or that any other condition exists by reason of the means of
25 placement and storage that may be detrimental to the health of any
26 inhabitants of the state or to the environment, the secretary shall have
27 the authority to issue an order amending the permit or otherwise
28 requiring the operator to perform remedial measures to curtail or
29 prevent such detrimental conditions.
30 (d) Orders of the secretary under this section, and hearings
31 thereon, shall be subject to the provisions of the Kansas
32 administrative procedure act. Any action of the secretary pursuant to
33 this section is subject to review in accordance with the Kansas judicial
34 review act. The court on review shall hear the case without delay.
35 (e) The secretary shall establish by rule and regulation a system
36 of fees for the inspection and regulation of public water supplies. No
37 such fee shall exceed $.002 per 1,000 gallons of water sold at retail by a
38 public water supply system. All such fees shall be paid quarterly in the
39 manner provided for fees imposed on retail sales by public water
40 supply systems pursuant to K.S.A. 82a-954, and amendments thereto.
41 The secretary shall remit all moneys collected for such fees to the state
42 treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and
43 amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state

HB 2112—Am. by HC 4
1 treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the
2 credit of the public water supply fee fund created by K.S.A. 65-163c,
3 and amendments thereto.

8 water supply systems;

14 public water supply fee fund created by K.S.A. 65-163c, and

18 department of health and environment,;

20 to represent such office; and two
21 (3) four members appointed by the secretary as follows:

32 shall meet at least four times each year and on call of the secretary or a
33 majority of the members of the committee.
34 (i) On or before February 1 of each year, the secretary shall provide
35 a written report to the legislature that includes the number of operator
36 examinations administered during the previous two calendar years and the
37 pass rates of such examinations, including the pass rates of each separate
38 classification of operator.
39 Section 1. Sec. 2. K.S.A. 65-4513 is hereby amended to read as
