16 participant account recordkeeping services and other services related to the
17 administration of the Kansas retirement investment and savings plan.
18 (c) No significant costs shall be incurred by the state as a result of the

20 means: (1) A service charge collected from all participants; or (2) credit
21 allowances or reimbursement of specified plan expenses as provided under
22 agreements with one or more qualified private firms entered into pursuant
23 to subsection (b). The amount of any such significant costs incurred and to

25 New Sec. 5. (a) (1) An employee who is first employed by a
26 participating employer on or after July 1, 2027, may elect to become a

38 make a lump-sum payment for up to the balance of the service credit
39 remaining to be purchased prior to transferring, subject to the limitations

41 payment, unless made by a rollover, shall be made with after-tax dollars.
42 (f) (1) Employee and employer contributions shall be made to the

18 annuity account.

9 division of the budget in the case of the state and to the agent for each
10 other participating employer an actuarially determined estimate of the rate
11 of contribution that will be required, together with all accumulated
12 contributions and other assets of the system, to be paid by each such
13 participating employer to pay all liabilities that shall exist or accrue under
14 the system, including amortization of the actuarial accrued liability as
15 determined by the board. The board shall determine the actuarial cost
16 method to be used in annual actuarial valuations, to determine the

18 certified rate of contribution, amortization methods and periods and
19 actuarial cost method shall be based on the standards set forth in K.S.A.
20 74-4908(3)(a), and amendments thereto, and shall not be based on any
21 other purpose outside of the needs of the system.
22 (b) (i) For employers affiliating on and after January 1, 1999, upon
23 the basis of an annual actuarial valuation and appraisal of the system
24 conducted in the manner provided for in K.S.A. 74-4908, and amendments
25 thereto, the board shall certify, on or before July 15 of each year to each
26 such employer an actuarially determined estimate of the rate of
27 contribution that shall be required to be paid by each such employer to pay
28 all of the liabilities that shall accrue under the system from and after the
29 entry date as determined by the board, upon recommendation of the
30 actuary. Such rate shall be termed the employer's participating service
31 contribution and shall be uniform for all participating employers. Such
32 additional liability shall be amortized as determined by the board. For all
33 participating employers described in this section, the board shall determine
34 the actuarial cost method to be used in annual actuarial valuations to
35 determine the employer contribution rates that shall be certified by the
36 board.
37 (ii) The board shall determine for each such employer separately an
38 amount sufficient to amortize all liabilities for prior service costs that shall
39 have accrued at the time of entry into the system. On the basis of such
40 determination the board shall annually certify to each such employer
41 separately an actuarially determined estimate of the rate of contribution
42 that shall be required to be paid by that employer to pay all of the
43 liabilities for such prior service costs. Such rate shall be termed the
SB 282 13
1 employer's prior service contribution.
2 (c) On and after July 1, 2027, the board shall certify a contribution
3 rate required to amortize the unfunded actuarial liability of the defined
4 benefit plan. Such certified rate of contribution, amortization methods,
5 periods and actuarial cost method shall be based on the standards set
6 forth in K.S.A. 74-4908(3)(a), and amendments thereto, and shall not be
7 based on any other purpose outside of the needs of the system. Each
8 participating employer shall appropriate and pay such certified
9 contribution rate as applied to the total compensation of employees
10 participating in the Kansas retirement investment and savings plan act
11 and the defined benefit plan.
12 (2) The division of the budget and the governor shall include in the
13 budget and in the budget request for appropriations for personal services
14 the sum required to satisfy the state's obligation under this act as certified
15 by the board and shall present the same to the legislature for allowance and
16 appropriation.
17 (3) Each other participating employer shall appropriate and pay to the
18 system a sum sufficient to satisfy the obligation under this act as certified
19 by the board.
20 (4) Each participating employer is hereby authorized to pay the
21 employer's contribution from the same fund that the compensation for
22 which such contribution is made is paid from or from any other funds
23 available to it for such purpose. Each political subdivision, other than an
24 instrumentality of the state, that is by law authorized to levy taxes for other
25 purposes, may levy annually at the time of its levy of taxes, a tax that may
26 be in addition to all other taxes authorized by law for the purpose of
27 making its contributions under this act and, in the case of cities and
28 counties, to pay a portion of the principal and interest on bonds issued
29 under the authority of K.S.A. 12-1774, and amendments thereto, by cities
30 located in the county, which tax, together with any other fund available,
31 shall be sufficient to enable it to make such contribution. In lieu of levying
32 the tax authorized in this subsection, any taxing subdivision may pay such
33 costs from any employee benefits contribution fund established pursuant to
34 K.S.A. 12-16,102, and amendments thereto. Each participating employer
35 that is not by law authorized to levy taxes as described above, but that
36 prepares a budget for its expenses for the ensuing year and presents the
37 same to a governing body that is authorized by law to levy taxes as
38 described above, may include in its budget an amount sufficient to make
39 its contributions under this act, which may be in addition to all other taxes
40 authorized by law. Such governing body to which the budget is submitted
41 for approval, may levy a tax sufficient to allow the participating employer
42 to make its contributions under this act, which tax, together with any other
43 fund available, shall be sufficient to enable the participating employer to
SB 282 14
1 make the contributions required by this act.

39 commencing in calendar year 1997 and in each subsequent calendar year,
40 the rate of contribution certified to participating employers other than the
41 state of Kansas shall in no event exceed such participating employer's

20 July 1, 2027, for the purposes of this section, member compensation shall
21 include compensation of members of the Kansas retirement investment and
22 savings plan established under sections 1 through 15, and amendments
23 thereto.

35 (vii) If the combined employer rate of contribution calculated for the

6 forth in K.S.A. 74-4908(3)(a), and amendments thereto, and shall not be
7 based on any other purpose outside of the needs of the system. Each
8 participating employer shall appropriate and pay such certified
9 contribution rate as applied to the total compensation of employees
10 participating in the Kansas retirement investment and savings plan act
11 and the defined benefit plan.
12 (2) The division of the budget and the governor shall include in the
13 budget and in the budget request for appropriations for personal services
14 the sum required to satisfy the state's obligation under this act as certified
15 by the board and shall present the same to the legislature for allowance and
16 appropriation.
17 (3) Each other participating employer shall appropriate and pay to the
18 system a sum sufficient to satisfy the obligation under this act as certified
19 by the board.
20 (4) Each participating employer is hereby authorized to pay the
21 employer's contribution from the same fund that the compensation for
22 which such contribution is made is paid from or from any other funds
23 available to it for such purpose. Each political subdivision, other than an
24 instrumentality of the state, that is by law authorized to levy taxes for other
25 purposes, may levy annually at the time of its levy of taxes, a tax that may
26 be in addition to all other taxes authorized by law for the purpose of
27 making its contributions under this act and, in the case of cities and
28 counties, to pay a portion of the principal and interest on bonds issued
29 under the authority of K.S.A. 12-1774, and amendments thereto, by cities
30 located in the county, which tax, together with any other fund available,
31 shall be sufficient to enable it to make such contribution. In lieu of levying
32 the tax authorized in this subsection, any taxing subdivision may pay such
33 costs from any employee benefits contribution fund established pursuant to
34 K.S.A. 12-16,102, and amendments thereto. Each participating employer
35 that is not by law authorized to levy taxes as described above, but that
36 prepares a budget for its expenses for the ensuing year and presents the
37 same to a governing body that is authorized by law to levy taxes as
38 described above, may include in its budget an amount sufficient to make
39 its contributions under this act, which may be in addition to all other taxes
40 authorized by law. Such governing body to which the budget is submitted
41 for approval, may levy a tax sufficient to allow the participating employer
42 to make its contributions under this act, which tax, together with any other
43 fund available, shall be sufficient to enable the participating employer to

SB 282 14
1 make the contributions required by this act.

11 members contribute during the period.
12 (ii) Except as specifically provided in this subsection, for the fiscal
13 years commencing in the following calendar years, the rate of contribution

31 fiscal year commencing in calendar year 2017, the employer rate of

37 preceding fiscal year.
38 (iii) Except as specifically provided in this section, for fiscal years
39 commencing in calendar year 1997 and in each subsequent calendar year,
40 the rate of contribution certified to participating employers other than the
41 state of Kansas shall in no event exceed such participating employer's
42 contribution rate for the immediately preceding fiscal year by more than
43 0.15% of the amount of compensation upon which members contribute

SB 282 15
1 during the period.
2 (iv) Except as specifically provided in this subsection, for the fiscal
3 years commencing in the following calendar years, the rate of contribution
4 certified to participating employers other than the state of Kansas shall in
5 no event exceed the contribution rate for such employers for the
6 immediately preceding fiscal year by more than the following amounts
7 expressed as a percentage of compensation upon which members

12 more than 0.9% of the amount of the immediately preceding fiscal year;
13 (C) for the fiscal year commencing in calendar year 2015, an amount not
14 to exceed more than 1% of the amount of the immediately preceding fiscal
15 year; (D) for the fiscal year commencing in calendar year 2016, an amount
16 not to exceed more than 1.1% of the amount of the immediately preceding

20 July 1, 2027, for the purposes of this section, member compensation shall
21 include compensation of members of the Kansas retirement investment and
22 savings plan established under sections 1 through 15, and amendments
23 thereto.
24 (v) As part of the annual actuarial valuation, there shall be a separate
25 employer rate of contribution calculated for the state of Kansas, a separate
26 employer rate of contribution calculated for participating employers under
27 K.S.A. 74-4931, and amendments thereto, a combined employer rate of

35 (vii) If the combined employer rate of contribution calculated for the
36 state of Kansas and participating employers under K.S.A. 74-4931, and
37 amendments thereto, is greater than the separate employer rate of
38 contribution for the state of Kansas, the difference in the two rates applied
39 to the actual payroll of the state of Kansas for the applicable fiscal year

41 as additional employer contributions to the retirement benefit
42 accumulation reserve for the participating employers under K.S.A. 74-
43 4931, and amendments thereto.

SB 282 16
