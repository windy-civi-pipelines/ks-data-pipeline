35 but has made efforts towards full compliance.
36 (b) (1) In all cases where the secretary for children and families
37 deems it necessary, an investigation of the maternity center or child care
38 facility shall be made under the supervision of the secretary for children

14 investigation or is advised by the secretary for children and families that
15 any of the provisions of this act or the provisions of K.S.A. 59-2123, and
16 amendments thereto, are being violated, or that the maternity center or

19 may issue an order revoking such license after giving notice and
20 conducting a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas

22 the revocation.
23 (e) If the secretary revokes or refuses to renew a license, the licensee
24 who had a license revoked or not renewed shall not be eligible to apply for

26 refusal to renew becomes final. If the secretary revokes or refuses to renew
27 a license of a licensee who is a repeat, three or more times, violator of
28 statutory requirements or rules and regulations or is found to have
29 contributed to the death or serious bodily harm of a child under such
30 licensee's care, such licensee shall be permanently prohibited from
31 applying for a new license to provide child care or from seeking
32 employment under another licensee.
33 (f) Any applicant or licensee aggrieved by a final order of the
34 secretary of health and environment denying or revoking a license under
35 this act may appeal the order in accordance with the Kansas judicial
