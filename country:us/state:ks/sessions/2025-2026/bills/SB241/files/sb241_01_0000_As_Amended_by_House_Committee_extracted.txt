By Committee on Judiciary
2-6
1 AN ACT concerning restraint of trade; relating to restrictive covenants;
2 providing that certain restrictive covenants are not considered a
3 restraint of trade and shall be enforceable; amending K.S.A. 2024
4 Supp. 50-163 and repealing the existing section.

6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 50-163 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 50-163. (a) The purpose of this section, and the amendments to
9 K.S.A. 50-101, 50-112, 50-158 and 50-161 by this act chapter 102 of the
10 2013 Session Laws of Kansas, is to clarify and reduce any uncertainty or
11 ambiguity as to the application of the Kansas restraint of trade act and
12 applicable evidentiary standards to certain types of business contracts,
13 agreements and arrangements that are not intended to unreasonably
14 restrain trade or commerce and do not contravene public welfare.
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e), the
16 Kansas restraint of trade act shall be construed in harmony with ruling
17 judicial interpretations of federal antitrust law by the United States
18 supreme court. If such judicial interpretations are in conflict with or
19 inconsistent with the express provisions of subsection (c), the provisions of
20 subsection (c) shall control. If a covenant that is not presumed to be
21 enforceable pursuant to subsection (c) is determined to be overbroad or
22 otherwise not reasonably necessary to protect a business interest of the
23 business entity seeking enforcement of the covenant, the court shall modify
24 the covenant, enforce the covenant as modified and grant only the relief
25 reasonably necessary to protect such interests.
26 (c) (1) An arrangement, contract, agreement, trust, understanding or
27 combination shall not be deemed a trust pursuant to the Kansas restraint of
28 trade act and shall not be deemed unlawful, void, prohibited or wrongful
29 under any provision of the Kansas restraint of trade act if that arrangement,
30 contract, agreement, trust, understanding or combination is a reasonable
31 restraint of trade or commerce. An arrangement, contract, agreement, trust,
32 understanding or combination is a reasonable restraint of trade or
33 commerce if such restraint is reasonable in view of all of the facts and
34 circumstances of the particular case and does not contravene public
35 welfare.

SB 241—Am. by HC 2
1 recruit, induce, persuade, encourage, direct or otherwise interfere with,
2 directly or indirectly, one or more employees or owners of a business
3 entity for the purpose of interfering with the employment or ownership
4 relationship of such employees or owners shall be conclusively
5 presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade if the covenant is
6 between a business entity and an owner of the business entity and the

10 induce, persuade, encourage, service, direct or otherwise interfere with,
11 directly or indirectly, a business entity's customers, including any
12 reduction, termination, acceptance or transfer of any customer's business,
13 in whole or in part, for the purpose of providing any product or service
14 that is competitive with those provided by the business entity shall be
15 conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade if the
16 covenant is limited to material contact customers and the covenant does
17 not continue for more than four years following the end of the owner's
18 business relationship with the business entity.
19 (4) A covenant in writing in which an employee of a business entity
20 agrees to not solicit, recruit, induce, persuade, encourage, direct or
21 otherwise interfere with, directly or indirectly, one or more employees or
22 owners of a business entity for the purpose of interfering with the
23 employment or ownership relationship of such employees or owners
24 shall be conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of
25 trade if the covenant is between an employer and one or more employees
26 and the covenant:
27 (A) Seeks, on the part of the employer, to protect confidential or trade
28 secret business information or customer or supplier relationships,
29 goodwill or loyalty; or
30 (B) does not continue for more than two years following the
31 employee's employment.
32 (5) A covenant in writing in which an employee agrees not to solicit,
33 recruit, induce, persuade, encourage, direct or otherwise interfere with,
34 directly or indirectly, a business entity's customers, including any
35 reduction, termination, acceptance or transfer of any customer's business,
36 in whole or in part, for the purpose of providing any product or service
37 that is competitive with those provided by the employer shall be
38 conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade if the
39 covenant is limited to material contact customers and the covenant is
40 between an employer and an employee and does not continue for more
41 than two years following the end of the employee's employment with the
42 employer.
43 (6) A provision in writing in which an owner agrees to provide prior
SB 241—Am. by HC 3
1 notice of the owner's intent to terminate, sell or otherwise dispose of such
2 owner's ownership interest in the business entity shall be conclusively
3 presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade.
4 (7) Notwithstanding the presumption of enforceability provided
5 in subsections (c)(2) through (c)(5), an employee or owner shall be
6 permitted to assert any applicable defense available at law or in equity
7 for the court's consideration in a dispute regarding a written
8 covenant.
9 (d) The Kansas restraint of trade act shall not be construed to
10 prohibit:
11 (1) Actions or proceedings concerning intrastate commerce;
12 (2) actions or proceedings by indirect purchasers pursuant to K.S.A.
13 50-161, and amendments thereto;

25 of article 16 of chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
26 amendments thereto, the cooperative marketing act;

33 any limited liability company or corporation, or wholly owned subsidiary
34 thereof, providing electric service at wholesale in the state of Kansas that
35 is owned by four or more electric cooperatives that provide retail service

1 (6) any franchise agreements or covenants not to compete.
2 (f) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any
3 person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other
4 provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without
5 the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this
6 section are severable.
