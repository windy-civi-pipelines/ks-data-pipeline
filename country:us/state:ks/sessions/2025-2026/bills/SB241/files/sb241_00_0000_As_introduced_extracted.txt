2 providing that certain restrictive covenants are not considered a
3 restraint of trade and shall be enforceable; amending K.S.A. 2024
4 Supp. 50-163 and repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 50-163 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 50-163. (a) The purpose of this section, and the amendments to
9 K.S.A. 50-101, 50-112, 50-158 and 50-161 by this act chapter 102 of the
10 2013 Session Laws of Kansas, is to clarify and reduce any uncertainty or
11 ambiguity as to the application of the Kansas restraint of trade act and
12 applicable evidentiary standards to certain types of business contracts,
13 agreements and arrangements that are not intended to unreasonably
14 restrain trade or commerce and do not contravene public welfare.
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e), the
16 Kansas restraint of trade act shall be construed in harmony with ruling
17 judicial interpretations of federal antitrust law by the United States
18 supreme court. If such judicial interpretations are in conflict with or
19 inconsistent with the express provisions of subsection (c), the provisions of
20 subsection (c) shall control. If a covenant is determined to be overbroad or
21 otherwise not reasonably necessary to protect a business interest of the

23 the covenant, enforce the covenant as modified and grant only the relief
24 reasonably necessary to protect such interests.

26 combination shall not be deemed a trust pursuant to the Kansas restraint of
27 trade act and shall not be deemed unlawful, void, prohibited or wrongful
28 under any provision of the Kansas restraint of trade act if that arrangement,
29 contract, agreement, trust, understanding or combination is a reasonable
30 restraint of trade or commerce. An arrangement, contract, agreement, trust,
31 understanding or combination is a reasonable restraint of trade or
32 commerce if such restraint is reasonable in view of all of the facts and
33 circumstances of the particular case and does not contravene public
34 welfare.
35 (2) A covenant in writing in which an owner agrees to not solicit,
36 recruit, induce, persuade, encourage, direct or otherwise interfere with,
SB 241 2
1 directly or indirectly, one or more employees or owners of a business
2 entity shall be conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint
3 of trade if the covenant is between a business entity and an owner of the
4 business entity and the covenant does not continue for more than four
5 years following the end of the owner's business relationship with the
6 business entity.
7 (3) A covenant in writing in which an owner agrees to not solicit,
8 induce, persuade, encourage, service, direct or otherwise interfere with,

10 reduction, termination, acceptance or transfer of any customer's business,
11 in whole or in part, for the purpose of providing any product or service
12 that is competitive with those provided by the business entity shall be
13 conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade if the
14 covenant is limited to material contact customers and the covenant does
15 not continue for more than four years following the end of the owner's
16 business relationship with the business entity.
17 (4) A covenant in writing in which an employee agrees to not solicit,
18 recruit, induce, persuade, encourage, direct or otherwise interfere with,
19 directly or indirectly, one or more employees or owners of a business
20 entity shall be conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint
21 of trade if the covenant is between an employer and one or more
22 employees and the covenant:
23 (A) Seeks, on the part of the employer, to protect confidential or trade
24 secret business information or customer or supplier relationships,
25 goodwill or loyalty; or
26 (B) does not continue for more than two years following the
27 employee's employment.
28 (5) A covenant in writing in which an employee agrees not to solicit,
29 recruit, induce, persuade, encourage, direct or otherwise interfere with,
30 directly or indirectly, a business entity's customers, including any
31 reduction, termination, acceptance or transfer of any customer's business,
32 in whole or in part, for the purpose of providing any product or service
33 that is competitive with those provided by the employer shall be
34 conclusively presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade if the
35 covenant is limited to material contact customers and the covenant is
36 between an employer and an employee and does not continue for more
37 than two years following the end of the employee's employment with the
38 employer.
39 (6) A provision in writing in which an owner agrees to provide prior
40 notice of the owner's intent to terminate, sell or otherwise dispose of such

42 presumed to be enforceable and not a restraint of trade.
43 (d) The Kansas restraint of trade act shall not be construed to
SB 241 3
1 prohibit:
2 (1) Actions or proceedings concerning intrastate commerce;
3 (2) actions or proceedings by indirect purchasers pursuant to K.S.A.
4 50-161, and amendments thereto;

36 (f) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any
37 person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other
38 provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without
39 the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this
40 section are severable.
