12 returned on account of cancellations and dividends returned to enrollees. If
13 the commissioner shall determine at any time that the application of the
14 privilege fee, or a change in the rate of the privilege fee, would cause a
15 denial of, reduction in or elimination of federal financial assistance to the
16 state or to any health maintenance organization subject to this act, the
17 commissioner is hereby authorized to terminate the operation of such
18 privilege fee or the change in such privilege fee.
19 (c) For the purpose of insuring the collection of the privilege fee
20 provided for by subsection (b), every health maintenance organization

23 and amendments thereto, make a return, generated by or at the direction of
24 its chief officer or principal managing director, under penalty of K.S.A.
25 21-5824, and amendments thereto, to the commissioner, stating the amount
26 of all premiums, assessments and charges received by the health
27 maintenance organization, whether in cash or notes, during the year ending
28 on the last day of the preceding calendar year. Upon the receipt of such
29 returns the commissioner of insurance shall verify such returns and
30 reconcile the fees pursuant to subsection (f) upon such organization on the
31 basis and at the rate provided in this section.
32 (d) Premiums or other charges received by an insurance company
33 from the operation of a health maintenance organization subject to this act
34 shall not be subject to any fee or tax imposed under the provisions of
35 K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto.
36 (e) Fees charged under this section shall be remitted to the state
37 treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and
38 amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state
39 treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit
40 of the medical assistance fee fund created by K.S.A. 40-3236, and
41 amendments thereto.
42 (f) (1) On and after January 1, 2018, In addition to any other filing or

HB 2375 11
1 submit a report to the commissioner on or before March 31 and September
2 30 of each year containing an estimate of the total amount of all premiums,
3 subscription charges or any other term that may be used to describe the
4 charges made by such organization to enrollees that the organization
5 expects to collect during the current calendar year. Upon filing each March
6 31 report, the organization shall submit payment equal to ยฝ of the
7 privilege fee that would be assessed by the commissioner for the current
8 calendar year based upon the organization's reported estimate. Upon filing
9 each September 30 report, the organization shall submit payment equal to
10 the balance of the privilege fee that would be assessed by the
11 commissioner for the current calendar year based upon the organization's
12 reported estimates.
13 (2) Any amount of privilege fees actually owed by a health
14 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of estimated
15 privilege fees paid shall be assessed by the commissioner and shall be due
16 and payable upon issuance of such assessment.
17 (3) Any amount of estimated privilege fees paid by a health
18 maintenance organization during any calendar year in excess of privilege
19 fees actually owed shall be reconciled when the commissioner assesses
20 privilege fees in the ensuing calendar year. The commissioner shall credit
21 such excess amount against future privilege fee assessments. Any such
22 excess amount paid by a health maintenance organization that is no longer
23 doing business in Kansas and that no longer has a duty to pay the privilege
24 fee shall be refunded by the commissioner from funds appropriated by the
25 legislature for such purpose.
26 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 39-7,160 and 40-3213 are hereby repealed.
27 Sec. 15. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
28 publication in the Kansas register.
