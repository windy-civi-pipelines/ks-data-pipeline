27 determining eligibility for free or reduced meals, then such school shall be
28 deemed to have 0% of such school's students receiving free or reduced
29 meals.
30 (e) A private school's multiplier factor shall be determined by
31 calculating the sum of the multiplier factors determined under subsections
32 (b), (c) and (d).
