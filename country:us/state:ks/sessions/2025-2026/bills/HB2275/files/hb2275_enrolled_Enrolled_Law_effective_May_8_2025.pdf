Any county or city levying a retailers' sales tax is hereby prohibited

services of the state department of revenue to administer, enforce and
collect such tax. Except as otherwise specifically provided in K.S.A.

HOUSE BILL No. 2275—page 13
12-189a, and amendments thereto, such tax shall be identical in its
application, and exemptions therefrom, to the Kansas retailers' sales tax
act and all laws and administrative rules and regulations of the state
department of revenue relating to the Kansas retailers' sales tax shall
apply to such local sales tax insofar as such laws and rules and
regulations may be made applicable. The state director of taxation is
hereby authorized to administer, enforce and collect such local sales
taxes and to adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary for
the efficient and effective administration and enforcement thereof.
Upon receipt of a certified copy of an ordinance or resolution
authorizing the levy of a local retailers' sales tax, the director of
taxation shall cause such taxes to be collected within or without the
boundaries of such taxing subdivision at the same time and in the same
manner provided for the collection of the state retailers' sales tax. Such
copy shall be submitted to the director of taxation within 30 days after
adoption of any such ordinance or resolution. The director of taxation
shall confirm that all provisions of law applicable to the authorization
of local sales tax have been followed prior to causing the collection. If
the director of taxation discovers that a city or county did not comply
with any provision of law applicable to the authorization of a local
sales tax after collection has commenced, the director shall
immediately notify the city or county and cease collection of such sales
tax until such noncompliance is remedied. All moneys collected by the
director of taxation under the provisions of this section shall be credited
to a county and city retailers' sales tax fund which fund is hereby
established in the state treasury, except that all moneys collected by the
director of taxation pursuant to the authority granted in K.S.A. 12-
187(b)(22), and amendments thereto, shall be credited to the Wilson
county capital improvements fund. Any refund due on any county or
city retailers' sales tax collected pursuant to this act shall be paid out of
the sales tax refund fund and reimbursed by the director of taxation
from collections of local retailers' sales tax revenue. Except for local
retailers' sales tax revenue required to be deposited in the
redevelopment bond fund established under K.S.A. 74-8927, and
amendments thereto, all local retailers' sales tax revenue collected
within any county or city pursuant to this act shall be apportioned and
remitted at least quarterly by the state treasurer, on instruction from the
director of taxation, to the treasurer of such county or city.
Revenue that is received from the imposition of a local retailers'
sales tax that exceeds the amount of revenue required to pay the costs
of a special project for which such revenue was pledged shall be
credited to the city or county general fund, as the case requires.
The director of taxation shall provide, upon request by a city or
county clerk or treasurer or finance officer of any city or county
levying a local retailers' sales tax, monthly reports identifying each
retailer doing business in such city or county or making taxable sales
sourced to such city or county, setting forth the tax liability and the
amount of such tax remitted by each retailer during the preceding
month and identifying each business location maintained by the retailer
and such retailer's sales or use tax registration or account number. Such
report shall be made available to the clerk or treasurer or finance officer
of such city or county within a reasonable time after it has been
requested from the director of taxation. The director of taxation shall be
allowed to assess a reasonable fee for the issuance of such report.
Information received by any city or county pursuant to this section shall
be confidential, and it shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of
such city or county to divulge any such information in any manner. Any
violation of this paragraph by a city or county officer or employee is a
class A misdemeanor, and such officer or employee shall be dismissed
from office. Reports of violations of this paragraph shall be
investigated by the attorney general. The district attorney or county
attorney and the attorney general shall have authority to prosecute
violations of this paragraph.

countywide retailers' sales tax shall be apportioned among the county
and each city located in such county in the following manner:
(1) 1/ of all revenue received by the director of taxation shall be
2
apportioned among the county and each city located in such county in

unit bear to the total of all such levies made in the preceding year,
except that the apportionment pursuant to this provision shall not
change between July 1, 2025, and December 31, 2026; and
(2) 1/ of all revenue received by the director of taxation from such
2
countywide retailers' sales tax shall be apportioned among the county
and each city located in such county, first to the county that portion of
the revenue equal to the proportion that the population of the county
residing in the unincorporated area of the county bears to the total
population of the county, and second to the cities in the proportion that
the population of each city bears to the total population of the county,
except that no persons residing within the Fort Riley military
reservation shall be included in the determination of the population of
any city located within Riley county.
All revenue apportioned to a county shall be paid to its county
treasurer and shall be credited to the general fund of the county.
(b) (1) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in
subsection (a), all revenue received by the director of taxation from a
countywide retailers' sales tax imposed within Johnson county at the
rate of 0.75%, 1% or 1.25% after July 1, 2007, shall be apportioned
among the county and each city located in such county in the following
manner:
(A) The revenue received from the first 0.5% rate of tax shall be
apportioned in the manner prescribed by subsection (a); and
(B) the revenue received from the rate of tax exceeding 0.5% shall
be apportioned as follows:
(i) 1/ shall be apportioned among the county and each city located
4
in such county in the proportion that the total tangible property tax
levies made in such county in the preceding year for all funds of each
such governmental unit bear to the total of all such levies made in the
preceding year;
(ii) 1/ shall be apportioned among the county and each city
4
located in such county, first to the county that portion of the revenue
equal to the proportion that the population of the county residing in the
unincorporated area of the county bears to the total population of the
county, and second to the cities in the proportion that the population of
each city bears to the total population of the county; and
(iii) 1/ shall be retained by the county for its sole use and benefit.

(2) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection
(a), all money received by the director of taxation from a countywide
sales tax imposed within Montgomery county pursuant to the election
held on November 8, 1994, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by
the county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue
received from the tax was pledged. All revenue apportioned and paid
from the imposition of such tax to the treasurer of any city prior to the
effective date of this act shall be remitted to the county treasurer and
expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the
tax was pledged.
(3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection
(a), on and after the effective date of this act, all moneys received by
the director of taxation from a countywide retailers' sales tax imposed
within Phillips county pursuant to the election held on September 20,
2005, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the
tax was pledged.
(c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total

HOUSE BILL No. 2275—page 15
tangible property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax
revenue derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible
property located within each such city or county. The ad valorem
property tax levy of any county or city district entity or subdivision
shall be included within this term if the levy of any such district entity
or subdivision is applicable to all tangible property located within each
such city or county.
(2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for
the purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be
included within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such
city regardless of its applicability to all tangible property located within
each such city. If the tax is levied by a district which extends across city
boundaries, for purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy
shall be apportioned among each city in which such district extends in
the proportion that such tax levied within each city bears to the total tax
levied by the district.
(d) (1) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I),
(6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (23),
(25), (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and,

tax authorized by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto,
includes the apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
(e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall
be paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general
fund of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or
more counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a
countywide retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy
countywide retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received
by such city from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as
an alternative to depositing the same in the general fund, may be used
for the purpose of reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable
tangible property located within the county levying such countywide
retailers' sales tax.
(f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall
advise each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county
from the state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.
(g) Prior to December 31 of each year, the clerk of every county
imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such
information deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion
and remit revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.

apportionment of countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any
revenues received pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales
tax levied or collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto.
All such revenue collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments
thereto, shall be deposited into the redevelopment bond fund
established by K.S.A. 74-8927, and amendments thereto, for the period
of time set forth in K.S.A. 74-8927, and amendments thereto.
Sec. 4. K.S.A. 79-3651 is hereby amended to read as follows: 79-

HOUSE BILL No. 2275—page 16
3651. (a) For the purpose of the proper administration of the Kansas
retailers' sales tax act and to prevent evasion of the tax imposed
thereunder, it shall be presumed that all gross receipts from the sale of
tangible personal property or enumerated services are subject to tax
until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale is not
subject to tax is upon the seller unless the seller takes from the
purchaser an exemption certificate to the effect that the property or
service purchased is not subject to tax.
(b) An exemption certificate shall relieve the seller from collecting
and remitting tax if the seller has obtained the required identifying
information as determined by the director, from the purchaser and the
reason for claiming the exemption at the time of purchase and has
maintained proper records of exempt transactions pursuant to
subsection (a) of K.S.A. 79-3609(a), and amendments thereto, and
provided them to the director when requested, except that no such relief
from liability shall apply to a seller who: Fraudulently fails to collect
the tax; solicits purchasers to participate in the unlawful claim of an
exemption; accepts an exemption certificate claiming an entity based
exemption when the subject of the transaction is actually received by
the purchaser at a location operated by the seller and the director
provides an exemption certificate that clearly and affirmatively
indicates that the claimed exemption is not available. The seller shall
obtain the same information for proof of a claimed exemption
regardless of the medium in which the transaction occurred. The
purchaser improperly claiming an exemption shall remain liable for the
nonpayment of tax.
(c) The exemption certificate shall be substantially in such form as
the director may prescribe. The seller shall use the standard form for
claiming an exemption electronically as adopted by the director. A
seller may require a purchaser to provide a copy of the purchaser's sales
tax registration certificate with a resale certificate as a condition for
honoring the purchaser's resale exemption claim, except that in the case
of drop shipment sales into this state, the third party vendor may claim
a resale exemption based on an exemption certificate provided by its
customer, re-seller, or any other information acceptable to the secretary
available to the third party vendor evidencing qualification for a resale
exemption, regardless of whether the customer, re-seller, is registered
to collect and remit sales and use tax in this state. A purchaser is not
required to provide a signature to claim an exemption from tax unless a
paper exemption certificate is used. A seller is relieved of liability for
the tax otherwise applicable if it obtains a blanket exemption certificate
for a purchaser with which the seller has a recurring business
relationship. Such blanket certificate need not be renewed or updated
by the seller for exemption certificate information or data elements
when there is a recurring business relationship between the buyer and
seller. For purposes of this subsection, a recurring business relationship
exists when a period of no more than 12 months elapses between sales
transactions.
(d) To lawfully present a resale exemption certificate the
purchaser must be engaged in the business of selling property or
services of the same kind that is purchased, hold a registration
certificate, except as otherwise permitted in subsection (c) for drop
shipment sales into this state, and at the time of purchase, either intend
to resell the property in the regular course of business or be unable to
ascertain whether the property will be resold or used for some other
purpose. A resale exemption certificate may be used for resale of
services to tangible personal property and not for services to real
property.
(e) Any person who issues a resale certificate or other exemption
certificate in order to unlawfully avoid payment of tax for business or
personal gain shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction
shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment
for not more than one year, or by both. In addition, if the director
determines that a person issued a resale certificate in order to

HOUSE BILL No. 2275—page 17
unlawfully avoid payment of tax for business or personal gain, the
director shall increase any penalty that is due from the person under
K.S.A. 79-3615, and amendments thereto, by $250 or 10 times the tax
due, whichever is greater, on each transaction where the misuse of a
resale certificate occurred.
(f) Exemption certificates issued by an entity claiming a specific
exemption under K.S.A. 79-3606, and amendments thereto, based on
the status of the entity shall bear the name, address of the entity and
identification number issued to the entity pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3692,
and amendments thereto. Such certificate shall be signed by an
authorized person of the nonprofit entity, if in paper form, and contain
the tax identification number of the entity. The certificate shall be
substantially in such form as the director may prescribe. A seller may
require that payments be made on an exempt entity's check, warrant,
voucher or charged to the entity's account as a condition for honoring
the entity's exemption claim.
(g) It shall be the duty of every person who purchases tangible
personal property or services that are taxable under this act to pay the
full amount of tax that is lawfully due to the retailer making the sale.
Any person who willfully and intentionally refuses to pay such tax to
the retailer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall
be punished and fined as provided by subsection (g) of K.S.A. 79-
3615(h), and amendments thereto.
(h) On and after July 1, 2024, notwithstanding any provisions to
the contrary in this section or any other provision of law, purchasers
claiming an exemption pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3606(rrrr), and
amendments thereto, shall not be required to provide an exemption
certificate or form to the seller, and the seller shall not be required to
receive and maintain a completed exemption certificate or form for
such exempt transactions. If the seller in the ordinary course of
business believes that the service qualifies for the exemption pursuant
to K.S.A. 79-3606(rrrr), and amendments thereto, the seller shall be
relieved from collecting and remitting the tax and shall not have the
burden of proving that the service is not subject to tax pursuant to
subsection (a). A purchaser improperly claiming the exemption shall
remain liable for the nonpayment of tax.
