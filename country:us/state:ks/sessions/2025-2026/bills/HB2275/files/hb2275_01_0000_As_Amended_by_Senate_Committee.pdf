21 effective date of this act shall be remitted to the county treasurer and
22 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the
23 tax was pledged.
24 (3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),
25 on and after the effective date of this act, all moneys received by the
26 director of taxation from a countywide retailers' sales tax imposed
27 within Phillips county pursuant to the election held on September 20,
28 2005, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
29 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the
30 tax was pledged.
31 (c) (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this
32 subsection, for purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the term "total
33 tangible property tax levies" means the aggregate dollar amount of tax
34 revenue derived from ad valorem tax levies applicable to all tangible
35 property located within each such city or county. The ad valorem
36 property tax levy of any county or city district entity or subdivision shall
37 be included within this term if the levy of any such district entity or
38 subdivision is applicable to all tangible property located within each
39 such city or county.
40 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
41 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for
42 the purpose of providing fire protection service in such city shall be
43 included within the term "total tangible property tax levies" for such city

HB 2275—Am. by SC 21
1 regardless of its applicability to all tangible property located within each
2 such city. If the tax is levied by a district which extends across city
3 boundaries, for purposes of this computation, the amount of such levy
4 shall be apportioned among each city in which such district extends in
5 the proportion that such tax levied within each city bears to the total tax
6 levied by the district.
7 (d) (1) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
8 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I),
9 (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (22), (23),
10 (25), (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and, (38)
11 and (39), and amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be
12 retained by the county and expended only for the purpose for which the
13 revenue received from the tax was pledged.
14 (2) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and
15 amendments thereto, all revenues received from a countywide retailers'
16 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
17 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
18 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the
19 tax was pledged.
20 (3) All revenue received from a countywide retailers' sales tax
21 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto,
22 shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and expended
23 only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was
24 pledged unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax
25 authorized by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes
26 the apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
27 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall
28 be paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general
29 fund of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or
30 more counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a
31 countywide retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy
32 countywide retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received
33 by such city from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as
34 an alternative to depositing the same in the general fund, may be used
35 for the purpose of reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable
36 tangible property located within the county levying such countywide
37 retailers' sales tax.
38 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall
39 advise each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county
40 from the state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.
41 (g) Prior to December 31 of each year, the clerk of every county
42 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such
43 information deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion

HB 2275—Am. by SC 22
1 and remit revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
2 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment
3 of countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues
4 received pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or
5 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such
6 revenue collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall
7 be deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
8 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.
9 74-8927, and amendments thereto.
10 Sec. 3. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-187 and, 12-189 and 12-192 are
11 hereby repealed.
12 Sec. 4. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
13 publication in the Kansas register.
