29 administer, enforce and collect such local sales taxes and to adopt such
30 rules and regulations as may be necessary for the efficient and effective
31 administration and enforcement thereof.
32 Upon receipt of a certified copy of an ordinance or resolution

HB 2275 18
1 cease collection of such sales tax until such noncompliance is remedied.

3 this section shall be credited to a county and city retailers' sales tax fund

5 moneys collected by the director of taxation pursuant to the authority
6 granted in K.S.A. 12-187(b)(22), and amendments thereto, shall be
7 credited to the Wilson county capital improvements fund. Any refund due
8 on any county or city retailers' sales tax collected pursuant to this act shall
9 be paid out of the sales tax refund fund and reimbursed by the director of
10 taxation from collections of local retailers' sales tax revenue. Except for
11 local retailers' sales tax revenue required to be deposited in the
12 redevelopment bond fund established under K.S.A. 74-8927, and
13 amendments thereto, all local retailers' sales tax revenue collected within
14 any county or city pursuant to this act shall be apportioned and remitted at
15 least quarterly by the state treasurer, on instruction from the director of
16 taxation, to the treasurer of such county or city.
17 Revenue that is received from the imposition of a local retailers' sales
18 tax that exceeds the amount of revenue required to pay the costs of a
19 special project for which such revenue was pledged shall be credited to the
20 city or county general fund, as the case requires.
21 The director of taxation shall provide, upon request by a city or county
22 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of any city or county levying a local
23 retailers' sales tax, monthly reports identifying each retailer doing business
24 in such city or county or making taxable sales sourced to such city or
25 county, setting forth the tax liability and the amount of such tax remitted
26 by each retailer during the preceding month and identifying each business
27 location maintained by the retailer and such retailer's sales or use tax
28 registration or account number. Such report shall be made available to the
29 clerk or treasurer or finance officer of such city or county within a
30 reasonable time after it has been requested from the director of taxation.
31 The director of taxation shall be allowed to assess a reasonable fee for the
32 issuance of such report. Information received by any city or county
33 pursuant to this section shall be confidential, and it shall be unlawful for
34 any officer or employee of such city or county to divulge any such
35 information in any manner. Any violation of this paragraph by a city or
36 county officer or employee is a class A misdemeanor, and such officer or
37 employee shall be dismissed from office. Reports of violations of this
38 paragraph shall be investigated by the attorney general. The district
39 attorney or county attorney and the attorney general shall have authority to
40 prosecute violations of this paragraph.
41 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-187 and 12-189 are hereby repealed.
42 Sec. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
43 publication in the Kansas register.
