16 land owned by a county without the express permission of the board of
17 county commissioners of the county other than as provided in subsection
18 (f).
19 (4) The land lies within or mainly within the city and has a common
20 perimeter with the city boundary line of more than 50%.
21 (5) The land if annexed will make the city boundary line straight or

3
25 city, except no tract in excess of 21 acres shall be annexed under this
26 condition.
27 (7) The land adjoins the city and a written petition for or consent to
28 annexation is filed with the city by the owner.
29 (b) No portion of any unplatted tract of land devoted to agricultural

33 (c) No city may annex, pursuant to this section, any improvement
34 district incorporated and organized pursuant to K.S.A. 19-2753 et seq., and
35 amendments thereto, or any land within such improvement district. The

3 (d) Subject to the provisions of this section and K.S.A. 12-520a(e),
4 and amendments thereto, a city may annex, pursuant to this section, any
5 fire district or any land within such fire district.
6 (e) No city may annex the right-of-way of any highway under the
7 authority of this section unless at the time of the annexation the abutting
8 property upon one or both sides thereof is already within the city or is
9 annexed to the city in the same proceeding. The board of county
10 commissioners may notify the city of the existence of the right-of-way of

19 (f) The governing body of any city by one ordinance may annex one
20 or more separate tracts or lands each of which conforms to any one or
21 more of the foregoing conditions. The invalidity of the annexation of any
22 tract or land in one ordinance shall not affect the validity of the remaining
23 tracts or lands which that are annexed by the ordinance and which that
24 conform to any one or more of the foregoing conditions.
25 (g) No city may utilize any provision of this section to annex a
26 narrow corridor of land to gain access to noncontiguous tracts of land. The

28 enhancing future annexations of land by the city.
29 (h) No tract of land owned by any federal or state agency or any
30 other governmental agency, or instrumentality thereof, except land owned
31 by the city, shall be considered contiguous to the boundary of such city for
32 purposes of any annexation conducted pursuant to this section.

37 amendments thereto, and any city whose nearest boundary line is located
38 within 1/ mile of the land being so annexed, within 30 days next following
2
39 the publication of the ordinance annexing the land, may maintain an action
40 in district court of the county in which the land is located challenging the
41 authority of the city to annex the land, whether the annexation was
42 reasonable, whether the service plan was adequate and the regularity of the
43 proceeding had in connection with the annexation procedures. When

SB 124 3
1 determining the reasonableness of an annexation in the case of a city
2 challenging the annexation, the court shall include in its considerations the
3 effect the annexation has on the future growth of the city challenging the
4 annexation.
5 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 12-520 and 12-538 are hereby repealed.
6 Sec. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
7 publication in the statute book.
