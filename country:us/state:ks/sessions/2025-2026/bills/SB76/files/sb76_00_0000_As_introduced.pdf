By Committee on Education
1-27
1 AN ACT concerning education; relating to employees of school districts
2 and postsecondary educational institutions; enacting the given name act
3 to require such employees to use the name and pronouns consistent
4 with a student's biological sex and birth certificate; authorizing a cause
5 of action for violations therefor.
6
7 WHEREAS, Employees of school districts and postsecondary
8 educational institutions do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom
9 of speech or expression at work; and
10 WHEREAS, Protecting the right to free speech for such employees
11 promotes the important interests of students receiving informed opinions
12 on matters of public concern, employee rights to disseminate their own
13 opinions and exposing our children and future leaders to different
14 viewpoints; and
15 WHEREAS, The selection and use of pronouns in classrooms, on
16 campuses and elsewhere is not merely an administrative or ministerial act,
17 but instead is a matter of free speech and academic freedom as it
18 communicates a message on a matter of public concern and shapes
19 classroom discussion and debate.
