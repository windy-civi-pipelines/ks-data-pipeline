16 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
17 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of

19 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
20 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
21 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
22 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or

42 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
43 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in

1 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
2 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
3 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
4 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
5 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
