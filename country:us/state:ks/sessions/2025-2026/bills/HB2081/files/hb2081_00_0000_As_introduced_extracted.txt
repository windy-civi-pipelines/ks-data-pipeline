38 for-profit corporation. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to
39 exempt the purchase of any construction machinery, equipment or tools
40 used in the constructing, equipping, reconstructing, maintaining, repairing,
41 enlarging, furnishing or remodeling a building for such eligible not-for-
42 profit corporation. When such eligible not-for-profit corporation contracts
43 for the purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing, maintaining,
HB 2081 43
1 repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling a building, such corporation
2 shall obtain from the state and furnish to the contractor an exemption
3 certificate for the project involved, and such contractor may purchase
4 materials for incorporation in such project. The contractor shall furnish the
5 number of such certificate to all suppliers from whom such purchases are
6 made, and such suppliers shall execute invoices covering such purchases
7 bearing the number of such certificate. Upon completion of the project, the
8 contractor shall furnish to such eligible not-for-profit corporation a sworn
9 statement, on a form to be provided by the director of taxation, that all
10 purchases so made were entitled to exemption under this subsection. All
11 invoices shall be held by the contractor for a period of five years and shall
12 be subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any materials purchased
13 under such a certificate are found not to have been incorporated in the
14 building or returned for credit, the contractor shall report and pay the sales
15 or compensating tax to the director of taxation not later than the 20th day of
16 the month following the close of the month in which it is determined that
17 such materials will not be used for the purpose for which such certificate
18 was issued. The eligible not-for-profit corporation concerned shall be
19 liable for tax on all materials purchased for the project, and upon payment
20 thereof, the eligible not-for-profit corporation may recover the same from
21 the contractor together with reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or
22 any agent, employee or subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise
23 dispose of any materials purchased under such a certificate for any purpose
24 other than that for which such a certificate is issued without the payment
25 of the sales or compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials
26 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be
27 subject to the penalties provided for in K.S.A. 79-3615(h), and
28 amendments thereto.
29 (2) Sales tax paid on and after May 19, 2023, but prior to the effective
30 date of this act upon the gross receipts received from any sale which would
31 have been exempted by the provisions of this subsection had such sale
32 occurred after the effective date of this act shall be refunded. Each claim
33 for a sales tax refund shall be verified and submitted to the director of
34 taxation upon forms furnished by the director and shall be accompanied by
35 any additional documentation required by the director. The director shall
36 review each claim and shall refund that amount of sales tax paid as
37 determined under the provisions of this subsection. All refunds shall be
38 paid from the sales tax refund fund upon warrants of the director of
39 accounts and reports pursuant to vouchers approved by the director or the
40 director's designee; and
41 (wwww) (1) All sales of tangible personal property or services
42 purchased by a pregnancy resource center or residential maternity facility.

31 enlarging, furnishing or remodeling facilities for any political subdivision

33 paid from funds of such political subdivision or district and that would be
34 exempt from taxation under the provisions of this act if purchased directly
35 by such political subdivision or district. Nothing in this subsection or in

18 institution or department of corrections concerned a sworn statement, on a
19 form to be provided by the director of taxation, that all purchases so made
20 were entitled to exemption under this subsection. As an alternative to the
21 foregoing procedure, any such contracting entity may apply to the
22 secretary of revenue for agent status for the sole purpose of issuing and

24 and regulations adopted by the secretary establishing conditions and
25 standards for the granting and maintaining of such status. All invoices
26 shall be held by the contractor for a period of five years and shall be
27 subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any materials purchased

31 be so incorporated in the building or other project reported and paid by
32 such contractor to the director of taxation not later than the 20th day of the
33 month following the close of the month in which it shall be determined
34 that such materials will not be used for the purpose for which such
35 certificate was issued, the political subdivision, district described in
36 subsection (s), hospital or public hospital authority, school, educational
37 institution or the contractor contracting with the department of corrections
38 for a correctional institution concerned shall be liable for tax on all
39 materials purchased for the project, and upon payment thereof it may
40 recover the same from the contractor together with reasonable attorney
41 fees. Any contractor or any agent, employee or subcontractor thereof, who
42 shall use or otherwise dispose of any materials purchased under such a
