1 (1) Are limited to the sale of lawful goods and services; and
2 (2) occur inside the residential dwelling or within the property limits.
3 Sec. 3. The use of a residential dwelling for a no-impact home-based
4 business or a rural no-impact home-based business shall be a permitted
5 use. This permitted use shall supersede any deed restriction, covenant or
6 agreement restricting the use of land or any master deed, bylaw or other
7 document applicable to a common interest ownership community entered
8 into by a no-impact home-based business or a rural no-impact home-based
9 business on or after July 1, 2025, except that this permitted use shall not
10 supersede the bylaws of a home owners association if there is a clear
11 directly applicable restriction and reasonable likelihood that the
12 business activities of the no-impact home-based business or rural no-
13 impact home-based business are likely not to be consistently compliant
14 with the requirements of this act.
15 Sec. 4. A municipality shall not prohibit a no-impact home-based
16 business or a rural no-impact home-based business or otherwise require a
17 person to apply, register or obtain any permit, license, variance or other
18 type of prior approval from the municipality to operate a no-impact home-
19 based business or a rural no-impact home-based business.
20 Sec. 5. A municipality may establish or enforce regulations on a no-
21 impact home-based business if the regulations are narrowly tailored for
22 any of the following purposes:
23 (a) The protection of the public health and safety limited to
24 regulations for fire and building codes, health and sanitation,
25 transportation or traffic control, solid or hazardous waste, pollution and
26 noise control;
27 (b) compliance with state and federal laws; and
28 (c) payment of applicable taxes.
29 When considering the establishment or enforcement of a regulation in a
30 narrowly tailored manner with respect to a rural no-impact home-based
31 business, the municipality shall identify factors differentiating the
32 circumstances of a rural no-impact home-based business as compared to
33 residences that are no-impact home-based businesses, including, but not
34 limited to, the relative isolation of the rural no-impact home-based
35 business, relative size of the premises and proximity to other residences
36 and shall apply an analysis favoring less regulation for a rural no-impact
37 home-based business based on such factors.
38 Sec. 6. A no-impact home-based business shall not be used for the
39 purposes of selling illegal drugs or liquor, operating or maintaining a
40 structured sober living home for drug or alcohol based recovery, selling
41 pornography or providing nude or topless dancing or other adult-oriented
42 businesses.
43 Sec. 7. A municipality shall not require a person as a condition of

HB 2343—Am. by HC 3
1 operating a no-impact home-based business or a rural no-impact home-
2 based business to seek rezoning of the property for commercial use or
3 install fire sprinklers in a single family detached residential dwelling, any
4 residential dwelling consisting of more than two dwelling units or any
5 additional buildings on the property. A municipality shall not require a
6 rural no-impact home-based business or a no-impact home-based business
7 to undergo fire or building inspections, unless such codes or inspections
8 are also applied to similar residences not operating a rural no-impact
9 home-based business or a no-impact home-based business.
10 Sec. 8. The question of whether a regulation of a municipality
11 complies with this act shall be a judicial question. The municipality that
12 enacted the regulation shall establish by clear and convincing evidence
13 that the regulation complies with this act.
14 Sec. 9. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
15 publication in the statute book.
