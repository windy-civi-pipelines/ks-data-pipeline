5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 25-1122 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 25-1122. (a) Any registered voter may file with the county
9 election officer where such person is a resident, or where such person is
10 authorized by law to vote as a former precinct resident, an application for
11 an advance voting ballot. The signed application shall be transmitted only
12 to the county election officer by personal delivery, mail, facsimile or as
13 otherwise provided by law.
14 (b) If the registered voter is applying for an advance voting ballot to
15 be transmitted in person, the voter shall provide identification pursuant to
16 K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto.
17 (c) If the registered voter is applying for an advance voting ballot to
18 be transmitted by mail, the voter shall provide with the application for an
19 advance voting ballot the voter's current and valid Kansas driver's license
20 number, nondriver's identification card number or a photocopy of any
21 other identification provided by K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto.
22 (d) A voter may vote a provisional ballot according to K.S.A. 25-409,
23 and amendments thereto, if:
24 (1) The voter is unable or refuses to provide current and valid
25 identification; or
26 (2) the name and address of the voter provided on the application for
27 an advance voting ballot do not match the voter's name and address on the
28 registration book. The voter shall provide a valid form of identification as
29 defined in K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto, to the county election
30 officer in person or provide a copy by mail or electronic means before the
31 meeting of the county board of canvassers. At the meeting of the county
32 board of canvassers the county election officer shall present copies of
33 identification received from provisional voters and the corresponding
34 provisional ballots. If the county board of canvassers determines that a
35 voter's identification is valid and the provisional ballot was properly cast,

HB 2269 2
1 the ballot shall be counted.
2 (e) No county election officer shall provide an advance voting ballot
3 to a person who is requesting an advance voting ballot to be transmitted by
4 mail unless:
5 (1) The county election official verifies that the signature of the
6 person matches that on file in the county voter registration records, except
7 that verification of the voter's signature shall not be required if a voter has
8 a disability preventing the voter from signing. Signature verification may
9 occur by electronic device or by human inspection. In the event that the
10 signature of a person who is requesting an advance voting ballot does not
11 match that on file, the county election officer shall attempt to contact the
12 person and shall offer the person another opportunity to provide the
13 person's signature for the purposes of verifying the person's identity. If the
14 county election officer is unable to reach the person, the county election
15 officer may transmit a provisional ballot, however, such provisional ballot
16 may not be counted unless a signature is included therewith that can be
17 verified; and
18 (2) the person provides such person's full Kansas driver's license
19 number, Kansas nondriver's identification card number issued by the
20 division of vehicles, or submits such person's application for an advance
21 voting ballot and a copy of identification provided by K.S.A. 25-2908, and
22 amendments thereto, to the county election officer for verification. If a
23 person applies for an advance voting ballot to be transmitted by mail but
24 fails to provide identification pursuant to this subsection or the
25 identification of the person cannot be verified by the county election
26 officer, the county election officer shall provide information to the person
27 regarding the voter rights provisions of subsection (d) and shall provide
28 the person an opportunity to provide identification pursuant to this
29 subsection. For the purposes of this act, Kansas state offices and offices of
30 any subdivision of the state will allow any person seeking to vote by an
31 advance voting ballot the use of a photocopying device to make one
32 photocopy of an identification document at no cost.
33 (f) (1) Applications for advance voting ballots to be transmitted to the
34 voter by mail shall be filed only at the following times:
35 (A) For the primary election occurring on the first Tuesday in August
36 in both even-numbered and odd-numbered years, between April 1 of such
37 year and the Tuesday of the week preceding such primary election;

15 applications prior to the time specified in this subsection and hold such
16 applications until the beginning of the prescribed application period. Such
17 applications shall be treated as filed on that date.

19 office, applications for advance voting ballots transmitted to the voter in
20 person shall be filed on the Tuesday next preceding the election and on
21 each subsequent business day until no later than 12 12:00 noon on the day
22 preceding such election. If the county election officer so provides,
23 applications for advance voting ballots transmitted to the voter in person in
24 the office of the county election officer also may be filed on the Saturday

26 application, the county election officer shall deliver to the voter such

31 filed during the regular advance ballot application periods until the close
32 of the polls on election day.
33 (3) (A) The county election officer may designate places other than

37 the voter in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as
38 otherwise provided by this subsection.
39 (B) The county election commissioners in Johnson, Sedgwick,
40 Shawnee and Wyandotte counties shall designate at least three satellite

35 will be removed from the permanent advance voting list unless the voter
36 renews the application for permanent advance voting status within 30 days
37 after the notice is mailed. If the voter fails to renew such application, the
38 county election officer shall remove the voter's name from the permanent
39 advance voting list. Failure to renew the application for permanent
40 advance voting status shall not result in removal of the voter's name from
41 the voter registration list.

43 application for an advance voting ballot and includes an application for an
