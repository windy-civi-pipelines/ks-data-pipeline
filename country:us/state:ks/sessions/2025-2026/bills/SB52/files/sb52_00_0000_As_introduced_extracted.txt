24 be claimed by the transferee against the transferee's Kansas income tax
25 liability in the taxable year the credit was transferred. The amount of the
26 transferred credit that exceeds the transferee's tax liability for such year
27 may be carried over for deduction from the transferee's income tax liability
28 in the next succeeding taxable year or years until the total amount of the
29 tax credit has been deducted from the transferee's tax liability, except that

31 year succeeding the taxable year in which the credit was transferred to the

4 or compensating tax to the director of taxation not later than the 20th day of
5 the month following the close of the month in which it is determined that
6 such materials will not be used for the purpose for which such certificate
7 was issued. The eligible not-for-profit corporation concerned shall be
8 liable for tax on all materials purchased for the project, and upon payment
9 thereof, the eligible not-for-profit corporation may recover the same from
10 the contractor together with reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or
11 any agent, employee or subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise
12 dispose of any materials purchased under such a certificate for any purpose
13 other than that for which such a certificate is issued without the payment
14 of the sales or compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials

22 for a sales tax refund shall be verified and submitted to the director of
23 taxation upon forms furnished by the director and shall be accompanied by
24 any additional documentation required by the director. The director shall
25 review each claim and shall refund that amount of sales tax paid as

17 commerce as provided by section 3, and amendments thereto.
18 (2) When a production company contracts for construction,
19 reconstruction, enlargement or remodeling of any facility for purposes of a
20 certified project that constitutes a production or postproduction
21 expenditure, the production company shall obtain from the state and
22 furnish to the contractor an exemption certificate for the certified project,
23 and the contractor may purchase materials, machinery and equipment for
24 incorporation in such project. The contractor shall furnish the number of
25 such certificates to all suppliers from whom such purchases are made, and
26 such suppliers shall execute invoices covering such purchases bearing the
27 number of such certificate. Upon completion of the work, the contractor
28 shall furnish to the owner of the production company a sworn statement,
29 on a form to be provided by the director of taxation, that all purchases so
30 made were entitled to exemption under this subsection and section 3, and
31 amendments thereto. All invoices shall be held by the contractor for a
32 period of five years and subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any
33 materials purchased under such a certificate are found not to have been
34 incorporated in facilities or returned for credit, the contractor shall report
35 and pay the sales or compensating tax on such materials to the director of
36 taxation not later than the 20th day of the month following the close of the
37 month in which a determination is made that such materials will not be
38 used for the purpose for which such certificate was issued. If the
39 contractor fails to make such payment for such materials to the director of
40 taxation, the production company concerned shall be liable for tax on all
41 such materials purchased for the project, and upon payment thereof, the
42 production company may recover the amount of the tax paid from the
43 contractor together with reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or any
SB 52 58
1 agent, employee or subcontractor thereof who uses or otherwise disposes
2 of any materials, machinery or equipment purchased under such a
3 certificate for any purpose other than that for which such a certificate is
4 issued without the payment of the sales or compensating tax otherwise
5 imposed thereon shall be guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor and, upon
6 conviction therefor, shall be subject to the penalties provided for in K.S.A.
7 79-3615(h), and amendments thereto.
8 (3) As used in this subsection, "certified project," "postproduction
9 expenditure," "production company" and "production expenditure" mean

31 liability for the taxable year, the production company may carry over the
32 amount of the tax credit that exceeds such tax liability for deduction from
33 the production company's income tax liability in the next succeeding

35 deducted from the production company's tax liability, except that no such
36 tax credit shall be carried over for deduction after the 10th taxable year
