39 (d) Any qualified investor who receives a tax credit pursuant to this
40 section shall be deemed to acquire an interest in the nature of a
41 transferable credit limited to the amount of the credit issued to the
42 qualified investor by the director. All or a portion of such credit may be
43 transferred by the qualified investor or any subsequent transferee to one or

5 cash investment was originally made by the qualified investor. The credit
6 may be carried forward as permitted by subsection (a). There shall be no

13 transfer. Documentation of any credit acquired by transfer shall be
14 provided by the taxpayer claiming such credit in the manner required by
15 the secretary of revenue. The qualified investor or subsequent transferee

28 apply retroactively to any credits issued for tax year 2022 and all tax
