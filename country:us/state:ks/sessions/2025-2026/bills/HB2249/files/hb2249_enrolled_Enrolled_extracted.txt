a finding prior to the hearing that the presence of the proposed ward or
ward will be injurious to the person's health or welfare, that the

meaningfully participate in the proceedings or that the proposed ward
or ward has filed with the court a written waiver of such ward's right to
appear in person. In any such case, the court shall enter in the record of
the proceedings the facts upon which the court has found that the
presence of the proposed ward or ward at the hearing should be
excused. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, if
the proposed ward or ward files with the court at least one day prior to
the date of the hearing a written notice stating the person's desire to be
present at the hearing, the court shall order that the person must be

by the court. Any appointment made by the court shall terminate upon a
final determination of the petition and any appeal therefrom, unless the
court continues the appointment by further order.
(4) An order fixing the date, time and a place that is in the best
interest of the proposed ward or ward at which the proposed ward or
ward shall have the opportunity to consult with such ward's attorney.
This consultation shall be scheduled to occur prior to the time at which
the examination and evaluation ordered pursuant to subsection (d)(1), if
ordered, is scheduled to occur.
(5) A notice similar to that provided for in K.S.A. 59-3066, and

and evaluation of the proposed ward or ward as provided for in

guardian or guardian to admit the proposed ward or ward to a treatment
facility and to consent to the care and treatment of the proposed ward or
ward therein. Any such order shall expire immediately after the hearing

which the order would otherwise expire.

an order of advancement, continuance or a change of place of the
hearing has been issued pursuant to subsection (d). The petitioner and
the proposed ward or ward shall each be afforded an opportunity to
appear at the hearing, to testify and to present and cross-examine
witnesses. If the hearing has been consolidated with a trial being held
pursuant to either the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons or
the care and treatment act for persons with an alcohol or substance
abuse problem, persons not necessary for the conduct of the
proceedings may be excluded as provided for in those acts. The hearing
shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with
orderly procedure. The court shall have the authority to receive all
relevant and material evidence which may be offered, including the
testimony or written report, findings or recommendations of any
professional or other person who has examined or evaluated the
proposed ward or ward pursuant to any order issued by the court
pursuant to subsection (d). Such evidence shall not be privileged for the
purpose of this hearing.
(f) Upon completion of the hearing, if the court finds by clear and
convincing evidence that the criteria set out in K.S.A. 39-1803, 59-

and after a careful consideration of reasonable alternatives to admission
of the proposed ward or ward to a treatment facility, the court may
enter an order granting such authority to the temporary guardian or
guardian as is appropriate, including continuing authority to the
guardian to readmit the ward to an appropriate treatment facility as may
later become necessary. Any such grant of continuing authority shall
expire two years after the date of final discharge of the ward from such
a treatment facility if the ward has not had to be readmitted to a
treatment facility during that two-year period of time. Thereafter, any
such grant of continuing authority may be renewed only after the filing
of another petition seeking authority in compliance with the provision
of this section.
(g) Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prohibit the head of
a treatment facility from admitting a proposed ward or ward to that
facility as a voluntary patient if the head of the treatment facility is
satisfied that the proposed ward or ward at that time has the capacity to
understand such ward's illness and need for treatment, and to consent to
such ward's admission and treatment. Upon any such admission, the
head of the treatment facility shall give notice to the temporary
guardian or guardian as soon as possible of the ward's admission, and
HOUSE BILL No. 2249—page 24
shall provide to the temporary guardian or guardian copies of any
consents the proposed ward or ward has given. Thereafter, the
temporary guardian or guardian shall timely either seek to obtain
proper authority pursuant to this section to admit the proposed ward or
ward to a treatment facility and to consent to further care and treatment,
or shall otherwise assume responsibility for the care of the proposed
ward or ward, consistent with the authority of the temporary guardian
or guardian, and may arrange for the discharge from the facility of the
