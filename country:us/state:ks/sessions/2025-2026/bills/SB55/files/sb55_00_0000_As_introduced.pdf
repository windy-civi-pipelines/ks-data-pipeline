41 supervisory or other public official, or knowingly making, publishing,
42 disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before
43 the public, or knowingly causing directly or indirectly, to be made,

1 published, disseminated, circulated, delivered to any person, or placed

10 agency company stock or other capital stock, or benefit certificates or
11 shares in any common-law corporation, or securities or any special or
12 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns
13 and profits as an inducement to insurance. Nothing herein shall prohibit
14 the acts permitted by K.S.A. 40-232, and amendments thereto.
15 (7) Unfair discrimination. (a) Making or permitting any unfair

18 or in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the
19 terms and conditions of such contract.
20 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between
21 individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the

23 of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in
24 any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner

30 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
31 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
32 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
33 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
34 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
35 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
36 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
37 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
38 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

2 may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
3 (d)(v) (7)(d)(vi).
4 (i) As used in this paragraph, "abuse" as used in this paragraph
5 means one or more acts defined in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments
6 thereto, between family members, current or former household members,
7 or current or former intimate partners.
8 (i)(ii) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and
9 health insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been
10 or may be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason
11 to seek medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for
12 abuse, protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
13 (ii)(iii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
14 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
15 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
16 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
17 insurance policy.
18 (iii)(iv) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to
19 an individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse
20 shall be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries
21 suffered by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
22 (iv)(v) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
23 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
24 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
25 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
26 based on sound actuarial principles.
27 (v)(vi) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
28 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
29 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
30 provided that:
31 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
32 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
33 of abuse;
34 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
35 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
36 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
37 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
38 (vi)(vii) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
39 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)(v)
40 (7)(d)(vi), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse
41 underwriting decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments
42 thereto.
43 (vii)(viii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies

SB 55 5
1 of life and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the
2 effective date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or
3 after the effective date of this act.
4 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
5 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
6 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
7 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
8 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
9 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
10 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
11 donors.
12 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
13 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
14 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to

16 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
17 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any
18 rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage
19 in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or
20 inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or giving, selling,
21 purchasing or offering to give, sell or purchase as inducement to such
22 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
23 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
24 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
25 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
26 (b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including
27 within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the following
28 practices:
29 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
30 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
31 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
32 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
33 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
34 policyholders;
35 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
36 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
37 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
38 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
39 expenses;
40 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
41 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
42 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be

5 (v) the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through
6 employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
7 products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services
8 are not specified in the policy of insurance if the product or service:
9 (A) Relates to the insurance coverage; and
10 (B) is primarily designed to satisfy one or more of the following:
11 (1) Provide loss mitigation or loss control;
12 (2) reduce claim costs or claim settlement costs;
13 (3) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons or
14 property;
15 (4) monitor or assess risk, identify sources of risk or develop
16 strategies for eliminating or reducing risk;
17 (5) enhance health;
18 (6) enhance financial wellness through items such as education or
19 financial planning services;
20 (7) provide post-loss services;

27 insurance coverage.
28 (C) The cost to the insurer or producer offering the product or service
29 to any given customer shall be reasonable in comparison to such

31 (D) If the insurer or producer is providing the product or service
32 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
33 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with
34 questions regarding the product or service.

40 (F) The availability of the value-added product or service shall be
41 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
42 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
43 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.

SB 55 7
1 (G) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
2 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
3 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
4 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
5 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall
6 notify the commissioner of such a pilot or testing program offered to
7 consumers in this state prior to launching and may proceed with the

10 (A) Offer or give non-cash gifts, items or services, including meals to

13 the cost does not exceed an amount determined to be reasonable by the
14 commissioner per policy year per term. The offer shall be made in a

16 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
17 for the gift, item or service.

19 as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the drawing
20 or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance, the prizes are
21 not valued in excess of a reasonable amount determined by the
22 commissioner and the drawing or raffle is open to the public. The raffle or
23 drawing shall be offered in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory.
24 The customer shall not be required to purchase, continue to purchase or
25 renew a policy in exchange for the gift, item or service.
26 (c) An insurer, producer or representative of an insurer or producer
27 shall not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the purchase of

30 practice if any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining

22 report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of
23 loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same
24 information;
25 (m) failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become
26 reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in

19 insurance business, any rebate, reduction or abatement of any rate or
20 charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance, any special favor
21 or advantage not generally available to others of the same classification, or
22 any money, thing of value or other consideration or material inducement.
23 The words "charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance"
24 includes, without limitations, escrow, settlement and closing charges.
25 (b) No insured named in a title insurance policy or contract nor any
26 other person directly or indirectly connected with the transaction involving
27 the issuance of the policy or contract, including, but not limited to,
28 mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, attorney or any officer,
29 employee, agent representative or solicitor thereof, or any other person

3 the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a
4 finder's fee.
5 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) through (14)(i), unless the context
6 otherwise requires:
7 (i) "Associate" means:

22 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
23 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
24 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
25 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
26 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
27 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
28 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
29 business.
30 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
31 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
32 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,

37 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
38 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
39 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
40 money with such interest as security.
41 (v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any
42 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
43 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained

SB 55 11
1 with respect to the referral.
2 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
3 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
4 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
5 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
6 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
7 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
8 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
9 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
10 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
11 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
12 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
13 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
14 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
15 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
16 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
17 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The

19 involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by
20 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
21 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
22 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent
23 shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which
24 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
25 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
26 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
27 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
28 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
29 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
30 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
31 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
32 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
33 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
34 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
35 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
36 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
37 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
38 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
39 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
40 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
41 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
42 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges

2 to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate
3 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
4 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
5 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or

7 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed
8 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment
9 having been made to such title insurer or agent.

12 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
13 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
14 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
15 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
16 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
17 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to
18 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
19 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
20 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
21 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
22 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
23 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
24 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
25 realized from such financial interest, so long as:
26 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
27 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
28 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
29 the referral of business; and
30 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
31 on the investment of the producer or associate.
32 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
33 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
34 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
35 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
36 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
37 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
38 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
39 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
40 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
41 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
42 to the premium for the title insurance.
43 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title

SB 55 13
1 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
2 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
3 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
4 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
5 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
6 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this
7 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of
8 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.
9 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide
10 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
11 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
12 to carry out the provisions of this act.
13 (15) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
14 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
15 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law
16 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
17 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent
18 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
19 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
20 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
21 information regulation".
22 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
23 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
24 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
25 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
26 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
27 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
28 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-2404 is hereby repealed.

30 publication in the statute book.
