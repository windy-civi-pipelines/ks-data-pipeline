38 to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott,

15 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns

34 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
35 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
36 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
37 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
38 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
39 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
40 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
41 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

6 subsection (7)(d)(v). "Abuse" As used in this paragraph, "abuse" means
7 one or more acts defined in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto,

9 current or former intimate partners.
10 (i) An insurer may shall not ask an applicant for life or accident and
11 health insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been
12 or may be the subject of domestic abuse, or seeks, has sought or had
13 reason to seek medical or psychological treatment or counseling
14 specifically for abuse, protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
15 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
16 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
17 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
18 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
19 insurance policy.
20 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
21 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
22 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
23 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
24 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
25 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
26 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
27 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
28 based on sound actuarial principles.
29 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
30 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
31 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
32 provided that:
33 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
34 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
35 of abuse;
36 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
37 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
38 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
39 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
40 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
41 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
42 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
43 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.

HB 2042—Am. by SC 7
1 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life

5 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
6 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
7 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
8 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
9 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
10 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
11 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
12 donors.
13 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
14 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
15 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to

23 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
24 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
25 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
26 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
27 (b) Nothing in subsection (7)(a) or (8)(a) shall be construed as
28 including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the
29 following practices:
30 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
31 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
32 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
33 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
34 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
35 policyholders;
36 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
37 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
38 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
39 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
40 expenses;
41 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
42 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
43 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be

15 property;

33 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
34 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with

42 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
43 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by

HB 2042—Am. by SC 9
1 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
2 (G) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
3 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in

37 (iii) the payment of reasonable entertainment and advertising
38 expenses.
39 (d) Nothing in this section prohibits the division of rates and charges
40 between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or one or more
41 title insurance companies and one or more title insurance agents, if such
42 division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate under
43 the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a

HB 2042—Am. by SC 12
1 finder's fee.
2 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) through (14)(i), unless the context
3 otherwise requires:
4 (i) "Associate" means any firm, association, organization, partnership,
5 business trust, corporation or other legal entity organized for profit in
6 which a producer of title business is a director, officer or partner thereof,
7 or owner of a financial interest; the spouse or any relative within the
8 second degree by blood or marriage of a producer of title business who is a
9 natural person; any director, officer or employee of a producer of title
10 business or associate; any legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
11 under common control with a producer of title business or associate; and
12 any natural person or legal entity with whom a producer of title business or
13 associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding or pursues any
14 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
15 of this section.
16 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
17 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
18 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
19 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
20 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
21 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
22 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
23 business.
24 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
25 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
26 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
27 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or
28 capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business,
29 occupation or profession of:
30 (A) Buying or selling interests in real property;
31 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
32 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
33 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
34 money with such interest as security.
35 (v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any
36 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
37 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
38 with respect to the referral.
39 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
40 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
41 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
42 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
43 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent

HB 2042—Am. by SC 13
1 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
2 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
3 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
4 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
5 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
6 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
7 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
8 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
9 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
10 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
11 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The
12 prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall not apply to transactions
13 involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by
14 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
15 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
16 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent
17 shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which
18 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
19 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
20 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
21 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
22 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
23 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
24 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
25 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
26 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
27 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
28 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
29 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
30 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
31 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
32 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
33 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
34 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
35 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
36 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges
37 generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services. Such
38 disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated
39 to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate
40 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
41 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
42 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
43 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers

HB 2042—Am. by SC 14
1 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed
2 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment
3 having been made to such title insurer or agent.
4 (2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall
5 require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any
6 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
7 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
8 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
9 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
10 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
11 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to
12 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
13 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
14 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
15 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
16 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
17 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
18 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
19 realized from such financial interest, so long as:
20 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
21 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
22 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
23 the referral of business; and
24 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
25 on the investment of the producer or associate.
26 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
27 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
28 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
29 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
30 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
31 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
32 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
33 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
34 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
35 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
36 to the premium for the title insurance.
37 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
38 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
39 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
40 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
41 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
42 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
43 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this

HB 2042—Am. by SC 15
1 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of
2 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.
3 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide
4 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
5 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
6 to carry out the provisions of this act.
7 (15) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
8 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
9 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law
10 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
11 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent
12 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
13 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
14 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
15 information regulation".
16 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
17 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
18 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
19 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
20 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
21 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
22 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-1139 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-1137 and 40-2404
23 are hereby repealed.
24 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after
25 January 1, 2026, and its publication in the statute book Kansas register.
