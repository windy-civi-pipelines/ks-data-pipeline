20 terms and conditions of such contract.
21 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between

32 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
33 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
34 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
35 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
36 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
37 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
38 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
39 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.

4 subsection (7)(d)(v). "Abuse" As used in this paragraph, "abuse" means
5 one or more acts defined in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto,
6 between family members, current or former household members, or
7 current or former intimate partners.
8 (i) An insurer may shall not ask an applicant for life or accident and
9 health insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been
10 or may be the subject of domestic abuse, or seeks, has sought or had
11 reason to seek medical or psychological treatment or counseling
12 specifically for abuse, protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
13 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
14 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
15 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
16 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
17 insurance policy.
18 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
19 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
20 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
21 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
22 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
23 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
24 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
25 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
26 based on sound actuarial principles.
27 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
28 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
29 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
30 provided that:
31 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
32 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
33 of abuse;
34 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
35 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
36 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
37 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
38 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
39 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
40 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
41 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
42 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
43 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective

HB 2042 7
1 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
2 effective date of this act.
3 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
4 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
5 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
6 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
7 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
8 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
9 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
10 donors.
11 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
12 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
13 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to
14 such contract other than as plainly expressed in the insurance contract
15 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
16 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any
17 rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage

19 inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or giving, selling,
20 purchasing or offering to give, sell or purchase as inducement to such
21 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
22 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
23 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
24 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
25 (b) Nothing in subsection (7)(a) or (8)(a) shall be construed as
26 including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the
27 following practices:
28 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
29 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
30 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
31 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
32 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
33 policyholders;
34 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
35 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
36 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
37 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
38 expenses;
39 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
40 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
41 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be
42 made retroactive only for such policy year;
43 (iv) engaging in an arrangement that would not violate section 106 of

3 home owners' loan act;

13 property;

17 (6) enhance financial wellness through items such as education or
18 financial planning services;
19 (7) provide post-loss services;
20 (8) (a) incentivize behavioral changes to improve the health or reduce
21 the risk of death or disability of a customer;

31 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
32 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with
33 questions regarding the product or service.

35 implementing the permitted practices set forth in this section to ensure

40 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
41 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
42 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
43 (G) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but

HB 2042 9
1 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
2 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
3 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
4 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall

21 report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of
22 loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same
23 information;
24 (m) failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become
25 reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in

39 title insurance companies and one or more title insurance agents, if such
40 division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate under
41 the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a
42 finder's fee.
43 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) through (14)(i), unless the context

HB 2042 12
1 otherwise requires:
2 (i) "Associate" means any firm, association, organization, partnership,
3 business trust, corporation or other legal entity organized for profit in
4 which a producer of title business is a director, officer or partner thereof,
5 or owner of a financial interest; the spouse or any relative within the
6 second degree by blood or marriage of a producer of title business who is a
7 natural person; any director, officer or employee of a producer of title
8 business or associate; any legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
9 under common control with a producer of title business or associate; and
10 any natural person or legal entity with whom a producer of title business or
11 associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding or pursues any
12 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
13 of this section.
14 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
15 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
16 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
17 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
18 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
19 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
20 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
21 business.
22 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
23 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
24 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
25 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or
26 capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business,
27 occupation or profession of:
28 (A) Buying or selling interests in real property;
29 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
30 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
31 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
32 money with such interest as security.
33 (v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any
34 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
35 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
36 with respect to the referral.
37 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
38 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
39 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
40 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
41 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
42 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
43 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title

HB 2042 13
1 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
2 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
3 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
4 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
5 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
6 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
7 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
8 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
9 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The
10 prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall not apply to transactions
11 involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by
12 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
13 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
14 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent
15 shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which
16 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
17 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
18 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
19 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
20 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
21 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
22 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
23 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
24 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
25 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
26 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
27 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
28 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
29 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
30 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
31 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
32 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
33 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
34 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges
35 generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services. Such
36 disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated
37 to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate
38 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
39 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
40 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
41 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers
42 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed
43 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment

HB 2042 14
1 having been made to such title insurer or agent.
2 (2) No producer of title business or associate of such producer shall
3 require, directly or indirectly, as a condition to selling or furnishing any
4 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
5 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
6 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
7 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
8 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
9 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to
10 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
11 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
12 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
13 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
14 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
15 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
16 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
17 realized from such financial interest, so long as:
18 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
19 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
20 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
21 the referral of business; and
22 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
23 on the investment of the producer or associate.
24 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
25 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
26 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
27 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
28 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
29 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
30 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
31 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
32 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
33 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
34 to the premium for the title insurance.
35 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
36 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
37 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
38 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
39 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
40 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
41 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this
42 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of
43 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.

HB 2042 15
1 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide
2 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
3 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
4 to carry out the provisions of this act.
5 (15) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
6 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
7 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (public law
8 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
9 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent
10 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
11 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
12 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
13 information regulation".
14 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
15 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
16 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
17 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
18 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
19 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
20 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-1139 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-1137 and 40-2404
21 are hereby repealed.
22 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
23 publication in the statute book.
