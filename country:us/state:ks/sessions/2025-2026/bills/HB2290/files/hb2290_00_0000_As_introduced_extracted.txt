30 prior to the forfeiture held by an interest holder.
31 (1) No real property or conveyance, or an interest therein, may be
32 forfeited under this act unless the offense or conduct giving rise to
33 forfeiture constitutes a felony, except as provided in the Kansas land and
34 military installation protection act, section 1 et seq., and amendments
35 thereto.
36 (2) No conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the
37 transaction of business as a common carrier is subject to forfeiture under
38 this act unless the owner or other person in charge of the conveyance is a
39 consenting party or privy to a violation of this act.
40 (3) No property is subject to forfeiture under this act if the owner or
41 interest holder acquired the property before or during the conduct giving
42 rise to the property's forfeiture, and such owner or interest holder:
43 (A) Did not know and could not have reasonably known of the act or
HB 2290 9
1 omission or that it was likely to occur; or
2 (B) acted reasonably to prevent the conduct giving rise to forfeiture.
3 (4) No property is subject to forfeiture if the owner or interest holder
4 acquired the property after the conduct giving rise to the property's
5 forfeiture, including acquisition of proceeds of conduct giving rise to
6 forfeiture, and such owner or interest holder:
7 (A) Acquired the property in good faith, for value; and

13 unless before the interest was acquired the attorney knew of a judicial
14 determination of probable cause that the property is subject to forfeiture.
15 (B) The state bears the burden of proving that an exemption claimed
16 under this section is not applicable. Evidence made available by the
17 compelled disclosure of confidential communications between an attorney
18 and a client other than nonprivileged information relating to attorney fees,
19 is not admissible to satisfy the state's burden of proof.
20 (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), property is not exempt from
21 forfeiture, even though the owner or interest holder lacked knowledge or
22 reason to know that the conduct giving rise to property's forfeiture had
23 occurred or was likely to occur, if the:

25 authority to convey the property of the person claiming the exemption to a
26 good faith purchaser for value at the time of the conduct;

32 with reason to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this
33 act.
34 (c) Prior to final judgment in a judicial forfeiture proceeding, the
35 court shall determine whether the proposed forfeiture is unconstitutionally
36 excessive pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto, if the
37 court has not made such determination earlier in the proceeding as a result
38 of a petition filed pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto.
39 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 60-4104 and 60-4106 are hereby
40 repealed.
41 Sec. 13. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
42 publication in the statute book.

30 prior to the forfeiture held by an interest holder.
31 (1) No real property or conveyance, or an interest therein, may be
32 forfeited under this act unless the offense or conduct giving rise to
33 forfeiture constitutes a felony, except as provided in the Kansas land and
34 military installation protection act, section 1 et seq., and amendments
35 thereto.
36 (2) No conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the
37 transaction of business as a common carrier is subject to forfeiture under
38 this act unless the owner or other person in charge of the conveyance is a
39 consenting party or privy to a violation of this act.
40 (3) No property is subject to forfeiture under this act if the owner or
41 interest holder acquired the property before or during the conduct giving
42 rise to the property's forfeiture, and such owner or interest holder:
43 (A) Did not know and could not have reasonably known of the act or

HB 2290 9
1 omission or that it was likely to occur; or
2 (B) acted reasonably to prevent the conduct giving rise to forfeiture.
3 (4) No property is subject to forfeiture if the owner or interest holder
4 acquired the property after the conduct giving rise to the property's
5 forfeiture, including acquisition of proceeds of conduct giving rise to
6 forfeiture, and such owner or interest holder:
7 (A) Acquired the property in good faith, for value; and

13 unless before the interest was acquired the attorney knew of a judicial
14 determination of probable cause that the property is subject to forfeiture.
15 (B) The state bears the burden of proving that an exemption claimed
16 under this section is not applicable. Evidence made available by the
17 compelled disclosure of confidential communications between an attorney
18 and a client other than nonprivileged information relating to attorney fees,
19 is not admissible to satisfy the state's burden of proof.
20 (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), property is not exempt from
21 forfeiture, even though the owner or interest holder lacked knowledge or
22 reason to know that the conduct giving rise to property's forfeiture had
23 occurred or was likely to occur, if the:

25 authority to convey the property of the person claiming the exemption to a
26 good faith purchaser for value at the time of the conduct;
27 (2) owner or interest holder is criminally responsible for the conduct
28 giving rise to the property's forfeiture, whether or not there is a prosecution
29 or conviction; or

32 with reason to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this
33 act.
34 (c) Prior to final judgment in a judicial forfeiture proceeding, the
35 court shall determine whether the proposed forfeiture is unconstitutionally
36 excessive pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto, if the
37 court has not made such determination earlier in the proceeding as a result
38 of a petition filed pursuant to K.S.A. 60-4112(g), and amendments thereto.
39 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 60-4104 and 60-4106 are hereby
40 repealed.
41 Sec. 13. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
42 publication in the statute book.
