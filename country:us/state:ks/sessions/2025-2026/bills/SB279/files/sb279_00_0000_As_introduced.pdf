40 (1) Furnish forms prescribed and provided by the commission for
41 making reports and statements required to be filed in the office of the
42 secretary of state by the campaign finance act; and
43 (2) make such reports and statements available for public inspection

SB 279 14
1 and copying during regular office hours.
2 (b) The county election officer shall:
3 (1) Furnish forms prescribed and provided by the commission for
4 making reports and statements required to be filed in the office of the
5 county election officer by the campaign finance act; and
6 (2) make such reports and statements available for public inspection
7 and copying during regular office hours.
8 (c) The commission may investigate, or cause to be investigated, any
9 matter required to be reported upon by any person under the provisions of
10 the campaign finance act, or any matter to which the campaign finance act
11 applies irrespective of whether a complaint has been filed in relation
12 thereto.
13 (d) (1) After a preliminary investigation of any matter reported to the
14 commission pursuant to subsection (c), and upon specific written findings
15 of fact and conclusions of law by the commission that there is a reasonable
16 suspicion that a violation of the campaign finance act has occurred, the
17 commission or any officer designated by the commission may apply to the
18 district court of Shawnee county for an order to administer oaths and
19 affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence,
20 and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence,
21 memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the
22 commission deems relevant or material to the investigation. All
23 applications for a court order shall be made under seal of the court. The
24 commission shall reimburse the reasonable costs of production of
25 documents subject to subpoena. All subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum
26 issued under this section shall be authorized by the affirmative vote of not
27 less than 2/ of the members of the commission. Subpoenas duces tecum
3
28 shall be limited to items reasonably relevant to such alleged violations. No
29 subpoena or other process issued by the commission pursuant to this
30 section shall be served upon any person unless an application has been
31 filed in the district court of Shawnee county pursuant to this section.
32 (2) Upon application by the commission or any officer designated by
33 the commission for a court order pursuant to paragraph (1), the district
34 court of Shawnee county, after review of the sufficiency of the written
35 findings of fact and conclusions of law, the record before the commission
36 and the reasonableness and scope of the subpoena, shall issue to that
37 person an order requiring the person to appear before the commission or
38 any officer designated by the commission, there to produce documentary
39 evidence if so ordered or to give evidence touching the matter under
40 investigation or in question. Any failure to obey the order of the court may
41 be punished by the court as a contempt of court. Upon the filing of an
42 application for a court order pursuant to paragraph (1), the commission
43 shall provide a copy of the written findings of fact and conclusions of law

SB 279 15
1 relating to the alleged violation and persons under investigation along with
2 a copy of the issued subpoena and notices required by paragraph (5) to the
3 recipient of the subpoena.
4 (3) The commission shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing an
5 undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. Any person
6 subject to a subpoena shall be informed that such person may apply to the
7 district court for relief on the basis that responding to the subpoena will
8 cause an undue burden or expense. The district court on review of any
9 such application for relief, may impose an appropriate sanction on the
10 commission including an order requiring the commission to reimburse the
11 person for lost earnings and attorney fees.
12 (4) Any person subpoenaed to testify or produce documents under
13 this section shall be informed that the person has a right to be advised by
14 counsel and that the person may not be required to make any self-
15 incriminating statements. Upon a request by such person for counsel, no
16 further examination of the witness shall take place until counsel is present.
17 In the event that counsel of the witness' choice is not available, the person
18 shall be required to obtain other counsel within three days in order that the
19 examination may proceed. If such person is indigent and unable to obtain
20 the services of counsel, the judge shall appoint counsel to assist the person
21 who shall be compensated as counsel appointed for indigent defendants in
22 the district court. Counsel for any witness shall be present while the
23 witness is testifying and may interpose objections on behalf of the witness.
24 Counsel shall not be permitted to examine or cross-examine the client or
25 any other witness during the examination.
26 (5) Every subpoena issued by the commission pursuant to paragraph
27 (l) shall be accompanied by a notice containing the information required to
28 be provided under paragraphs (3) and (4) and the following statement:
29 "This subpoena is not enforceable unless a district court of competent
30 jurisdiction issues an order to enforce the subpoena. The recipient of this
31 subpoena has rights under law including those listed in K.S.A. 25-4158(d)
32 (3), and amendments thereto, and other laws to seek relief from complying
33 with this subpoena, as well as a right to be represented by counsel in this
34 matter pursuant to K.S.A. 25-4158(d)(4), and amendments thereto."
35 (e) Any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to this
36 section shall expire and be invalid six months from the date of issuance
37 unless an order to enforce such subpoena is issued by the Shawnee county
38 district court prior to the date of expiration. Any subpoena or subpoena
39 duces tecum issued by the commission prior to July 1, 2025, is hereby
40 declared invalid by law.
41 Sec. 10. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 25-4181 is hereby amended to read as
42 follows: 25-4181. (a) The commission, in addition to any other penalty
43 prescribed under the campaign finance act, may assess a civil fine, after

SB 279 16
1 proper notice and an opportunity to be heard, against any person for a
2 violation of the campaign finance act in an amount not to exceed $5,000
3 for the first violation, $10,000 for the second violation and $15,000 for the
4 third violation and for each subsequent violation. Except as otherwise
5 provided, the fine imposed by the commission in any one matter shall not
6 exceed an amount that is triple the applicable fine for a single violation in
7 such matter. In the event the respondent derived pecuniary gain from the
8 specific violations, then, in lieu of the above fine amounts, the fine
9 imposed may be fixed at an amount greater than that provided in this
10 section, but in no event shall such amount exceed double the pecuniary
11 gain derived from the violation by the respondent. Nothing in this section
12 shall prevent the imposition of a separate fine by a court in a criminal
13 proceeding. Whenever any civil fine or penalty is proposed to be assessed
14 against the treasurer of any candidate who is not also the candidate, such
15 notice shall be given to both the treasurer and the candidate prior to the
16 assessment of such fine or penalty. All fines assessed and collected under
17 this section shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with the
18 provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of
19 each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in
20 the state treasury to the credit of the state general fund.
21 (b) No individual who has failed to pay any civil penalty or civil fine
22 assessed, or failed to file any report required to be filed under the
23 campaign finance act, unless such penalty or fine has been waived or is
24 under appeal, shall be eligible to become a candidate for state office or
25 local office until such penalty or fine has been paid or such report has been
26 filed or both such penalty or fine has been paid and such report filed.
27 (c) The commission shall not order community service or any other
28 specific performance in lieu of a civil fine as part of a consent decree or
29 final order. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the commission from
30 requiring training regarding or compliance with any provision of this act as
31 part of a consent decree or final order.
32 (d)(c) The commission shall not enter into any agreement with any
33 person that legally binds the commission from enforcing any law against
34 that person in exchange for the person's cooperation with or assistance of
35 the commission in any matter unless such person has received immunity
36 from criminal prosecution in the same matter from a county or district
37 attorney or the attorney general pursuant to K.S.A. 22-3415, and
38 amendments thereto.
39 Sec. 11. K.S.A. 46-214a is hereby amended to read as follows: 46-
40 214a. K.S.A. 46-215 through 46-293 and K.S.A. 46-237a, and
41 amendments thereto, and section 2, and amendments thereto, shall be
42 known and may be cited as the state governmental ethics law.
43 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 46-254 is hereby amended to read as follows: 46-254.

SB 279 17
1 The commission upon its own initiative may, and shall issue an advisory
2 opinion upon the request of any individual person to which this act applies
3 shall, render an opinion in writing on questions concerning the
4 interpretation of provisions of this act. Such advisory opinions shall be
5 issued in writing and only upon the receipt of such request. Any person
6 who acts in accordance with the provisions of such an opinion, shall be
7 presumed to have complied with the provisions of this act. A copy of every
8 opinion rendered by the commission shall be filed with the secretary of
9 state, and any opinion so filed shall be open to public inspection. The
10 secretary of state shall publish all opinions rendered under this section
11 monthly and each such publication shall be cumulative. Copies of each
12 opinion shall be filed with the secretary of the senate and the chief clerk of
13 the house on the same date as the same are filed with the secretary of state.
14 The secretary of state shall cause adequate copies of all filings under this
15 section to be supplied to the state library.
16 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 25-4119a, 25-4119d, 25-4119g, 25-4142, 25-4148,
17 25-4148a, 25-4153b, 25-4156, 46-214a and 46-254 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp.
18 25-4143, 25-4158 and 25-4181 are hereby repealed.
