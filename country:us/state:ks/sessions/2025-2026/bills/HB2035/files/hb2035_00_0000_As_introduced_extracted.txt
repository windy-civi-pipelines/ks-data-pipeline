22 (b) Valuations shall be established for each parcel of real property at
23 its fair market value in money in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A.
24 79-503a, and amendments thereto.

28 under a degree of management reflecting median production levels in the
29 manner hereinafter provided. A classification system for all land devoted
30 to agricultural use shall be adopted by the director of property valuation
31 using criteria established by the United States department of agriculture
32 natural resources conservation service.
33 (A) For all taxable years commencing after December 31, 1989, all

14 of management reflecting median production levels. The director of
15 property valuation shall determine median production levels based on
16 information available from state and federal crop and livestock reporting
17 services, the natural resources conservation service, and any other sources
18 of data that the director considers appropriate.

24 determined by deducting expenses normally incurred by the landlord from
25 the share of the gross income normally received by the landlord. The net
26 rental income normally received by the landlord from pasture or rangeland
27 within each county or homogeneous region shall be used as the basis for
28 determining agricultural income from such land. The net rental income
29 from pasture and rangeland that is normally received by the landlord shall
30 be determined by deducting expenses normally incurred from the gross
31 income normally received by the landlord. Commodity prices, crop yields
32 and pasture and rangeland rental rates and expenses shall be based on an
33 average of the eight calendar years immediately preceding the calendar
34 year that immediately precedes the year of valuation. Net income for every
35 land class within each county or homogeneous region shall be capitalized
36 at a rate determined to be the sum of the contract rate of interest on new

38 five-year period that includes the five years immediately preceding the
39 calendar year which immediately precedes the year of valuation, plus a
