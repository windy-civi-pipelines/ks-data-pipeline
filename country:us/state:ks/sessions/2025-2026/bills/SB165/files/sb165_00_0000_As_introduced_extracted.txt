36 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 79-4001 is hereby amended to read as follows: 79-
37 4001. Any municipality, as the same is defined in K.S.A. 10-1101, is
38 hereby authorized to make an annual tax levy not to exceed two mills for

40 any general improvement which such municipality is authorized by law to
41 make, or, to be used to remodel, construct, reconstruct, furnish and equip
42 an addition or annex to any library being operated and maintained by such
43 municipality, and in the case of cities, counties and school districts, to pay
SB 165 10
1 a portion of the principal and interest on bonds issued by cities under the

6 electors of the municipality at any general election or at a special election
7 called for such purpose, except that if such municipality is a school district
8 then such question shall be submitted to the qualified electors of such
9 school district at the next general election. The question as stated on the
10 ballot shall show the nature of the improvement contemplated, the total
11 amount to be raised by taxes, and the period over which such levy is to be
12 made, which shall in no case exceed ten (10) years. If a majority of those

16 other levies authorized by law and none of the limitations of article 19 of

19 been approved and the fund created as provided for in this section in any
20 city, and thereafter, it becomes evident that the city will be unable to use
21 the fund for the specific purposes herein provided for because of urban

24 and is hereby authorized to use such fund so accumulated for the purposes
25 of purchasing and improving a library or sites, constructing, furnishing,
26 equipping, remodeling or making additions to library buildings, and may
27 continue to make the tax levy for the purposes hereinbefore specified for
28 the period provided, but not to exceed a total of ten (10) years in any case;
29 and said governing board is further authorized to use such funds derived
30 from tax levies to prepay rent under leases with a public building
31 commission as provided for under K.S.A. 12-1757 et seq., and acts
32 amendatory thereof.
33 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 25-2019, 72-1143, 72-53,113, 74-32,259 and 79-4001
34 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 10-120 and 72-5143 are hereby repealed.

36 publication in the statute book.

5 resolution submit the question of making such levy to the qualified
6 electors of the municipality at any general election or at a special election
7 called for such purpose, except that if such municipality is a school district
8 then such question shall be submitted to the qualified electors of such
9 school district at the next general election. The question as stated on the
10 ballot shall show the nature of the improvement contemplated, the total
11 amount to be raised by taxes, and the period over which such levy is to be
12 made, which shall in no case exceed ten (10) years. If a majority of those
13 voting on such proposition vote in favor thereof, the governing body shall
14 make said levy and create such fund, the principal and interest thereof to
15 be used for the purpose authorized. Such levy shall be in addition to all
16 other levies authorized by law and none of the limitations of article 19 of
17 chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, or acts amendatory thereof or
18 supplemental thereto, shall apply to such levy. Whenever tax levies have
19 been approved and the fund created as provided for in this section in any
20 city, and thereafter, it becomes evident that the city will be unable to use
21 the fund for the specific purposes herein provided for because of urban
22 renewal plans approved by the federal government providing for the
23 removal of the library building, the governing board of such city shall be
24 and is hereby authorized to use such fund so accumulated for the purposes
25 of purchasing and improving a library or sites, constructing, furnishing,
26 equipping, remodeling or making additions to library buildings, and may
27 continue to make the tax levy for the purposes hereinbefore specified for
28 the period provided, but not to exceed a total of ten (10) years in any case;
29 and said governing board is further authorized to use such funds derived
30 from tax levies to prepay rent under leases with a public building
31 commission as provided for under K.S.A. 12-1757 et seq., and acts
32 amendatory thereof.
33 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 25-2019, 72-1143, 72-53,113, 74-32,259 and 79-4001
34 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 10-120 and 72-5143 are hereby repealed.
35 Sec. 10. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
36 publication in the statute book.
