12 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
13 New Section 1. (a) (1) The governing body of any taxing jurisdiction
14 that approves any appropriation or budget that provides for funding by
15 property tax revenues in excess of the amount provided in subsection (b)
16 may have such appropriation or budget subject to a protest petition and a
17 reduction in the amount of property tax revenues allowed to be levied by
18 the taxing jurisdiction. A protest petition contesting the increase in
19 property tax revenues for the taxing jurisdiction may be submitted to the
20 county clerk within 30 days, or the next business day after if the 30th day
21 falls on a weekend or county holiday, following the date that the governing
22 body of a taxing jurisdiction certifies to the county clerk the amount of ad
23 valorem tax to be levied pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments
24 thereto. If a taxing jurisdiction fails to timely certify the amount of ad
25 valorem tax to be levied pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments
26 thereto, the taxing jurisdiction shall be limited to funding by property tax
27 revenues at the maximum amount provided in subsection (b).
28 (2) The county clerk shall notify the county treasurer of all taxing
29 jurisdictions that approve any appropriation or budget that provides for
30 funding by property tax revenues in excess of the amount provided in
31 subsection (b). The county treasurer's office shall post on its website, if
32 such website exists, and post in the county treasurer's office whether any
33 protest petitions are available for any taxing jurisdiction within the county.
34 The county treasurer shall also make available in the county treasurer's
35 office during business hours a copy of each protest petition with the

2 K.S.A. 25-3602, and amendments thereto, relating to the filing of petitions
3 at one time all in one group and the petition circulator and signature
4 requirements shall not apply to protest petitions maintained by a county
5 treasurer. In the event that a protest petition is signed by at least 10% of
6 the qualified voters of the votes cast for the office of secretary of state at
7 the last general election in such taxing jurisdiction, and is filed within 30
8 days with the county clerk of the county, the taxing jurisdiction shall be
9 limited to funding by property tax revenues at the maximum amount
10 provided in subsection (b). Upon the finding that a petition protesting the
11 increase in funding by property tax revenues was signed by less than the
12 required number of voters, the taxing jurisdiction shall proceed with the
13 increases in funding by property tax revenues. The provisions of this
14 subsection shall not apply in the event the transfer provided in section
15 2(b), and amendments thereto, is not provided.
16 (b) A taxing jurisdiction shall be limited in its budget to a total
17 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied in an amount that is equal to or less
18 than the total amount of ad valorem tax levied for the preceding tax year,
19 increased by an amount that is equal to or less than such ad valorem tax
20 when the following are included:
21 (1) An increase of not more than the amount of the annual percentage
22 of consumer price index for all urban consumers in the midwest region as
23 published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department
24 of labor multiplied by the total amount of ad valorem tax levied for the
25 preceding tax year; and
26 (2) increased property tax revenues that, in the current year, are
27 produced and attributable to the taxation of the construction of any new
28 structures or improvements or the remodeling or renovation of any
29 existing structures or improvements on real property, excluding any
30 ordinary maintenance or repair of any existing structures or improvements
31 on the property. The director of property valuation shall provide to the
32 state treasurer any information required under this paragraph.

34 Kansas or a school district.

36 stewardship of tax revenue and appropriations (ASTRA) fund. All moneys

40 (b) On July 15 of each year, or as soon thereafter as moneys are
41 available, $60,000,000 shall be transferred by the director of accounts and
42 reports from the state general fund to the acknowledging stewardship of

13 city contained therein, if eligible pursuant to subsection (d), shall receive a
14 proportion of such apportionment based on the ratio of the property taxes
15 levied of the county and the property taxes levied of any cities located
16 within the county. The state treasurer shall send notice to every county and
17 city by August 1 with the maximum amount of ad valorem tax to be levied
18 to qualify pursuant to section 1(b), and amendments thereto, and the
