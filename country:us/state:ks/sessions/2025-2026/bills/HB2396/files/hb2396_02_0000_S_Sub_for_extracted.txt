10 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
11 New Section 1. (a) (1) The governing body of any taxing jurisdiction
12 that approves any appropriation or budget that provides for funding by
13 property tax revenues in excess of the amount provided in subsection (b)
14 may have such appropriation or budget subject to a protest petition and a
15 reduction in the amount of property tax revenues allowed to be levied by
16 the taxing jurisdiction. A protest petition contesting the increase in
17 property tax revenues for the taxing jurisdiction may be submitted to the
18 county clerk within 30 days, or the next business day after if the 30th day
19 falls on a weekend or county holiday, following the date that the governing
20 body of a taxing jurisdiction certifies to the county clerk the amount of ad
21 valorem tax to be levied pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments
22 thereto. If a taxing jurisdiction fails to timely certify the amount of ad
23 valorem tax to be levied pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments
24 thereto, the taxing jurisdiction shall be limited to funding by property tax
25 revenues at the maximum amount provided in subsection (b).
26 (2) The county clerk shall notify the county treasurer of all taxing
27 jurisdictions that approve any appropriation or budget that provides for
28 funding by property tax revenues in excess of the amount provided in
29 subsection (b). The county treasurer's office shall post on the county
30 website and social media, if such website or social media exists, and post
31 in the county treasurer's office whether any protest petitions are available
32 for any taxing jurisdiction within the county. The county treasurer shall
33 also make available in the county treasurer's office during business hours a
34 copy of each protest petition with the signature page in order to obtain
35 signatures. The requirements set forth in K.S.A. 25-3602, and amendments
36 thereto, relating to the filing of petitions at one time all in one group and
HB 2396 2
1 the petition circulator and signature requirements shall not apply to protest
2 petitions maintained by a county treasurer. The director of accounts and
3 reports shall design, revise and publish on the website of the department of
4 administration a standard protest petition form pursuant to the provisions
5 of this section and K.S.A. 25-3602, and amendments thereto. In the event
6 that a protest petition is signed by at least 10% of the qualified voters of
7 the votes cast for the office of president of the United States at the last
8 general election in such taxing jurisdiction, and is filed within 30 days
9 with the county clerk of the county, the taxing jurisdiction shall be limited
10 to funding by property tax revenues at the maximum amount provided in
11 subsection (b). Upon the finding that a petition protesting the increase in
12 funding by property tax revenues was signed by less than the required
13 number of voters, the taxing jurisdiction shall proceed with the increases
14 in funding by property tax revenues.
15 (b) A taxing jurisdiction shall be limited in its budget to a total
16 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied in an amount that is equal to or less
17 than the total amount of ad valorem tax levied for the preceding tax year,
18 increased by an amount that is equal to or less than such ad valorem tax
19 when the following are included:
20 (1) An increase of not more than the amount of the annual percentage
21 of consumer price index for all urban consumers in the midwest region as
22 published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department
23 of labor or 3%, whichever is less, multiplied by the total amount of ad
24 valorem tax levied for the preceding tax year;
25 (2) increased property tax revenues that, in the current year, are
26 produced and attributable to the taxation of the construction of any new
27 structures or improvements or the remodeling or renovation of any
28 existing structures or improvements on real property, excluding any
29 ordinary maintenance or repair of any existing structures or improvements
30 on the property. The director of property valuation shall provide to the
31 state treasurer any information required under this paragraph; and
32 (3) increased property tax revenues that are dedicated to paying off a
33 bond issuance that was approved by a vote of the electors at an election
34 held on and after July 1, 2025.
35 (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the state of
36 Kansas or a school district.
37 (d) (1) The county clerk shall provide a protest petition notice to each
38 taxpayer with property in taxing jurisdictions that approve any
39 appropriation or budget that provides for funding by property tax revenues
40 in excess of the amount provided in subsection (b). The county clerk shall
41 transmit the notice to each taxpayer by mail directed to the taxpayer's last
42 known address or by electronic means if such taxpayer and county clerk
43 have consented in writing to service by electronic means. The notice shall

15 and
16 (E) a clear and conspicuous identification of the taxing jurisdictions
17 that approved any appropriation or budget that is subject to a protest
18 petition pursuant to this section.
19 (2) In the event that a county clerk incurred costs of printing and
20 postage that were not reimbursed pursuant to paragraph (3), such county
21 clerk may seek reimbursement from all taxing jurisdictions with an
22 appropriation or budget that is subject to a protest petition. Such costs shall
23 be shared proportionately by all such taxing jurisdictions that were
24 included on the same notice based on the total property tax levied by each
25 taxing jurisdiction. Payment of such costs shall be due to the county clerk
26 by December 31 of the year in which such costs were incurred.
27 (3) (A) For calendar years 2025 and 2026, if a county clerk has
28 printing or postage costs pursuant to paragraph (1), the county clerk shall
29 notify and provide documentation of such costs to the secretary of
30 revenue. The secretary of revenue shall certify the amount of moneys
31 attributable to such costs and transmit a copy of such certification to the
32 director of accounts and reports. Upon such receipt of such certification,
33 the director of accounts and reports shall transfer an amount of moneys
34 equal to such certified amount from the state general fund to the protest
35 petition notification costs fund of the department of revenue. The secretary
36 of revenue shall transmit a copy of each such certification to the director of
37 legislative research and the director of the budget.

42 pursuant to paragraph (1). All expenditures from such fund shall be made
43 in accordance with appropriations acts upon warrants of the director of
HB 2396 4
1 accounts and reports issued pursuant to vouchers approved by the
2 secretary of revenue or the secretary's designee.
3 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-1801 is hereby amended to read as
4 follows: 79-1801. (a) Except as provided by subsection (b), each year the
5 governing body of any city, the trustees of any township, the board of
6 education of any school district and the governing bodies of all other
7 taxing subdivisions shall certify, on or before August 25, to the proper
8 county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied. Thereupon, the
9 county clerk shall place the tax upon the tax roll of the county, in the
10 manner prescribed by law, and the tax shall be collected by the county
11 treasurer. The county treasurer shall distribute the proceeds of the taxes
12 levied by each taxing subdivision in the manner provided by K.S.A. 12-

17 the governing body of the city or county shall certify, on or before October
18 1, to the proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied. On
19 and after January 1, 2021 2025, if the governing body of a taxing

21 revenue neutral rate under K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2988, and amendments
22 thereto, or amend such governing body's budget pursuant to a successful
23 protest petition under section 1, and amendments thereto, the governing
24 body of the taxing subdivision shall certify, on or before October 1, to the
25 proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied.
26 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2988 is hereby amended to read as
27 follows: 79-2988. (a) On or before June 15 each year, the county clerk
28 shall calculate the revenue neutral rate for each taxing subdivision and
29 include such revenue neutral rate on the notice of the estimated assessed
30 valuation provided to each taxing subdivision for budget purposes, except
31 that for tax year 2024, the deadline shall be extended to July 1, 2024. The
32 director of accounts and reports shall modify the prescribed budget
33 information form to show the revenue neutral rate.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no tax rate in excess
35 of the revenue neutral rate shall be levied by the governing body of any

37 the governing body according to the following procedure:
38 (1) At least 10 days in advance of the public hearing, the governing
39 body shall publish notice of its proposed intent to exceed the revenue
40 neutral rate by publishing notice:

35 conjunction with the proposed budget hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 79-2929,
36 and amendments thereto, if the governing body otherwise complies with

20 complaint or such taxpayer's duly authorized representative may file a
21 complaint with the state board of tax appeals by filing a written complaint,
22 on a form prescribed by the board, that contains the facts that the
23 complaining party believes show that a governing body of a taxing
24 subdivision did not comply with the provisions of subsection (b) and that a
25 reduction or refund of taxes is appropriate. The complaining party shall
26 provide a copy of such complaint to the governing body of the taxing
27 subdivision making the levy that is the subject of the complaint.
28 Notwithstanding K.S.A. 74-2438a, and amendments thereto, no filing fee
29 shall be charged by the executive director of the state board of tax appeals
30 for a complaint filed pursuant to this paragraph. The governing body of the
31 taxing subdivision making the levy that is the subject of the complaint
32 shall be a party to the proceeding. Notice of any summary proceeding or
33 hearing shall be served upon such governing body, the county clerk, the
34 director of accounts and reports and the complaining party. It shall be the

36 demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, the validity of such levy.
37 If upon a summary proceeding or hearing, it shall be made to appear to the
38 satisfaction of the board that the governing body of the taxing subdivision
39 did not comply with subsection (b), the state board of tax appeals shall
40 order such governing body to refund to taxpayers the amount of property
41 taxes over collected or reduce the taxes levied, if uncollected. The
42 provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed as prohibiting any other
43 remedies available under the law.
HB 2396 8
1 (d) On and after January 1, 2022, in the event that the tax levied by a
2 school district pursuant to K.S.A. 72-5142, and amendments thereto,
3 increases the property tax revenue generated for the purpose of calculating
4 the revenue neutral rate from the previous tax year and such amount of
5 increase in revenue generated from such tax levied is the only reason that
6 the school district would exceed the total property tax revenue from the
7 prior year, the school district shall be deemed to not have exceeded the
8 revenue neutral rate in levying a tax rate in excess of the revenue neutral
9 rate to take into account the increase in revenue from only such tax levied.
10 (e) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if
11 the governing body of a taxing subdivision must conduct a public hearing
12 to approve exceeding the revenue neutral rate under this section, the
13 governing body of the taxing subdivision shall certify, on or before
14 October 1, to the proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be
15 levied.
16 (2) If a governing body of a taxing subdivision did not comply with
17 the provisions of subsection (b) and certifies to the county clerk an amount
18 of ad valorem tax to be levied that would result in a tax rate in excess of its
19 revenue neutral rate, the county clerk shall reduce the ad valorem tax to be
20 levied to the amount resulting from such taxing subdivision's revenue
21 neutral rate.
22 (f) As used in this section:
23 (1) "Taxing subdivision" means any political subdivision of the state
24 that levies an ad valorem tax on property.
25 (2) "Revenue neutral rate" means the tax rate for the current tax year
26 that would generate the same property tax revenue as levied the previous
27 tax year using the current tax year's total assessed valuation. To calculate
28 the revenue neutral rate, the county clerk shall divide the property tax
29 revenue for such taxing subdivision levied for the previous tax year by the
30 total of all taxable assessed valuation in such taxing subdivision for the
31 current tax year, and then multiply the quotient by 1,000 to express the rate
32 in mills. The revenue neutral rate shall be expressed to the third decimal
33 place.
34 (g) In the event that a county clerk incurred costs of printing and
35 postage that were not reimbursed pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2989,
36 and amendments thereto, such county clerk may seek reimbursement from
37 all taxing subdivisions required to send the notice. Such costs shall be
38 shared proportionately by all taxing subdivisions that were included on the
39 same notice based on the total property tax levied by each taxing
40 subdivision. Payment of such costs shall be due to the county clerk by
41 December 31.
42 (h) The department of administration or the director of accounts and
43 reports shall make copies of adopted budgets, budget certificates, other
HB 2396 9
1 budget documents and revenue neutral rate documents available to the
2 public on the department of administration's website on a permanently
3 accessible web page that may be accessed via a conspicuous link to that
4 web page placed on the front page of the department's website. The
5 department of administration or the director of accounts and reports shall
6 also make the following information for each tax year available on such
7 website:
8 (1) A list of taxing subdivisions by county;
9 (2) whether each taxing subdivision conducted a hearing to consider
10 exceeding its revenue neutral rate;
11 (3) the revenue neutral rate of each taxing subdivision;
12 (4) the tax rate resulting from the adopted budget of each taxing
13 subdivision; and
14 (5) the percent change between the revenue neutral rate and the tax
15 rate for each taxing subdivision.
16 (i) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, in the event any
17 governing body does not comply with the provisions of subsection (b)
18 because such governing body did not intend to exceed its revenue neutral
19 rate but the final taxable assessed valuation of such taxing subdivision
20 used to calculate the actual tax levy is less than the estimated assessed
21 valuation used to calculate the revenue neutral rate, such governing body
22 shall be permitted to levy a tax rate that generates the same amount of
23 property tax revenue as levied the previous year or less.
24 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-1801 and 79-2988 are hereby repealed.
25 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
26 publication in the statute book.

11 New Section 1. (a) (1) The governing body of any taxing jurisdiction
12 that approves any appropriation or budget that provides for funding by
13 property tax revenues in excess of the amount provided in subsection (b)
14 may have such appropriation or budget subject to a protest petition and a

7 the votes cast for the office of president of the United States at the last
8 general election in such taxing jurisdiction, and is filed within 30 days
9 with the county clerk of the county, the taxing jurisdiction shall be limited
10 to funding by property tax revenues at the maximum amount provided in

13 number of voters, the taxing jurisdiction shall proceed with the increases
14 in funding by property tax revenues.
15 (b) A taxing jurisdiction shall be limited in its budget to a total
16 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied in an amount that is equal to or less
17 than the total amount of ad valorem tax levied for the preceding tax year,
18 increased by an amount that is equal to or less than such ad valorem tax
19 when the following are included:
20 (1) An increase of not more than the amount of the annual percentage
21 of consumer price index for all urban consumers in the midwest region as

24 valorem tax levied for the preceding tax year;
25 (2) increased property tax revenues that, in the current year, are
26 produced and attributable to the taxation of the construction of any new
27 structures or improvements or the remodeling or renovation of any
28 existing structures or improvements on real property, excluding any
29 ordinary maintenance or repair of any existing structures or improvements
30 on the property. The director of property valuation shall provide to the
31 state treasurer any information required under this paragraph; and
32 (3) increased property tax revenues that are dedicated to paying off a
33 bond issuance that was approved by a vote of the electors at an election
34 held on and after July 1, 2025.
35 (c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the state of
36 Kansas or a school district.

42 known address or by electronic means if such taxpayer and county clerk
43 have consented in writing to service by electronic means. The notice shall

15 and
16 (E) a clear and conspicuous identification of the taxing jurisdictions
17 that approved any appropriation or budget that is subject to a protest
18 petition pursuant to this section.
19 (2) In the event that a county clerk incurred costs of printing and
20 postage that were not reimbursed pursuant to paragraph (3), such county
21 clerk may seek reimbursement from all taxing jurisdictions with an
22 appropriation or budget that is subject to a protest petition. Such costs shall
23 be shared proportionately by all such taxing jurisdictions that were
24 included on the same notice based on the total property tax levied by each
25 taxing jurisdiction. Payment of such costs shall be due to the county clerk
26 by December 31 of the year in which such costs were incurred.
27 (3) (A) For calendar years 2025 and 2026, if a county clerk has
28 printing or postage costs pursuant to paragraph (1), the county clerk shall
29 notify and provide documentation of such costs to the secretary of
30 revenue. The secretary of revenue shall certify the amount of moneys
31 attributable to such costs and transmit a copy of such certification to the
32 director of accounts and reports. Upon such receipt of such certification,
33 the director of accounts and reports shall transfer an amount of moneys
34 equal to such certified amount from the state general fund to the protest
35 petition notification costs fund of the department of revenue. The secretary
36 of revenue shall transmit a copy of each such certification to the director of
37 legislative research and the director of the budget.
38 (B) There is hereby established in the state treasury the protest
39 petition notification costs fund that shall be administered by the secretary

41 fund shall be for the purpose of paying county printing and postage costs
42 pursuant to paragraph (1). All expenditures from such fund shall be made
43 in accordance with appropriations acts upon warrants of the director of

HB 2396 4
1 accounts and reports issued pursuant to vouchers approved by the
2 secretary of revenue or the secretary's designee.
3 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-1801 is hereby amended to read as
4 follows: 79-1801. (a) Except as provided by subsection (b), each year the

6 education of any school district and the governing bodies of all other
7 taxing subdivisions shall certify, on or before August 25, to the proper
8 county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied. Thereupon, the
9 county clerk shall place the tax upon the tax roll of the county, in the
10 manner prescribed by law, and the tax shall be collected by the county
11 treasurer. The county treasurer shall distribute the proceeds of the taxes
12 levied by each taxing subdivision in the manner provided by K.S.A. 12-
13 1678a, and amendments thereto.
14 (b) Prior to January 1, 2021, if the governing body of a city or county
15 must conduct an election for an increase in property tax to fund any
16 appropriation or budget under K.S.A. 25-433a, and amendments thereto,
17 the governing body of the city or county shall certify, on or before October
18 1, to the proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied. On
19 and after January 1, 2021 2025, if the governing body of a taxing
20 subdivision must conduct a public hearing to approve exceeding the
21 revenue neutral rate under K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2988, and amendments
22 thereto, or amend such governing body's budget pursuant to a successful
23 protest petition under section 1, and amendments thereto, the governing
24 body of the taxing subdivision shall certify, on or before October 1, to the
25 proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be levied.
26 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2988 is hereby amended to read as
27 follows: 79-2988. (a) On or before June 15 each year, the county clerk
28 shall calculate the revenue neutral rate for each taxing subdivision and
29 include such revenue neutral rate on the notice of the estimated assessed
30 valuation provided to each taxing subdivision for budget purposes, except
31 that for tax year 2024, the deadline shall be extended to July 1, 2024. The
32 director of accounts and reports shall modify the prescribed budget
33 information form to show the revenue neutral rate.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no tax rate in excess
35 of the revenue neutral rate shall be levied by the governing body of any
36 taxing subdivision unless a resolution or ordinance has been approved by
37 the governing body according to the following procedure:
38 (1) At least 10 days in advance of the public hearing, the governing
39 body shall publish notice of its proposed intent to exceed the revenue
40 neutral rate by publishing notice:

11 hearing. Alternatively, the county clerk may transmit the notice to the
12 taxpayer by electronic means at least 10 days in advance of the public
13 hearing, if such taxpayer and county clerk have consented in writing to
14 service by electronic means. The county clerk is not required to send a
15 notice to a property owner of property that is exempt from ad valorem
16 taxation. The county clerk shall consolidate the required information for
17 all taxing subdivisions relevant to the taxpayer's property on one notice.
18 The notice shall be in a format prescribed by the director of accounts and
19 reports. The notice shall include, but not be limited to:

1 (F) the estimated amount of property tax for the current year of each
2 taxing subdivision on the taxpayer's property based on either: (i) The
3 revenue neutral rate for a taxing subdivision that does not intend to exceed
4 its revenue neutral rate; or (ii) the proposed tax rate provided by the taxing
5 subdivision, if the taxing subdivision notified the county clerk of its
6 proposed intent to exceed its revenue neutral rate, and such rate used in
7 the calculation, in a column titled: "[Current year] Maximum Proposed

23 The columns described in subparagraphs (D) through (G) shall include
24 a total of the amounts at the end of each column. Although the state of

31 The governing body shall provide interested taxpayers desiring to be heard
32 an opportunity to present oral testimony within reasonable time limits and

34 make public comment. The public hearing may be conducted in
35 conjunction with the proposed budget hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 79-2929,
36 and amendments thereto, if the governing body otherwise complies with
37 all requirements of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed
38 to prohibit additional public hearings that provide additional opportunities
39 to present testimony or public comment prior to the public hearing
40 required by this section.
41 (4) A majority vote of the governing body, by the adoption of a
42 resolution or ordinance to approve exceeding the revenue neutral rate,

14 published on the website of the department of administration.
15 (c) (1) Any governing body subject to the provisions of this section
16 that does not comply with subsection (b) shall refund to taxpayers any
17 property taxes over-collected based on the amount of the levy that was in

19 (2) Any taxpayer of the taxing subdivision that is the subject of the
20 complaint or such taxpayer's duly authorized representative may file a
21 complaint with the state board of tax appeals by filing a written complaint,
22 on a form prescribed by the board, that contains the facts that the
23 complaining party believes show that a governing body of a taxing
24 subdivision did not comply with the provisions of subsection (b) and that a
25 reduction or refund of taxes is appropriate. The complaining party shall
26 provide a copy of such complaint to the governing body of the taxing
27 subdivision making the levy that is the subject of the complaint.
28 Notwithstanding K.S.A. 74-2438a, and amendments thereto, no filing fee
29 shall be charged by the executive director of the state board of tax appeals
30 for a complaint filed pursuant to this paragraph. The governing body of the
31 taxing subdivision making the levy that is the subject of the complaint
32 shall be a party to the proceeding. Notice of any summary proceeding or
33 hearing shall be served upon such governing body, the county clerk, the
34 director of accounts and reports and the complaining party. It shall be the

36 demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, the validity of such levy.
37 If upon a summary proceeding or hearing, it shall be made to appear to the
38 satisfaction of the board that the governing body of the taxing subdivision
39 did not comply with subsection (b), the state board of tax appeals shall
40 order such governing body to refund to taxpayers the amount of property
41 taxes over collected or reduce the taxes levied, if uncollected. The
42 provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed as prohibiting any other
43 remedies available under the law.

HB 2396 8
1 (d) On and after January 1, 2022, in the event that the tax levied by a
2 school district pursuant to K.S.A. 72-5142, and amendments thereto,
3 increases the property tax revenue generated for the purpose of calculating
4 the revenue neutral rate from the previous tax year and such amount of
5 increase in revenue generated from such tax levied is the only reason that
6 the school district would exceed the total property tax revenue from the
7 prior year, the school district shall be deemed to not have exceeded the
8 revenue neutral rate in levying a tax rate in excess of the revenue neutral
9 rate to take into account the increase in revenue from only such tax levied.
10 (e) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if
11 the governing body of a taxing subdivision must conduct a public hearing
12 to approve exceeding the revenue neutral rate under this section, the
13 governing body of the taxing subdivision shall certify, on or before
14 October 1, to the proper county clerk the amount of ad valorem tax to be
15 levied.
16 (2) If a governing body of a taxing subdivision did not comply with
17 the provisions of subsection (b) and certifies to the county clerk an amount
18 of ad valorem tax to be levied that would result in a tax rate in excess of its
19 revenue neutral rate, the county clerk shall reduce the ad valorem tax to be
20 levied to the amount resulting from such taxing subdivision's revenue
21 neutral rate.
22 (f) As used in this section:
23 (1) "Taxing subdivision" means any political subdivision of the state
24 that levies an ad valorem tax on property.
25 (2) "Revenue neutral rate" means the tax rate for the current tax year
26 that would generate the same property tax revenue as levied the previous
27 tax year using the current tax year's total assessed valuation. To calculate
28 the revenue neutral rate, the county clerk shall divide the property tax
29 revenue for such taxing subdivision levied for the previous tax year by the
30 total of all taxable assessed valuation in such taxing subdivision for the
31 current tax year, and then multiply the quotient by 1,000 to express the rate
32 in mills. The revenue neutral rate shall be expressed to the third decimal
33 place.
34 (g) In the event that a county clerk incurred costs of printing and
35 postage that were not reimbursed pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-2989,
36 and amendments thereto, such county clerk may seek reimbursement from
37 all taxing subdivisions required to send the notice. Such costs shall be
38 shared proportionately by all taxing subdivisions that were included on the
39 same notice based on the total property tax levied by each taxing
40 subdivision. Payment of such costs shall be due to the county clerk by
41 December 31.
42 (h) The department of administration or the director of accounts and
43 reports shall make copies of adopted budgets, budget certificates, other

HB 2396 9
1 budget documents and revenue neutral rate documents available to the
2 public on the department of administration's website on a permanently
3 accessible web page that may be accessed via a conspicuous link to that
4 web page placed on the front page of the department's website. The
5 department of administration or the director of accounts and reports shall
6 also make the following information for each tax year available on such
7 website:
8 (1) A list of taxing subdivisions by county;
9 (2) whether each taxing subdivision conducted a hearing to consider
10 exceeding its revenue neutral rate;
11 (3) the revenue neutral rate of each taxing subdivision;
12 (4) the tax rate resulting from the adopted budget of each taxing
13 subdivision; and
14 (5) the percent change between the revenue neutral rate and the tax
15 rate for each taxing subdivision.
16 (i) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, in the event any
17 governing body does not comply with the provisions of subsection (b)
18 because such governing body did not intend to exceed its revenue neutral
19 rate but the final taxable assessed valuation of such taxing subdivision
20 used to calculate the actual tax levy is less than the estimated assessed
21 valuation used to calculate the revenue neutral rate, such governing body
22 shall be permitted to levy a tax rate that generates the same amount of
23 property tax revenue as levied the previous year or less.
24 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-1801 and 79-2988 are hereby repealed.
25 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
26 publication in the statute book.
