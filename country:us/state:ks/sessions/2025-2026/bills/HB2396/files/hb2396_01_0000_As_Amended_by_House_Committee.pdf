15 New Section 1. (a) (1) The governing body of any taxing jurisdiction
16 that approves any appropriation or budget that provides for funding by
17 property tax revenues in excess of the amount provided in subsection (b)
18 may have such appropriation or budget subject to a protest petition and a
19 reduction in the amount of property tax revenues allowed to be levied by
20 the taxing jurisdiction. A protest petition contesting the increase in
21 property tax revenues for the taxing jurisdiction may be submitted to the
22 county clerk within 30 days, or the next business day after if the 30th day
23 falls on a weekend or county holiday, following the date that the governing
24 body of a taxing jurisdiction certifies to the county clerk the amount of ad
25 valorem tax to be levied pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments
26 thereto. If a taxing jurisdiction fails to timely certify the amount of ad
27 valorem tax to be levied pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1801, and amendments
28 thereto, the taxing jurisdiction shall be limited to funding by property tax
29 revenues at the maximum amount provided in subsection (b).
30 (2) The county clerk shall notify the county treasurer of all taxing

2 also make available in the county treasurer's office during business hours a
3 copy of each protest petition with the signature page in order to obtain
4 signatures. The requirements set forth in K.S.A. 25-3602, and amendments
5 thereto, relating to the filing of petitions at one time all in one group and
6 the petition circulator and signature requirements shall not apply to protest
7 petitions maintained by a county treasurer. The director of accounts and
8 reports shall design, revise and publish on the website of the
9 department of administration a standard protest petition form
10 pursuant to the provisions of this section and K.S.A. 25-3602, and
11 amendments thereto. In the event that a protest petition is signed by at
12 least 10% of the qualified voters of the votes cast for the office of secretary
13 of state president of the United States at the last general election in such
14 taxing jurisdiction, and is filed within 30 days with the county clerk of the
15 county, the taxing jurisdiction shall be limited to funding by property tax
16 revenues at the maximum amount provided in subsection (b). Upon the
17 finding that a petition protesting the increase in funding by property tax
18 revenues was signed by less than the required number of voters, the taxing
19 jurisdiction shall proceed with the increases in funding by property tax
20 revenues. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply in the event the
21 transfer provided in section 2(b), and amendments thereto, is not provided.
22 (b) A taxing jurisdiction shall be limited in its budget to a total
23 amount of ad valorem tax to be levied in an amount that is equal to or less

31 preceding tax year; and
32 (2) increased property tax revenues that, in the current year, are
33 produced and attributable to the taxation of the construction of any new
34 structures or improvements or the remodeling or renovation of any
35 existing structures or improvements on real property, excluding any
36 ordinary maintenance or repair of any existing structures or improvements
37 on the property. The director of property valuation shall provide to the
38 state treasurer any information required under this paragraph; and
