27 minimum requirements:
28 (1) Be a United States citizen;

16 a mental or personality disorder that would adversely affect the ability to
17 perform the essential functions of a police officer or law enforcement
18 officer with reasonable skill, safety and judgment;

32 authority or agency head may request an order from the commission to
33 determine whether a provisional certification will be issued to that
34 applicant.

40 domestic violence or a misdemeanor offense that the commission
41 determines reflects on the honesty, trustworthiness, integrity or
42 competence of the applicant as defined by rules and regulations by the
43 commission and any diversion agreement or deferred judgment entered
HB 2164 3
1 into on or after July 1, 1995, for a felony.
2 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 74-5605 is hereby repealed.
