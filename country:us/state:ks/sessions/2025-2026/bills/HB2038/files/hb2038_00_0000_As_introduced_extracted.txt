29 company is a corporation having an election in effect under subchapter S
30 of the federal internal revenue code, a partnership or a limited liability
31 company, the credit shall be claimed by the shareholders of such
32 corporation, the partners of such partnership or members of such limited
33 liability company in the same manner as such shareholders, partners or
34 members account for their proportionate shares of the income or loss of

8 produce a project or contribute elements of a project for pay, the hired
9 company shall be considered a service provider for the hiring company,
10 and the hiring company shall be entitled to the income tax credit
11 authorized by this section.

15 transferees. The transferor shall provide notification and documentation of
16 the transfer or transfers with the transferor's claim for a tax credit pursuant

18 such form and manner and with all information as may be required by the
19 secretary of revenue, including, but not limited to, all information
20 requested regarding the transferee. The transferor shall make the transfer
21 within the calendar year in which the transferor's claim is made to the
22 secretary of revenue. The credit shall only be transferred once. The
23 transferor may transfer the credit to any individual or entity subject to
24 income tax under the Kansas income tax act. The transferred credit shall
25 be claimed by the transferee against the transferee's Kansas income tax
26 liability in the taxable year the credit was transferred. The amount of the
27 transferred credit that exceeds the transferee's tax liability for such year
28 may be carried over for deduction from the transferee's income tax liability
29 in the next succeeding taxable year or years until the total amount of the
30 tax credit has been deducted from the transferee's tax liability, except that
31 no such tax credit shall be carried over for deduction after the 10th taxable
32 year succeeding the taxable year in which the credit was transferred to the
33 transferee. The transferor or transferee shall provide such documentation
34 of the transfer to the secretary of revenue as may be required by the

10 thereof, the eligible not-for-profit corporation may recover the same from
11 the contractor together with reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or
12 any agent, employee or subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise
13 dispose of any materials purchased under such a certificate for any purpose
14 other than that for which such a certificate is issued without the payment

37 taxation not later than the 20th day of the month following the close of the
38 month in which a determination is made that such materials will not be

23 postproduction expenditures for a certified production approved by the
24 secretary of commerce as provided by section 3, and amendments thereto,
25 there shall be allowed an income tax credit against the tax imposed under
26 the Kansas income tax act based on the certified production company's
27 qualified expenditures as determined pursuant to subsection (d) and as
28 limited by subsection (h). The tax credit shall be applied against the
29 production company's income tax liability for the taxable year in which the
30 qualified expenditures are made by the production company. If the amount
31 of the tax credit allowed exceeds the production company's income tax
32 liability for the taxable year, the production company may carry over the
33 amount of the tax credit that exceeds such tax liability for deduction from
34 the production company's income tax liability in the next succeeding
35 taxable year or years until the total amount of the tax credit has been
36 deducted from the production company's tax liability, except that no such
37 tax credit shall be carried over for deduction after the 10th taxable year
38 succeeding the year in which the applicable qualified expenditures were
39 made by the production company. If the production company is a
40 corporation having an election in effect under subchapter S of the federal
41 internal revenue code, a partnership or a limited liability company, the
42 credit shall be claimed by the shareholders of such corporation, the
43 partners of such partnership or members of such limited liability company

5 tax credit may be transferred as provided by subsection (k).
6 (b) A claim for a tax credit shall be filed with the secretary of revenue
7 as part of a return filed by the production company pursuant to the Kansas
8 income tax act. The order that agreements are executed with the secretary
9 of commerce pursuant to section 3, and amendments thereto, shall
10 determine the order that tax credits are allocated by the secretary of
11 revenue. A claim shall be submitted with a return or amended return within
12 one calendar year of the date of the last eligible production expenditure or
13 the last eligible postproduction expenditure for the certified production
14 that would be eligible for an income tax credit as provided by subsection
15 (a). A request or requests by a production company for an extension of
16 time to submit a claim shall be granted by the secretary of revenue not to
17 exceed a total time extension of six months. All qualified production
18 expenditures or postproduction expenditures incurred during the taxable
19 year by a production company for a certified production shall be submitted
20 for credit as part of the same income tax return. A tax credit claim for
21 qualified expenditures during a taxable year shall not be divided and

13 production not intended for multimarket distribution but that otherwise
14 constitute qualified expenditures and meets all other qualifications for a

16 such qualified expenditures. The tax credit shall be applied against the
17 Kansas-based production company's income tax liability for the taxable
18 year in which the qualified expenditures are made by the Kansas-based
19 production company. If the amount of the tax credit exceeds the Kansas-
20 based production company's income tax liability, the Kansas-based
21 production company may carry over the amount of the tax credit that
22 exceeds such tax liability for deduction from the Kansas-based production
23 company's income tax liability in the next succeeding taxable year or years
24 until the total amount of the tax credit has been deducted from the Kansas-
25 based production company's tax liability, except that no such tax credit
26 shall be carried over for deduction after the 10th taxable year succeeding
27 the year in which the applicable qualified expenditures were made by the
28 Kansas-based production company. If the Kansas-based production
29 company is a corporation having an election in effect under subchapter S
30 of the federal internal revenue code, a partnership or a limited liability
31 company, the credit shall be claimed by the shareholders of such
32 corporation, the partners of such partnership or members of such limited
33 liability company in the same manner as such shareholders, partners or
34 members account for their proportionate shares of the income or loss of
35 the corporation, partnership or limited liability company and in accordance
36 with the agreement executed pursuant to section 3, and amendments
37 thereto. The tax credit may be transferred as provided by subsection (k).

2 for that certified project during that taxable year.
3 (i) For purposes of determining the payment of credit claims pursuant
4 to this section, the secretary of revenue may require that credit claims of
5 affiliates be combined into one claim if necessary to accurately reflect
6 closely integrated activities of affiliates.
7 (j) If a production company hires another production company to
8 produce a project or contribute elements of a project for pay, the hired
9 company shall be considered a service provider for the hiring company,
10 and the hiring company shall be entitled to the income tax credit
11 authorized by this section.
12 (k) A tax credit allowed pursuant to this section may be transferred, in
13 whole or in part, by the production company or, if applicable as provided
14 by subsection (a), a shareholder, partner or member, to one or more
15 transferees. The transferor shall provide notification and documentation of
16 the transfer or transfers with the transferor's claim for a tax credit pursuant

24 income tax under the Kansas income tax act. The transferred credit shall
25 be claimed by the transferee against the transferee's Kansas income tax
26 liability in the taxable year the credit was transferred. The amount of the
27 transferred credit that exceeds the transferee's tax liability for such year
28 may be carried over for deduction from the transferee's income tax liability
