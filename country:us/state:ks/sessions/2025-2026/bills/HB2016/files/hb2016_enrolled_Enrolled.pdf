United States and an active military member or the spouse or other
dependent of an active military member.

(c) "Active military member" means any person with full-time
duty status in the armed forces of the United States, including members

authorized by law to vote as a former precinct resident, an application
for an advance voting ballot. The signed application shall be
transmitted only to the county election officer by personal delivery,

(b) If the registered voter is applying for an advance voting ballot
to be transmitted in person, the voter shall provide identification

to be transmitted by mail, the voter shall provide with the application
for an advance voting ballot the voter's current and valid Kansas
driver's license number, nondriver's identification card number or a
photocopy of any other identification provided by K.S.A. 25-2908, and

(1) The voter is unable or refuses to provide current and valid
identification; or
(2) the name and address of the voter provided on the application
for an advance voting ballot do not match the voter's name and address
on the registration book. The voter shall provide a valid form of
identification as defined in K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto,
to the county election officer in person or provide a copy by mail or
electronic means before the meeting of the county board of canvassers.
At the meeting of the county board of canvassers the county election
officer shall present copies of identification received from provisional
voters and the corresponding provisional ballots. If the county board of
canvassers determines that a voter's identification is valid and the
provisional ballot was properly cast, the ballot shall be counted.
(e) No county election officer shall provide an advance voting

voter has a disability preventing the voter from signing. Signature
verification may occur by electronic device or by human inspection. In
the event that the signature of a person who is requesting an advance
voting ballot does not match that on file, the county election officer
shall attempt to contact the person and shall offer the person another
opportunity to provide the person's signature for the purposes of

advance voting ballot and a copy of identification provided by K.S.A.
25-2908, and amendments thereto, to the county election officer for
verification. If a person applies for an advance voting ballot to be
transmitted by mail but fails to provide identification pursuant to this
subsection or the identification of the person cannot be verified by the
county election officer, the county election officer shall provide
information to the person regarding the voter rights provisions of
subsection (d) and shall provide the person an opportunity to provide
identification pursuant to this subsection. For the purposes of this act,
Kansas state offices and offices of any subdivision of the state will
allow any person seeking to vote by an advance voting ballot the use of
a photocopying device to make one photocopy of an identification
document at no cost.
(f) (1) Applications for advance voting ballots to be transmitted to
