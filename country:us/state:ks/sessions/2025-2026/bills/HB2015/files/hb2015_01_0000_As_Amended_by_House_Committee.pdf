8 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
9 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 is hereby amended to read as
10 follows: 39-709. (a) General eligibility requirements for assistance for
11 which federal moneys are expended. Subject to the additional requirements
12 below, assistance in accordance with plans under which federal moneys
13 are expended may be granted to any needy person who:
14 (1) Has insufficient income or resources to provide a reasonable
15 subsistence compatible with decency and health. Where a husband and
16 wife or cohabiting partners are living together, the combined income or
17 resources of both shall be considered in determining the eligibility of
18 either or both for such assistance unless otherwise prohibited by law. The
19 secretary, in determining need of any applicant for or recipient of
20 assistance shall not take into account the financial responsibility of any
21 individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance unless such applicant
22 or recipient is such individual's spouse, cohabiting partner or such
23 individual's minor child or minor stepchild if the stepchild is living with
24 such individual. The secretary in determining need of an individual may
25 provide such income and resource exemptions as may be permitted by
26 federal law. For purposes of eligibility for temporary assistance for needy
27 families, for food assistance and for any other assistance provided through
28 the Kansas department for children and families under which federal
29 moneys are expended, the secretary for children and families shall
30 consider one motor vehicle owned by the applicant for assistance,
31 regardless of the value of such vehicle, as exempt personal property and
32 shall consider any equity in any boat, personal water craft, recreational
33 vehicle, recreational off-highway vehicle or all-terrain vehicle, as defined
34 by K.S.A. 8-126, and amendments thereto, or any additional motor vehicle
35 owned by the applicant for assistance to be a nonexempt resource of the

HB 2015—Am. by HC 2
1 applicant for assistance except that any additional motor vehicle used by
2 the applicant, the applicant's spouse or the applicant's cohabiting partner
3 for the primary purpose of earning income may be considered as exempt
4 personal property in the secretary's discretion; or
5 (2) is a citizen of the United States or is an alien lawfully admitted to
6 the United States and who is residing in the state of Kansas.
7 (b) Temporary assistance for needy families. Assistance may be
8 granted under this act to any dependent child, or relative, subject to the
9 general eligibility requirements as set out in subsection (a), who resides in
10 the state of Kansas or whose parent or other relative with whom the child
11 is living resides in the state of Kansas. Such assistance shall be known as
12 temporary assistance for needy families. Where the husband and wife or
13 cohabiting partners are living together, both shall register for work under
14 the program requirements for temporary assistance for needy families in
15 accordance with criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations
16 of the secretary.
17 (1) As used in this subsection, "family group" or "household" means
18 the applicant or recipient for TANF, child care subsidy or employment
19 services and all individuals living together in which there is a relationship
20 of legal responsibility or a qualifying caretaker relationship. This will
21 include a cohabiting boyfriend or girlfriend living with the person legally
22 responsible for the child. The family group shall not be eligible for TANF
23 if the family group contains at least one adult member who has received
24 TANF, including the federal TANF assistance received in any other state,
25 for 24 calendar months beginning on and after October 1, 1996, unless the
26 secretary determines a hardship exists and grants an extension allowing
27 receipt of TANF until the 36-month limit is reached. No extension beyond

32 child's behalf, the applicant, recipient or obligee is also deemed to have
33 appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact
34 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
35 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
36 payments received by the secretary in behalf of any person applying for,
37 receiving or having received such assistance. This limited power of
38 attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary approves the
39 application for aid and shall remain in effect until the assignment of
40 support rights has been terminated in full.
41 (e) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys or
42 state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted a
43 medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both are

HB 2015—Am. by HC 12
1 expended, medical assistance in accordance with such plan shall be
2 granted to any person who is a citizen of the United States or who is an
3 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
4 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
5 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
6 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
7 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
8 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
9 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
10 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to
11 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
12 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
13 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.
14 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
15 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint
16 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
17 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
18 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
19 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
20 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
21 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
22 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
23 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
24 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
25 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
26 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
27 of the legislature.
28 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
29 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
30 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
31 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
32 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
33 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
34 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
35 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
36 shall be considered an available resource unless:
37 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
38 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
39 (ii) the trust is funded:
40 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
41 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
42 or
43 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that

HB 2015—Am. by HC 13
1 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
2 assistance.
3 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
4 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
5 security act.
6 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
7 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
8 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
9 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
10 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,
11 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
12 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
13 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available
14 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
15 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed
16 prior to any services being provided;
17 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
18 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
19 nonlicensed individuals;
20 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
21 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
22 wage standards;
23 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
24 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
25 revenue agencies;
26 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
27 be paid after the services are rendered;
28 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
29 contract, agreement or accord; and
30 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
31 agreement or accord ceases.
32 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
33 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
34 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
35 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
36 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
37 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
38 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
39 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
40 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
41 Kansas uniform trust code.
42 (f) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
43 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-

HB 2015—Am. by HC 14
1 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
2 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
3 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
4 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
5 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
6 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
7 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
8 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
9 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
10 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the
11 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
12 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
13 outside the state voluntarily.
14 (g) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support and
15 limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased recipients. (1)
16 (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-787, and
17 amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after September
18 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare catastrophic coverage
19 act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for or receiving medical
20 assistance under a medical care plan in which federal funds are expended,
21 any accrued, present or future rights to support and any rights to payment
22 for medical care from a third party of an applicant or recipient and any
23 other family member for whom the applicant is applying shall be deemed
24 to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the state. The
25 assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date of approval
26 for such assistance without the requirement that any document be signed
27 by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving medical
28 assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
29 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact to perform the
30 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
31 or other negotiable instruments, representing payments received by the
32 secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
33 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
34 from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance and
35 shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full. The
36 assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third party
37 under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from directly
38 billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider has not
39 submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for payment.
40 Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to support
41 are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no other shall
42 be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments thereto,
43 except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be retained by

HB 2015—Am. by HC 15
1 the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
2 Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to payment for
3 medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the secretary for
4 repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
5 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
6 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
7 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
8 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
9 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
10 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes
11 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
12 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
13 under the provisions of subsection (e) is a claim against the property or
14 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
15 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,
16 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
17 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
18 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
19 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
20 individual under subsection (e) except after the death of the surviving
21 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
22 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
23 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
24 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
25 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
26 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
27 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e) is
28 a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
29 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
30 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
31 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
32 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
33 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
34 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
35 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
36 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
37 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
38 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
39 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
40 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery
41 program under this subsection.
42 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
43 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and

HB 2015—Am. by HC 16
1 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
2 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
3 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
4 the results therefrom:
5 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
6 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
7 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
8 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
9 defined by applicable law; and
10 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,
11 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
12 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
13 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance
14 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
15 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had
16 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
17 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
18 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
19 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
20 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
21 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
22 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
23 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
24 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
25 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
26 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
27 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
28 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
29 the county subject to the lien.
30 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
31 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
32 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
33 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
34 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
35 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
36 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
37 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
38 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
39 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
40 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall
41 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
42 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
43 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or

HB 2015—Am. by HC 17
1 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
2 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
3 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
4 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
5 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
6 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
7 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
8 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
9 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
10 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
11 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
12 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
13 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to
14 dissolution of the lien.
15 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the
16 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
17 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
18 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
19 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
20 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
21 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
22 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
23 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
24 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
25 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
26 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
27 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
28 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
29 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
30 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
31 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
32 following events occur:
33 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
34 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
35 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
36 environment or the secretary's designee;
37 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
38 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
39 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
40 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee
41 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
42 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
43 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed

HB 2015—Am. by HC 18
1 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
2 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
3 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
4 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
5 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
6 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
7 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
8 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
9 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
10 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's
11 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
12 designee.
13 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and
14 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
15 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of
16 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
17 nullified pursuant to law.
18 (h) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children or
19 revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
20 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
21 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
22 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
23 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
24 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
25 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
26 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
27 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
28 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
29 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
30 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
31 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
32 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
33 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
34 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
35 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
36 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
37 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
38 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
39 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
40 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
41 (i) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired from
42 employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and regulations
43 of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a felony

HB 2015—Am. by HC 19
1 conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or parole
2 imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
3 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
4 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
5 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
6 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
7 (j) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
8 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
9 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
10 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
11 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
12 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
13 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate
14 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
15 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
16 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
17 (k) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance,
18 the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned, pursuant to
19 K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on behalf of the
20 state only accrued, present or future rights to support from any other
21 person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of
22 any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or
23 receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically become
24 effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid without the
25 requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or recipient. By
26 applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance, the
27 applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
28 secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
29 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
30 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
31 secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
32 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
33 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
34 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
35 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
36 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
37 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
38 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
39 (l) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash assistance
40 as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons receiving cash
41 assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash assistance shall be
42 established, subject to applicable federal law, by the secretary for children
43 and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under such program of drug

HB 2015—Am. by HC 20
1 screening, the secretary for children and families shall order a drug
2 screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash assistance at any time
3 when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant for or recipient of
4 cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled
5 substance analog. The secretary for children and families may use any
6 information obtained by the secretary for children and families to
7 determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not
8 limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed appointments and
9 arrest or other police records, previous employment or application for
10 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug
11 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a
12 controlled substance or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening
13 records of the applicant or recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled
14 substance or controlled substance analog.
15 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
16 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
17 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
18 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
19 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
20 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
21 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
22 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
23 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
24 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
25 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
26 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
27 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
28 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
29 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
30 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
31 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
32 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
33 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
34 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
35 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
36 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
37 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
38 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
39 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
40 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills
41 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
42 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
43 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third

HB 2015—Am. by HC 21
1 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
2 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
3 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
4 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
5 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
6 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
7 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
8 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
9 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
10 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual
11 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
12 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
13 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for
14 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
15 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or
16 controlled substance analog.
17 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
18 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
19 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
20 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
21 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
22 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
23 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
24 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
25 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
26 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
27 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
28 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
29 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
30 controlled substance analog.
31 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
32 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
33 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
34 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
35 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
36 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
37 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
38 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
39 of such additional drug screening.
40 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
41 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
42 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
43 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for

HB 2015—Am. by HC 22
1 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
2 or legal guardian's minor child.
3 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
4 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
5 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
