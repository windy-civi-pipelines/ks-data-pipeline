7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 22-2502 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
9 2502. (a) A search warrant shall be issued only upon the oral or written
10 statement, including those conveyed or received by electronic
11 communication, of any person a law enforcement officer under oath or
12 affirmation which that states facts sufficient to show probable cause that a
13 crime has been, is being or is about to be committed and which
14 particularly describes a person, place or means of conveyance to be
15 searched and things to be seized. Any statement which that is made orally
16 shall be either taken down by a certified shorthand reporter, sworn to under
17 oath and made part of the application for a search warrant, or recorded
18 before the magistrate from whom the search warrant is requested and
19 sworn to under oath. Any statement orally made shall be reduced to
20 writing as soon thereafter as possible. If the magistrate is satisfied that
21 grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe
22 that they exist, the magistrate may issue a search warrant for:
23 (1) The search or seizure of the following:
24 (A) Anything that can be seized under the fourth amendment of the
25 United States constitution;
26 (B) anything which that has been used in the commission of a crime,
27 or any contraband or any property which that constitutes or may be
28 considered a part of the evidence, fruits or instrumentalities of a crime
29 under the laws of this state, any other state or of the United States. The
30 term "fruits" as used in this act shall be interpreted to include any property
31 into which the thing or things unlawfully taken or possessed may have
32 been converted;
33 (C) any person who has been kidnapped in violation of the laws of
34 this state or who has been kidnapped in another jurisdiction and is now

3 (F) any person for whom a valid felony arrest warrant has been issued
4 in this state or in another jurisdiction; or
5 (G) (i) any information concerning the user of an electronic
6 communication service;, any information concerning the location of
7 electronic communications systems, including, but not limited to, towers
8 transmitting cellular signals involved in any wire communication;, and any
9 other information made through an electronic communications system; or
10 (ii) the jurisdiction granted in this paragraph shall extend to
11 information held by entities registered to do business in the state of
12 Kansas, submitting to the jurisdiction thereof, and entities primarily
13 located outside the state of Kansas if the jurisdiction in which the entity is
14 primarily located recognizes the authority of the magistrate to issue the
15 search warrant; or
16 (2) the installation, maintenance and use of a tracking device.
17 (b) (1) The search warrant under subsection (a)(2) shall authorize the
18 installation and use of the tracking device to track and collect tracking data
19 relating to a person or property for a specified period of time, not to
20 exceed 30 days from the date of the installation of the device.
21 (2) The search warrant under subsection (a)(2) may authorize the
22 retrieval of the tracking data recorded by the tracking device during the
23 specified period of time for authorized use of such tracking device within a
24 reasonable time after the expiration of such warrant, for good cause
25 shown.
26 (3) The magistrate may, for good cause shown, grant one or more
27 extensions of a search warrant under subsection (a)(2) for the use of a
28 tracking device, not to exceed 30 days each.
29 (c) Before ruling on a request for a search warrant, the magistrate
30 may require the affiant to appear personally and may examine under oath
31 the affiant and any witnesses that the affiant may produce. Such
32 proceeding shall be taken down by a certified shorthand reporter or
33 recording equipment and made part of the application for a search warrant.
34 (d) For a warrant executed prior to July 1, 2014, affidavits or sworn
35 testimony in support of the probable cause requirement of this section or
36 search warrants for tracking devices shall not be made available for
37 examination without a written order of the court, except that such
38 affidavits or testimony when requested shall be made available to the
39 defendant or the defendant's counsel for such disposition as either may
40 desire.
41 (e) (1) For a warrant executed on or after July 1, 2014, affidavits or
42 sworn testimony in support of the probable cause requirement of this
43 section or search warrants for tracking devices shall not be open to the
SB 138 3
1 public until the warrant has been executed. After the warrant has been
2 executed, such affidavits or sworn testimony shall be made available to:
3 (A) The defendant or the defendant's counsel, when requested, for
4 such disposition as either may desire; and
5 (B) any person, when requested, in accordance with the requirements
6 of this subsection.
7 (2) Any person may request that affidavits or sworn testimony be
8 disclosed by filing such request with the clerk of the court. The clerk of the
9 court shall promptly notify the defendant or the defendant's counsel, the
10 prosecutor and the magistrate that such request was filed. The prosecutor
11 shall promptly notify any victim.
12 (3) Within five business days after receiving notice of a request for
13 disclosure from the clerk of the court, the defendant or the defendant's
14 counsel and the prosecutor may submit to the magistrate, under seal,
15 either:
16 (A) Proposed redactions, if any, to the affidavits or sworn testimony
17 and the reasons supporting such proposed redactions; or
18 (B) a motion to seal the affidavits or sworn testimony and the reasons
19 supporting such proposed seal.
20 (4) The magistrate shall review the requested affidavits or sworn
21 testimony and any proposed redactions or motion to seal submitted by the
22 defendant, the defendant's counsel or the prosecutor. The magistrate shall
23 make appropriate redactions, or seal the affidavits or sworn testimony, as
24 necessary to prevent public disclosure of information that would:
25 (A) Jeopardize the physical, mental or emotional safety or well-being
26 of a victim, witness, confidential source or undercover agent, or cause the
27 destruction of evidence;
28 (B) reveal information obtained from a court-ordered wiretap or from
29 a search warrant for a tracking device that has not expired;
30 (C) interfere with any prospective law enforcement action, criminal
31 investigation or prosecution;
32 (D) reveal the identity of any confidential source or undercover agent;
33 (E) reveal confidential investigative techniques or procedures not
34 known to the general public;
35 (F) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;
36 (G) reveal the name, address, telephone number or any other
37 information which specifically and individually identifies the victim of any
38 sexual offense described in article 35 of chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes
39 Annotated, prior to their repeal, or article 55 of chapter 21 of the Kansas
40 Statutes Annotated or K.S.A. 21-6419 through 21-6422, and amendments
41 thereto;
42 (H) reveal the name of any minor;
43 (I) reveal any date of birth, personal or business telephone number,
SB 138 4
1 driver's license number, nondriver's identification number, social security
2 number, employee identification number, taxpayer identification number,
3 vehicle identification number or financial account information; or
4 (J) constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. As
5 used in this subparagraph, "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
6 privacy" means revealing information that would be highly offensive to a
7 reasonable person and is totally unrelated to the alleged crime that resulted
8 in the issuance of the search warrant, including information totally
9 unrelated to the alleged crime that may pose a risk to a person or property
10 and is not of legitimate concern to the public. The provisions of this
11 subparagraph shall only be used to redact and shall not be used to seal
12 affidavits or sworn testimony.
13 (5) Within five business days after receiving proposed redactions or a
14 motion to seal from the defendant, the defendant's counsel or the
15 prosecutor, or within 10 business days after receiving notice of a request
16 for disclosure, whichever is earlier, the magistrate shall either:
17 (A) Order disclosure of the affidavits or sworn testimony with
18 appropriate redactions, if any; or
19 (B) order the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed and not subject to
20 public disclosure.
21 (6) (A) If the magistrate orders disclosure of the affidavits or sworn
22 testimony with appropriate redactions, if any, to any person in accordance
23 with the requirements of this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn
24 testimony shall become part of the court record and shall be accessible to
25 the public.
26 (B) If the magistrate orders the affidavits or sworn testimony sealed
27 and not subject to public disclosure in accordance with the requirements of
28 this subsection, then such affidavits or sworn testimony shall become part
29 of the court record that is not accessible to the public.
30 (C) Any request for disclosure of affidavits or sworn testimony in
31 accordance with the requirements of this subsection shall become part of
32 the court record and shall be accessible to the public, regardless of whether
33 the magistrate orders disclosure with appropriate redactions, if any, or
34 sealing of the requested affidavit or sworn testimony.
35 (f) As used in this section:
36 (1) "Electronic communication" means the use of electronic
37 equipment to send or transfer a copy of an original document;
38 (2) "electronic communication service" and "electronic
39 communication system" have the meaning as defined in K.S.A. 22-2514,
40 and amendments thereto;
41 (3) "tracking data" means information gathered or recorded by a
42 tracking device;
43 (4) "tracking device" means an electronic or mechanical device that
SB 138 5
1 permits a person to remotely determine or track the position or movement
2 of a person or object. "Tracking device" includes, but is not limited to, a
3 device that stores geographic data for subsequent access or analysis and a
4 device that allows for the real-time monitoring of movement; and
5 (5) "victim" shall include any victim of an alleged crime that resulted
6 in the issuance of the search warrant, or, if the victim is deceased, the
7 victim's family, as defined in K.S.A. 74-7335, and amendments thereto.
8 (g) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a search
9 warrant for cellular location information in an emergency situation
10 pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4615, and amendments thereto.
11 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-2502 is hereby repealed.
12 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
13 publication in the statute book.
