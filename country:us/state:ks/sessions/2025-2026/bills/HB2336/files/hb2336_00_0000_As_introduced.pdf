13 New Section 1. (a) Commencing with fiscal year 2026, the director of
14 the budget, in consultation with the director of legislative research, shall
15 certify, at the end of each such fiscal year, the amount of actual corporate
16 income tax receipt revenues generated pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c),
17 and amendments thereto, that is in excess of the prior fiscal year's
18 corporate income tax receipts. The director of the budget shall transmit
19 such certification to the secretary of revenue. Upon receipt of such
20 certification, the secretary shall compute the reduction of the corporate
21 income tax rate pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto.
22 The certified amount shall be computed in dollars by the secretary for a
23 reduction rounded down to the nearest 0.1% in the corporate income tax
24 rate, if any, to go into effect for the next calendar year that would reduce
25 the corporate income tax rate in an amount approximately equal to the
26 amount computed by the secretary. The secretary shall reduce the normal
27 tax on corporations. Such rate reductions shall remain in effect unless
28 further reduced pursuant to law.
29 (b) The secretary shall publish by October 1, 2027, the new income
30 tax rates to take effect on January 1, 2028.
31 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 79-1129 is hereby amended to read as follows: 79-
32 1129. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, a financial institution
33 whose business activity is taxable both within and without this state shall
34 allocate and apportion its net income as provided in this act. All items of
35 nonbusiness income, income which is not includable in the apportionable

HB 2336 2
1 income tax base, shall be allocated pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A.
2 79-3274 through 79-3278 and amendments thereto. A financial institution
3 organized under the laws of a foreign country, the commonwealth of
4 Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States whose
5 effectively connected income, as defined under the federal internal revenue
6 code, is taxable both within this state and within another state, other than
7 the state in which it is organized, shall allocate and apportion its net
8 income as provided in this act and its apportionment factors shall include
9 the part of its property, payroll and receipts that is related to its
10 apportionable income.
11 (b) (1) For taxable years prior to January 1, 2028, all business
12 income shall be apportioned as follows:
13 (A) All business income, income which is includable in the
14 apportionable income tax base, shall be apportioned to this state by
15 multiplying such income by the apportionment percentage. The
16 apportionment percentage is determined by adding the taxpayer's receipts
17 factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1130, and amendments thereto, property
18 factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1131, and amendments thereto, and
19 payroll factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1132, and amendments thereto,
20 together and dividing the sum by three. If one of the factors is missing, the
21 two remaining factors are added and the sum is divided by two. If two of
22 the factors are missing, the remaining factor is the apportionment
23 percentage. A factor is missing if both its numerator and denominator are
24 zero, but it is not missing merely because its numerator is zero.
25 (B) (i) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2025, and
26 ending before January 1, 2028, at the election of the taxpayer, all business
27 income that is includable in the apportionable income tax base, may be
28 apportioned to this state by the taxpayer's receipts factor, as described in
29 K.S.A. 79-1130, and amendments thereto.
30 (ii) An election under this subparagraph shall be made by including
31 a statement with the original tax return for which the election is made
32 indicating that the taxpayer elects to apply this apportionment method.
33 The election shall be effective and irrevocable for the taxable year of the
34 election and shall be binding on all members of a unitary group of
35 corporations.
36 (2) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2028, all
37 business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the
38 business income by the receipts factor.
39 (c) Each factor shall be computed according to the method of
40 accounting, cash or accrual basis, used by the taxpayer for the taxable year.
41 (d) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this act do not
42 fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state,
43 the taxpayer may petition for or the secretary of revenue may require, in

HB 2336 3
1 respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:
2 (1) Separate accounting;
3 (2) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
4 (3) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
5 represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or
6 (4) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
7 allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.
8 (e) In the event a combined report is utilized to determine the Kansas
9 income attributable to a unitary group of financial institutions, the
10 financial institutions in the combined group shall include only those
11 institutions which have a branch or office in Kansas.
12 (f) (1) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed in
13 accordance with this subsection.
14 (2) As of July 1, 2025, only publicly traded companies, including
15 affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded
16 company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
17 accepted accounting principles, shall be eligible for this deduction.
18 (3) If the provisions of this section result in an aggregate increase in
19 the taxpayer's net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease in the
20 taxpayer's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
21 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the taxpayer shall be
22 entitled to a deduction, as determined in this subsection. For the purposes
23 of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes a unitary group of businesses
24 that is required to file a combined report. The deferred tax impact
25 deduction provided under this section for a unitary group of businesses
26 that is required to file a combined report shall be calculated using unitary
27 net deferred tax assets and liabilities and deducted against unitary group
28 income.
29 (4) A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deferred tax impact deduction
30 from the taxpayer's net business income before apportionment equal to the
31 amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or
32 decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net
33 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. Such increase in the net
34 deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the
35 aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax
36 liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the
37 imposition of the single sales factor requirements pursuant to this section,
38 excluding the deduction provided under this paragraph, as of the end of
39 the tax year prior to the year in which the taxpayer makes an election or is
40 required to apportion by the sales factor. The amount of the deduction
41 shall equal the annual deferred tax deduction amount set forth in
42 paragraph (5).
43 (5) The annual deferred tax deduction amount shall be calculated as

HB 2336 4
1 follows:
2 (A) The deferred tax impact determined in paragraph (4) shall be
3 divided by the income tax rate for corporations in effect for the tax year
4 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110, and amendments thereto;
5 (B) the resulting amount shall be further divided by the Kansas
6 apportionment factor that was used by the taxpayer in the calculation of
7 the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as provided in this
8 subsection; and
9 (C) the result multiplied by 1/ shall represent the total net deferred
10
10 tax deduction available for the first tax year beginning on or after January
11 1, 2035, and the next nine successive tax years.
12 (6) The deduction calculated under paragraph (5) shall not be
13 adjusted as a result of any events subsequent to such calculation,
14 including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets.
15 Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to any tax liabilities
16 under the federal internal revenue code and shall not alter the tax basis of
17 any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the taxpayer's
18 net business income before apportionment, any excess deduction shall be
19 carried forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully
20 utilized.
21 (7) At the discretion of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed to
22 claim other available tax credits before claiming the deferred tax
23 deduction calculated under this section. Any deferred tax deduction
24 calculated under this section not claimed on a return shall be carried
25 forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully utilized.
26 (8) Any taxpayer intending to claim a deduction under this subsection
27 shall file a statement with the secretary on or before July 1, 2028,
28 specifying the total amount of the deduction that the taxpayer claims. The
29 statement shall be made on such form and in such manner as prescribed
30 by the secretary and shall contain such information or calculations as the
31 secretary may specify. No deduction shall be allowed under this section
32 for any taxable year except to the extent claimed in the manner prescribed
33 on or before July 1, 2028.

15 of wage thresholds shall be determined by the secretary of commerce; and
16 (vii) alternatively, a taxpayer may wage-qualify its new Kansas
17 business facility if, after excluding the headcount and wages reported on
18 the quarterly wage reports to the Kansas department of labor for
19 employees at that new Kansas business facility who own five percent or
20 more equity in the taxpayer, the average wage calculated for the taxpayer's
21 new Kansas business facility is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the
22 aggregate state-wide average wage paid by industries covered by the
23 employment security law based on data maintained by the secretary of
24 labor.
25 (B) For the purposes of the wage requirements in paragraph (A), the
26 number of full-time equivalent employees shall be determined by dividing
27 the number of hours worked by part-time employees during the pertinent
28 measurement interval by an amount equal to the corresponding multiple of
29 a 40-hour work week and adding the quotient to the average number of
30 full-time employees.
31 (C) When the qualifying taxpayer is part of a unitary group, the
32 business income of the unitary group attributable to the qualifying
33 taxpayer shall be determined by multiplying the business income of the
34 unitary group by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor
35 plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which
36 is three. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
37 average value of the qualifying taxpayer's real and tangible personal
38 property owned or rented and used during the tax period and the
39 denominator of which is the average value of the unitary group's real and
40 tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.
41 The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount
42 paid during the tax period by the qualifying taxpayer for compensation,
43 and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid by the unitary

HB 2336 12
1 group during the tax period. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
2 which is the total sales of the qualifying taxpayer during the tax period,
3 and the denominator of which is the total sales of the unitary group during
4 the tax period.
5 (D) For purposes of this subsection, the secretary of revenue, upon a
6 showing of good cause and after receiving a certification by the secretary
7 of commerce of substantial compliance with provisions of this subsection
8 (b)(6) (a)(6), may extend any required performance date provided in this
9 subsection (b)(6) (a)(6) for a period not to exceed six months.
10 (b) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2025, and
11 before January 1, 2028, at the election of the taxpayer, all business income
12 of any other taxpayer may be apportioned to this state by multiplying such
13 taxpayer's business income by the sales factor. An election under this
14 subsection shall be made by including a statement with the original tax
15 return for which the election is made indicating that the taxpayer elects to
16 apply this apportionment method. The election shall be effective and
17 irrevocable for the taxable year of the election.
18 (c) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2028, all
19 business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the
20 business income by the sales factor.
21 (d) Any taxpayer having previously made an election pursuant to
22 subsection (a)(2) shall be permitted to make a new election pursuant to
23 subsection (b).
24 (e) (1) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed in
25 accordance with this subsection.
26 (2) As of July 1, 2025, only publicly traded companies, including
27 affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded
28 company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
29 accepted accounting principles, shall be eligible for this deduction.
30 (3) If the provisions of this section result in an aggregate increase in
31 the taxpayer's net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease in the
32 taxpayer's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
33 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the taxpayer shall be
34 entitled to a deduction, as determined in this subsection. For the purposes
35 of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes a unitary group of businesses
36 that is required to file a combined report. The deferred tax impact
37 deduction provided under this section for a unitary group of businesses
38 that is required to file a combined report shall be calculated using unitary
39 net deferred tax assets and liabilities and deducted against unitary group
40 income.
41 (4) A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deferred tax impact deduction
42 from the taxpayer's net business income before apportionment equal to the
43 amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or

HB 2336 13
1 decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net
2 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. Such increase in the net
3 deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the
4 aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax
5 liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the
6 imposition of the single sales factor requirements pursuant to this section,
7 excluding the deduction provided under this paragraph, as of the end of
8 the tax year prior to the year in which the taxpayer makes an election or is
9 required to apportion by the sales factor. The amount of the deduction
10 shall equal the annual deferred tax deduction amount set forth in
11 paragraph (5).
12 (5) The annual deferred tax deduction amount shall be calculated as
13 follows:
14 (A) The deferred tax impact determined in paragraph (4) shall be
15 divided by the income tax rate for corporations in effect for the tax year
16 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110, and amendments thereto;
17 (B) the resulting amount shall be further divided by the Kansas
18 apportionment factor that was used by the taxpayer in the calculation of
19 the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as provided in this
20 subsection; and
21 (C) the result multiplied by 1/ shall represent the total net deferred
10
22 tax deduction available for the first tax year beginning on or after January
23 1, 2035, and the next nine successive tax years.
24 (6) The deduction calculated under paragraph (5) shall not be
25 adjusted as a result of any events subsequent to such calculation,
26 including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets.
27 Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to any tax liabilities
28 under the federal internal revenue code and shall not alter the tax basis of
29 any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the taxpayer's
30 net business income before apportionment, any excess deduction shall be
31 carried forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully
32 utilized.
33 (7) At the discretion of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed to
34 claim other available tax credits before claiming the deferred tax
35 deduction calculated under this section. Any deferred tax deduction
36 calculated under this section not claimed on a return shall be carried
37 forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully utilized.
38 (8) Any taxpayer intending to claim a deduction under this subsection
39 shall file a statement with the secretary on or before July 1, 2028,
40 specifying the total amount of the deduction that the taxpayer claims on
41 such form and in such manner as prescribed by the secretary and shall
42 contain such information or calculations as the secretary may specify. No
43 deduction shall be allowed under this section for any taxable year except

HB 2336 14
1 to the extent claimed in the manner prescribed on or before July 1, 2028.
2 (9) For purposes of this subsection:
3 (A) "Net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that
4 exceed the deferred tax assets of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance
5 with generally accepted accounting principles.
6 (B) "Net deferred tax asset" means that deferred tax assets exceed the
7 deferred tax liabilities of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance with
8 generally accepted accounting principles.
9 (f) The amendments made to this section by this act shall apply
10 commencing on and after January 1, 2025.
