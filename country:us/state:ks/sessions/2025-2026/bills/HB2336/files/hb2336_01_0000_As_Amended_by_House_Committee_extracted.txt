14 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
15 New Section 1. (a) Commencing with fiscal year 2026, the director of
16 the budget, in consultation with the director of legislative research, shall
17 certify, at the end of each such fiscal year, the amount of actual corporate
18 income tax receipt revenues generated pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c),
19 and amendments thereto, that is in excess of the prior fiscal year's
20 corporate income tax receipts. The director of the budget shall transmit
21 such certification to the secretary of revenue. Upon receipt of such
22 certification, the secretary shall compute the reduction of the corporate
23 income tax rate pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto.
24 The certified amount shall be computed in dollars by the secretary for a
25 reduction rounded down to the nearest 0.1% in the corporate income tax
26 rate, if any, to go into effect for the next calendar year that would reduce
27 the corporate income tax rate in an amount approximately equal to the
28 amount computed by the secretary. The secretary shall reduce the normal
29 tax on corporations. Such rate reductions shall remain in effect unless
30 further reduced pursuant to law.
31 (b) The secretary shall publish by October 1, 2027, the new income
32 tax rates to take effect on January 1, 2028.
33 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 79-1129 is hereby amended to read as follows: 79-
34 1129. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, a financial institution
35 whose business activity is taxable both within and without this state shall
HB 2336—Am. by HC 2
1 allocate and apportion its net income as provided in this act. All items of
2 nonbusiness income, income which is not includable in the apportionable
3 income tax base, shall be allocated pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A.
4 79-3274 through 79-3278 and amendments thereto. A financial institution
5 organized under the laws of a foreign country, the commonwealth of
6 Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States whose
7 effectively connected income, as defined under the federal internal revenue
8 code, is taxable both within this state and within another state, other than
9 the state in which it is organized, shall allocate and apportion its net
10 income as provided in this act and its apportionment factors shall include
11 the part of its property, payroll and receipts that is related to its
12 apportionable income.
13 (b) (1) For taxable years prior to January 1, 2028 2027, all business
14 income shall be apportioned as follows:
15 (A) All business income, income which is includable in the
16 apportionable income tax base, shall be apportioned to this state by
17 multiplying such income by the apportionment percentage. The
18 apportionment percentage is determined by adding the taxpayer's receipts
19 factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1130, and amendments thereto, property
20 factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1131, and amendments thereto, and
21 payroll factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1132, and amendments thereto,
22 together and dividing the sum by three. If one of the factors is missing, the
23 two remaining factors are added and the sum is divided by two. If two of
24 the factors are missing, the remaining factor is the apportionment
25 percentage. A factor is missing if both its numerator and denominator are
26 zero, but it is not missing merely because its numerator is zero.
27 (B) (i) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2025, and
28 ending before January 1, 2028, at the election of the taxpayer, all business
29 income that is includable in the apportionable income tax base, may be
30 apportioned to this state by the taxpayer's receipts factor, as described in
31 K.S.A. 79-1130, and amendments thereto.
32 (ii) An election under this subparagraph shall be made by including
33 a statement with the original tax return for which the election is made
34 indicating that the taxpayer elects to apply this apportionment method.
35 The election shall be effective and irrevocable for the taxable year of the
36 election and shall be binding on all members of a unitary group of
37 corporations.
38 (2) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2028 2027, all
39 business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the
40 business income by the receipts factor.
41 (c) Each factor shall be computed according to the method of
42 accounting, cash or accrual basis, used by the taxpayer for the taxable year.
43 (d) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this act do not
HB 2336—Am. by HC 3
1 fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state,
2 the taxpayer may petition for or the secretary of revenue may require, in
3 respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:
4 (1) Separate accounting;
5 (2) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
6 (3) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
7 represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or
8 (4) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
9 allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.
10 (e) In the event a combined report is utilized to determine the Kansas
11 income attributable to a unitary group of financial institutions, the
12 financial institutions in the combined group shall include only those
13 institutions which have a branch or office in Kansas.
14 (f) (1) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed in
15 accordance with this subsection.
16 (2) As of July 1, 2025, only publicly traded companies, including
17 affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded
18 company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
19 accepted accounting principles, shall be eligible for this deduction.
20 (3) If the provisions of this section result in an aggregate increase in
21 the taxpayer's net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease in the
22 taxpayer's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
23 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the taxpayer shall be
24 entitled to a deduction, as determined in this subsection. For the purposes
25 of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes a unitary group of businesses
26 that is required to file a combined report. The deferred tax impact
27 deduction provided under this section for a unitary group of businesses
28 that is required to file a combined report shall be calculated using unitary
29 net deferred tax assets and liabilities and deducted against unitary group
30 income.
31 (4) A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deferred tax impact deduction
32 from the taxpayer's net business income before apportionment equal to the
33 amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or
34 decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net
35 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. Such increase in the net
36 deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the
37 aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax
38 liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the
39 imposition of the single sales factor requirements pursuant to this section,
40 excluding the deduction provided under this paragraph, as of the end of
41 the tax year prior to the year in which the taxpayer makes an election or is
42 required to apportion by the sales factor 2025. The amount of the
43 deduction shall equal the annual deferred tax deduction amount set forth
HB 2336—Am. by HC 4
1 in paragraph (5).
2 (5) The annual deferred tax deduction amount shall be calculated as
3 follows:
4 (A) The deferred tax impact determined in paragraph (4) shall be
5 divided by the income tax rate for corporations in effect for the tax year
6 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110, and amendments thereto;
7 (B) the resulting amount shall be further divided by the Kansas
8 apportionment factor that was used by the taxpayer in the calculation of
9 the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as provided in this
10 subsection; and
11 (C) the result multiplied by 1/ shall represent the total net deferred
10
12 tax deduction available for the first tax year beginning on or after January
13 1, 2035, and the next nine successive tax years.
14 (6) The deduction calculated under paragraph (5) shall not be
15 adjusted as a result of any events subsequent to such calculation,
16 including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets.
17 Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to any tax liabilities
18 under the federal internal revenue code and shall not alter the tax basis of
19 any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the taxpayer's
20 net business income before apportionment, any excess deduction shall be
21 carried forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully
22 utilized.
23 (7) At the discretion of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed to
24 claim other available tax credits before claiming the deferred tax
25 deduction calculated under this section. Any deferred tax deduction
26 calculated under this section not claimed on a return shall be carried
27 forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully utilized.
28 (8) Any taxpayer intending to claim a deduction under this subsection
29 shall file a statement with the secretary on or before July 1, 2028 2027,
30 specifying the total amount of the deduction that the taxpayer claims. The
31 statement shall be made on such form and in such manner as prescribed
32 by the secretary and shall contain such information or calculations as the
33 secretary may specify. No deduction shall be allowed under this section
34 for any taxable year except to the extent claimed in the manner prescribed
35 on or before July 1, 2028 2027.
36 (9) For purposes of this subsection:

6 the Kansas department of labor on the quarterly wage reports, in which
7 event it shall either provide an average wage that is above the average
8 wage paid by all Kansas business facilities that share the same assigned
9 NAICS category and that have reported wages for 500 or fewer employees
10 to the Kansas department of labor on the quarterly wage reports, or be the
11 sole Kansas business facility within its assigned NAICS category that has
12 reported wages to the Kansas department of labor on the quarterly wage
13 reports;
14 (v) the number of NAICS digits to use in developing each set of wage
15 thresholds for comparison purposes shall be determined by the secretary of
16 commerce;
17 (vi) the composition of wage regions used in connection with each set
18 of wage thresholds shall be determined by the secretary of commerce; and
19 (vii) alternatively, a taxpayer may wage-qualify its new Kansas
20 business facility if, after excluding the headcount and wages reported on
21 the quarterly wage reports to the Kansas department of labor for
22 employees at that new Kansas business facility who own five percent or
23 more equity in the taxpayer, the average wage calculated for the taxpayer's
24 new Kansas business facility is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the
25 aggregate state-wide average wage paid by industries covered by the
26 employment security law based on data maintained by the secretary of
27 labor.
28 (B) For the purposes of the wage requirements in paragraph (A), the
29 number of full-time equivalent employees shall be determined by dividing
30 the number of hours worked by part-time employees during the pertinent
31 measurement interval by an amount equal to the corresponding multiple of
32 a 40-hour work week and adding the quotient to the average number of
33 full-time employees.
34 (C) When the qualifying taxpayer is part of a unitary group, the
35 business income of the unitary group attributable to the qualifying
36 taxpayer shall be determined by multiplying the business income of the
37 unitary group by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor
38 plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which
39 is three. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
40 average value of the qualifying taxpayer's real and tangible personal
41 property owned or rented and used during the tax period and the
42 denominator of which is the average value of the unitary group's real and
43 tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.
HB 2336—Am. by HC 12
1 The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount
2 paid during the tax period by the qualifying taxpayer for compensation,
3 and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid by the unitary
4 group during the tax period. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
5 which is the total sales of the qualifying taxpayer during the tax period,
6 and the denominator of which is the total sales of the unitary group during
7 the tax period.
8 (D) For purposes of this subsection, the secretary of revenue, upon a
9 showing of good cause and after receiving a certification by the secretary
10 of commerce of substantial compliance with provisions of this subsection
11 (b)(6) (a)(6), may extend any required performance date provided in this
12 subsection (b)(6) (a)(6) for a period not to exceed six months.
13 (b) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2025, and
14 before January 1, 2028, at the election of the taxpayer, all business income
15 of any other taxpayer may be apportioned to this state by multiplying such
16 taxpayer's business income by the sales factor. An election under this
17 subsection shall be made by including a statement with the original tax
18 return for which the election is made indicating that the taxpayer elects to
19 apply this apportionment method. The election shall be effective and
20 irrevocable for the taxable year of the election.
21 (c) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2028 2027, all
22 business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the
23 business income by the sales factor.
24 (d)(c) Any taxpayer having previously made an election pursuant to
25 subsection (a)(2) shall be permitted to make a new election pursuant to
26 subsection (b) apportion income through the use of the single sales
27 factor.
28 (e)(d) (1) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed
29 in accordance with this subsection.
30 (2) As of July 1, 2025, only publicly traded companies, including
31 affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded
32 company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
33 accepted accounting principles, shall be eligible for this deduction.
34 (3) If the provisions of this section result in an aggregate increase in
35 the taxpayer's net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease in the
36 taxpayer's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
37 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the taxpayer shall be
38 entitled to a deduction, as determined in this subsection. For the purposes
39 of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes a unitary group of businesses
40 that is required to file a combined report. The deferred tax impact
41 deduction provided under this section for a unitary group of businesses
42 that is required to file a combined report shall be calculated using unitary
43 net deferred tax assets and liabilities and deducted against unitary group
HB 2336—Am. by HC 13
1 income.
2 (4) A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deferred tax impact deduction
3 from the taxpayer's net business income before apportionment equal to the
4 amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or
5 decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net
6 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. Such increase in the net
7 deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the
8 aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax
9 liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the
10 imposition of the single sales factor requirements pursuant to this section,
11 excluding the deduction provided under this paragraph, as of the end of
12 the tax year prior to the year in which the taxpayer makes an election or is
13 required to apportion by the sales factor 2025. The amount of the
14 deduction shall equal the annual deferred tax deduction amount set forth
15 in paragraph (5).
16 (5) The annual deferred tax deduction amount shall be calculated as
17 follows:
18 (A) The deferred tax impact determined in paragraph (4) shall be
19 divided by the income tax rate for corporations in effect for the tax year
20 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110, and amendments thereto;
21 (B) the resulting amount shall be further divided by the Kansas
22 apportionment factor that was used by the taxpayer in the calculation of
23 the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as provided in this
24 subsection; and
25 (C) the result multiplied by 1/ shall represent the total net deferred
10
26 tax deduction available for the first tax year beginning on or after January
27 1, 2035, and the next nine successive tax years.
28 (6) The deduction calculated under paragraph (5) shall not be
29 adjusted as a result of any events subsequent to such calculation,
30 including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets.
31 Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to any tax liabilities
32 under the federal internal revenue code and shall not alter the tax basis of
33 any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the taxpayer's
34 net business income before apportionment, any excess deduction shall be
35 carried forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully
36 utilized.
37 (7) At the discretion of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed to
38 claim other available tax credits before claiming the deferred tax
39 deduction calculated under this section. Any deferred tax deduction
40 calculated under this section not claimed on a return shall be carried
41 forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully utilized.
42 (8) Any taxpayer intending to claim a deduction under this subsection
43 shall file a statement with the secretary on or before July 1, 2028 2027,
HB 2336—Am. by HC 14
1 specifying the total amount of the deduction that the taxpayer claims on
2 such form and in such manner as prescribed by the secretary and shall
3 contain such information or calculations as the secretary may specify. No
4 deduction shall be allowed under this section for any taxable year except
5 to the extent claimed in the manner prescribed on or before July 1, 2028
6 2027.
7 (9) For purposes of this subsection:
8 (A) "Net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that
9 exceed the deferred tax assets of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance
10 with generally accepted accounting principles.
11 (B) "Net deferred tax asset" means that deferred tax assets exceed the
12 deferred tax liabilities of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance with
13 generally accepted accounting principles.
14 (f) Any manufacturer of alcoholic liquor as defined in K.S.A. 41-
15 102, and amendments thereto, who sells to a distributor as defined in
16 K.S.A. 41-102, and amendments thereto, shall be apportioned to this
17 state by multiplying the business income by a fraction, the numerator
18 of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor and the sales
19 factor, and the denominator of which is three.
20 (g) The amendments made to this section by this act shall apply
21 commencing on and after January 1, 2025.

Raw Text:
As Amended by House Committee
Session of 2025
HOUSE BILL No. 2336
By Committee on Taxation
Requested by Eric Stafford on behalf of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce
2-7
1 AN ACT concerning taxation; relating to income and privilege taxes;
2 providing for the apportionment of business income by the single sales
3 factor and the apportionment of financial institution income by the
4 receipts factor; providing for the apportionment pursuant to the
5 three-factor test of a manufacturer who sells alcoholic liquor;
6 establishing deductions from income when using the single sales factor
7 and receipts factor; providing for the decrease in corporate income tax
8 rates; determining when sales other than tangible personal property are
9 made in the state; excluding sales of a unitary business group of electric
10 and natural gas public utilities; amending K.S.A. 79-1129, 79-3271, 79-
11 3279 and 79-3287 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,110 and 79-32,113 and
12 repealing the existing sections.
13
14 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
15 New Section 1. (a) Commencing with fiscal year 2026, the director of
16 the budget, in consultation with the director of legislative research, shall
17 certify, at the end of each such fiscal year, the amount of actual corporate
18 income tax receipt revenues generated pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c),
19 and amendments thereto, that is in excess of the prior fiscal year's
20 corporate income tax receipts. The director of the budget shall transmit
21 such certification to the secretary of revenue. Upon receipt of such
22 certification, the secretary shall compute the reduction of the corporate
23 income tax rate pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto.
24 The certified amount shall be computed in dollars by the secretary for a
25 reduction rounded down to the nearest 0.1% in the corporate income tax
26 rate, if any, to go into effect for the next calendar year that would reduce
27 the corporate income tax rate in an amount approximately equal to the
28 amount computed by the secretary. The secretary shall reduce the normal
29 tax on corporations. Such rate reductions shall remain in effect unless
30 further reduced pursuant to law.
31 (b) The secretary shall publish by October 1, 2027, the new income

33 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 79-1129 is hereby amended to read as follows: 79-
34 1129. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, a financial institution
35 whose business activity is taxable both within and without this state shall

HB 2336—Am. by HC 2
1 allocate and apportion its net income as provided in this act. All items of
2 nonbusiness income, income which is not includable in the apportionable
3 income tax base, shall be allocated pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A.
4 79-3274 through 79-3278 and amendments thereto. A financial institution
5 organized under the laws of a foreign country, the commonwealth of
6 Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States whose
7 effectively connected income, as defined under the federal internal revenue
8 code, is taxable both within this state and within another state, other than
9 the state in which it is organized, shall allocate and apportion its net
10 income as provided in this act and its apportionment factors shall include
11 the part of its property, payroll and receipts that is related to its
12 apportionable income.
13 (b) (1) For taxable years prior to January 1, 2028 2027, all business
14 income shall be apportioned as follows:
15 (A) All business income, income which is includable in the
16 apportionable income tax base, shall be apportioned to this state by
17 multiplying such income by the apportionment percentage. The
18 apportionment percentage is determined by adding the taxpayer's receipts
19 factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1130, and amendments thereto, property
20 factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1131, and amendments thereto, and
21 payroll factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1132, and amendments thereto,
22 together and dividing the sum by three. If one of the factors is missing, the
23 two remaining factors are added and the sum is divided by two. If two of
24 the factors are missing, the remaining factor is the apportionment
25 percentage. A factor is missing if both its numerator and denominator are
26 zero, but it is not missing merely because its numerator is zero.
27 (B) (i) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2025, and
28 ending before January 1, 2028, at the election of the taxpayer, all business
29 income that is includable in the apportionable income tax base, may be
30 apportioned to this state by the taxpayer's receipts factor, as described in
31 K.S.A. 79-1130, and amendments thereto.
32 (ii) An election under this subparagraph shall be made by including
33 a statement with the original tax return for which the election is made
34 indicating that the taxpayer elects to apply this apportionment method.
35 The election shall be effective and irrevocable for the taxable year of the
36 election and shall be binding on all members of a unitary group of
37 corporations.
38 (2) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2028 2027, all
39 business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the
40 business income by the receipts factor.
41 (c) Each factor shall be computed according to the method of
42 accounting, cash or accrual basis, used by the taxpayer for the taxable year.
43 (d) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this act do not

HB 2336—Am. by HC 3
1 fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state,
2 the taxpayer may petition for or the secretary of revenue may require, in
3 respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable:
4 (1) Separate accounting;
5 (2) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors;
6 (3) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly
7 represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or
8 (4) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable
9 allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.
10 (e) In the event a combined report is utilized to determine the Kansas
11 income attributable to a unitary group of financial institutions, the
12 financial institutions in the combined group shall include only those
13 institutions which have a branch or office in Kansas.
14 (f) (1) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed in
15 accordance with this subsection.
16 (2) As of July 1, 2025, only publicly traded companies, including
17 affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded
18 company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
19 accepted accounting principles, shall be eligible for this deduction.
20 (3) If the provisions of this section result in an aggregate increase in
21 the taxpayer's net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease in the
22 taxpayer's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
23 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the taxpayer shall be
24 entitled to a deduction, as determined in this subsection. For the purposes
25 of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes a unitary group of businesses
26 that is required to file a combined report. The deferred tax impact
27 deduction provided under this section for a unitary group of businesses
28 that is required to file a combined report shall be calculated using unitary
29 net deferred tax assets and liabilities and deducted against unitary group
30 income.
31 (4) A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deferred tax impact deduction
32 from the taxpayer's net business income before apportionment equal to the
33 amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or
34 decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net
35 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. Such increase in the net
36 deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the
37 aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax
38 liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the
39 imposition of the single sales factor requirements pursuant to this section,
40 excluding the deduction provided under this paragraph, as of the end of
41 the tax year prior to the year in which the taxpayer makes an election or is
42 required to apportion by the sales factor 2025. The amount of the
43 deduction shall equal the annual deferred tax deduction amount set forth

HB 2336—Am. by HC 4
1 in paragraph (5).
2 (5) The annual deferred tax deduction amount shall be calculated as
3 follows:
4 (A) The deferred tax impact determined in paragraph (4) shall be
5 divided by the income tax rate for corporations in effect for the tax year
6 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110, and amendments thereto;
7 (B) the resulting amount shall be further divided by the Kansas
8 apportionment factor that was used by the taxpayer in the calculation of
9 the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as provided in this
10 subsection; and
11 (C) the result multiplied by 1/ shall represent the total net deferred
10
12 tax deduction available for the first tax year beginning on or after January
13 1, 2035, and the next nine successive tax years.
14 (6) The deduction calculated under paragraph (5) shall not be
15 adjusted as a result of any events subsequent to such calculation,
16 including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets.
17 Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to any tax liabilities
18 under the federal internal revenue code and shall not alter the tax basis of
19 any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the taxpayer's
20 net business income before apportionment, any excess deduction shall be
21 carried forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully
22 utilized.
23 (7) At the discretion of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed to
24 claim other available tax credits before claiming the deferred tax
25 deduction calculated under this section. Any deferred tax deduction
26 calculated under this section not claimed on a return shall be carried
27 forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully utilized.
28 (8) Any taxpayer intending to claim a deduction under this subsection
29 shall file a statement with the secretary on or before July 1, 2028 2027,
30 specifying the total amount of the deduction that the taxpayer claims. The
31 statement shall be made on such form and in such manner as prescribed
32 by the secretary and shall contain such information or calculations as the
33 secretary may specify. No deduction shall be allowed under this section
34 for any taxable year except to the extent claimed in the manner prescribed
35 on or before July 1, 2028 2027.
36 (9) For purposes of this subsection:
37 (A) "Net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that
38 exceed the deferred tax assets of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance
39 with generally accepted accounting principles.
40 (B) "Net deferred tax asset" means that deferred tax assets exceed the

42 generally accepted accounting principles.

18 paragraph (A). If the qualifying taxpayer is a member of a unitary group of
19 corporations, all other members of the unitary group doing business within
20 this state shall apportion their business income to this state pursuant to

15 thresholds for comparison purposes shall be determined by the secretary of
16 commerce;
17 (vi) the composition of wage regions used in connection with each set
18 of wage thresholds shall be determined by the secretary of commerce; and
19 (vii) alternatively, a taxpayer may wage-qualify its new Kansas
20 business facility if, after excluding the headcount and wages reported on
21 the quarterly wage reports to the Kansas department of labor for
22 employees at that new Kansas business facility who own five percent or
23 more equity in the taxpayer, the average wage calculated for the taxpayer's
24 new Kansas business facility is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the
25 aggregate state-wide average wage paid by industries covered by the
26 employment security law based on data maintained by the secretary of
27 labor.
28 (B) For the purposes of the wage requirements in paragraph (A), the
29 number of full-time equivalent employees shall be determined by dividing
30 the number of hours worked by part-time employees during the pertinent
31 measurement interval by an amount equal to the corresponding multiple of
32 a 40-hour work week and adding the quotient to the average number of
33 full-time employees.
34 (C) When the qualifying taxpayer is part of a unitary group, the

38 plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which
39 is three. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
40 average value of the qualifying taxpayer's real and tangible personal
41 property owned or rented and used during the tax period and the
42 denominator of which is the average value of the unitary group's real and

2 paid during the tax period by the qualifying taxpayer for compensation,
3 and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid by the unitary
4 group during the tax period. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of
5 which is the total sales of the qualifying taxpayer during the tax period,
6 and the denominator of which is the total sales of the unitary group during

8 (D) For purposes of this subsection, the secretary of revenue, upon a
9 showing of good cause and after receiving a certification by the secretary
10 of commerce of substantial compliance with provisions of this subsection
11 (b)(6) (a)(6), may extend any required performance date provided in this
12 subsection (b)(6) (a)(6) for a period not to exceed six months.
13 (b) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2025, and
14 before January 1, 2028, at the election of the taxpayer, all business income
15 of any other taxpayer may be apportioned to this state by multiplying such
16 taxpayer's business income by the sales factor. An election under this
17 subsection shall be made by including a statement with the original tax
18 return for which the election is made indicating that the taxpayer elects to
19 apply this apportionment method. The election shall be effective and
20 irrevocable for the taxable year of the election.
21 (c) For tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2028 2027, all
22 business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the
23 business income by the sales factor.
24 (d)(c) Any taxpayer having previously made an election pursuant to
25 subsection (a)(2) shall be permitted to make a new election pursuant to
26 subsection (b) apportion income through the use of the single sales
27 factor.
28 (e)(d) (1) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed
29 in accordance with this subsection.
30 (2) As of July 1, 2025, only publicly traded companies, including
31 affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded
32 company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally
33 accepted accounting principles, shall be eligible for this deduction.
34 (3) If the provisions of this section result in an aggregate increase in
35 the taxpayer's net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease in the
36 taxpayer's net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net
37 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the taxpayer shall be
38 entitled to a deduction, as determined in this subsection. For the purposes
39 of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes a unitary group of businesses
40 that is required to file a combined report. The deferred tax impact
41 deduction provided under this section for a unitary group of businesses
42 that is required to file a combined report shall be calculated using unitary
43 net deferred tax assets and liabilities and deducted against unitary group

HB 2336—Am. by HC 13
1 income.
2 (4) A taxpayer shall be entitled to a deferred tax impact deduction
3 from the taxpayer's net business income before apportionment equal to the
4 amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or
5 decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net
6 deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability. Such increase in the net
7 deferred tax liability, decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the
8 aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax
9 liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the
10 imposition of the single sales factor requirements pursuant to this section,
11 excluding the deduction provided under this paragraph, as of the end of
12 the tax year prior to the year in which the taxpayer makes an election or is
13 required to apportion by the sales factor 2025. The amount of the
14 deduction shall equal the annual deferred tax deduction amount set forth
15 in paragraph (5).
16 (5) The annual deferred tax deduction amount shall be calculated as
17 follows:
18 (A) The deferred tax impact determined in paragraph (4) shall be
19 divided by the income tax rate for corporations in effect for the tax year
20 pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110, and amendments thereto;
21 (B) the resulting amount shall be further divided by the Kansas
22 apportionment factor that was used by the taxpayer in the calculation of
23 the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as provided in this
24 subsection; and
25 (C) the result multiplied by 1/ shall represent the total net deferred
10
26 tax deduction available for the first tax year beginning on or after January
27 1, 2035, and the next nine successive tax years.
28 (6) The deduction calculated under paragraph (5) shall not be
29 adjusted as a result of any events subsequent to such calculation,
30 including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets.
31 Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to any tax liabilities
32 under the federal internal revenue code and shall not alter the tax basis of
33 any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than the taxpayer's
34 net business income before apportionment, any excess deduction shall be
35 carried forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully
36 utilized.
37 (7) At the discretion of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be allowed to
38 claim other available tax credits before claiming the deferred tax
39 deduction calculated under this section. Any deferred tax deduction
40 calculated under this section not claimed on a return shall be carried
41 forward and applied as a deduction for future tax years until fully utilized.
42 (8) Any taxpayer intending to claim a deduction under this subsection
43 shall file a statement with the secretary on or before July 1, 2028 2027,

HB 2336—Am. by HC 14
1 specifying the total amount of the deduction that the taxpayer claims on
2 such form and in such manner as prescribed by the secretary and shall
3 contain such information or calculations as the secretary may specify. No
4 deduction shall be allowed under this section for any taxable year except
5 to the extent claimed in the manner prescribed on or before July 1, 2028
6 2027.
7 (9) For purposes of this subsection:

9 exceed the deferred tax assets of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance
10 with generally accepted accounting principles.
11 (B) "Net deferred tax asset" means that deferred tax assets exceed the
12 deferred tax liabilities of the taxpayer, as computed in accordance with

15 102, and amendments thereto, who sells to a distributor as defined in

17 state by multiplying the business income by a fraction, the numerator
18 of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor and the sales
19 factor, and the denominator of which is three.
20 (g) The amendments made to this section by this act shall apply
21 commencing on and after January 1, 2025.
