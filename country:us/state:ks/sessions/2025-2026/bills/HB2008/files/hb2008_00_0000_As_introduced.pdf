37 trustees may direct. If upon such medical examination the examiners
38 report to the board that the retirant is physically able and capable of
39 resuming employment with the participating employer from whose
40 employment the correctional employee retired, the disability benefits shall
41 terminate. A retirant who has been receiving benefits under the provisions

9 subsection (6) shall be sufficient cause for suspending or discontinuing
10 benefit payments under this section and if such refusal or neglect shall
11 continue for a period of one year, the correctional employee's rights in and
12 to all benefits under the system may be revoked by the board.

24 employee already retired on the effective date of this act, no reduction of
25 the original social security benefits shall be applicable to benefits paid
26 prior to the effective date of this act. In no case shall a correctional
27 employee who is entitled to receive benefits under this section receive less
