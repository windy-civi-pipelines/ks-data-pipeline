22 not contain information that identifies any person who reported the abuse
23 or neglect.
24 (h) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
25 except as provided in paragraph (6), in the event that child abuse or
26 neglect results in a child fatality or near fatality, reports or records of a
27 child alleged or adjudicated to be in need of care received by the secretary,
28 a law enforcement agency or any juvenile intake and assessment worker
29 shall become a public record and subject to disclosure pursuant to K.S.A.
30 45-215, and amendments thereto.
31 (2) Within seven days of receipt of a request in accordance with the
32 procedures adopted under K.S.A. 45-220, and amendments thereto, the
33 secretary shall notify any affected individual that an open records request
34 has been made concerning such records. The secretary or any affected
35 individual may file a motion requesting the court to prevent disclosure of
36 such record or report, or any select portion thereof. Notice of the filing of
37 such motion shall be provided to all parties requesting the records or
38 reports, and such party or parties shall have a right to hearing, upon
39 request, prior to the entry of any order on such motion. If the affected
40 individual does not file such motion within seven days of notification, and
41 the secretary has not filed a motion, the secretary shall release the reports
42 or records. If such motion is filed, the court shall consider the effect such
43 disclosure may have upon an ongoing criminal investigation, a pending

HB 2093 5
1 prosecution, or the privacy of the child, if living, or the child's siblings,
2 parents or guardians, and the public's interest in the disclosure of such
3 records or reports. The court shall make written findings on the record
4 justifying the closing of the records and shall provide a copy of the journal
5 entry to the affected parties and the individual requesting disclosure
6 pursuant to the Kansas open records act, K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., and
7 amendments thereto.
8 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), in the event that
9 child abuse or neglect results in a child fatality or criminal charges are
10 filed with a court alleging that a person caused a child fatality, the
11 secretary shall release the following information in response to an open
12 records request made pursuant to the Kansas open records act, within
13 seven business days of receipt of such request, as allowed by applicable
14 law:
15 (A) Age and sex of the child;
16 (B) date of the fatality;
17 (C) a summary of any previous reports of abuse or neglect received
18 by the secretary involving the child, along with the findings of such
19 reports; and
20 (D) any department recommended services provided to the child.
21 (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), in the event that
22 a child fatality occurs while such child was in the custody of the secretary
23 for children and families, the secretary shall release the following
24 information in response to an open records request made pursuant to the
25 Kansas open records act, within seven business days of receipt of such
26 request, as allowed by applicable law:
27 (A) Age and sex of the child;
28 (B) date of the fatality; and
29 (C) a summary of the facts surrounding the death of the child.
30 (5) For reports or records requested pursuant to this subsection, the
31 time limitations specified in this subsection shall control to the extent of
32 any inconsistency between this subsection and K.S.A. 45-218, and
33 amendments thereto. As used in this section, "near fatality" means an act
34 that, as certified by a person licensed to practice medicine and surgery,
35 places the child in serious or critical condition.
36 (6) Nothing in this subsection shall allow the disclosure of reports,
37 records or documents concerning the child and such child's biological
38 parents that were created prior to such child's adoption. Nothing herein is
39 intended to require that an otherwise privileged communication lose its
40 privileged character.
