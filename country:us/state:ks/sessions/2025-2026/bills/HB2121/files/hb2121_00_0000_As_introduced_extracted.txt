33 increased during the multi-year registration period, the owner of the trailer
34 with such multi-year registration shall be subject to the amount of the

26 motorized bicycle, trailer, semitrailer, travel trailer, or pole trailer is either
27 purchased or acquired after the anniversary or renewal date in any
28 registration year there shall immediately become due and payable a

30 anniversary or renewal date of any registration year and the first six
31 months of such registration year, the annual fee provided herein; if

33 50% of such annual fee. If any truck or truck tractor, except trucks subject
34 to K.S.A. 8-134a, and amendments thereto, is purchased or acquired prior
35 to April 1 of any year the fee shall be the annual fee provided herein, but if
36 such truck or truck tractor is purchased or acquired after the end of March
37 of any year, the license fee for such year shall be reduced 1/ for each
12
38 calendar month which has elapsed since the beginning of the year. If any
39 truck registered for a gross weight of 12,000 pounds or less or passenger
40 vehicle is purchased or acquired and less than 12 months remain in the
41 registration period, the fee shall be 1/ of the annual fee for each calendar
12
42 month remaining in the registration period.
43 (d) The owner of any motorcycle, motorized bicycle, passenger

HB 2121 9
1 vehicle, truck, truck tractor, trailer, semitrailer, or electrically propelled
2 vehicle who fails to pay the registration fee or fees herein provided on the
3 date when the same become due and payable shall be guilty of a
4 misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a penalty in
5 the sum of $1 for each month or fraction thereof during which such fee has
6 remained unpaid after it became due and payable; and in addition thereto
7 shall be subject to such other punishment as is provided in this act. Upon

10 have been paid for the year in which the transfer is made, either: (1) To a
11 corporation by one or more persons, solely in exchange for stock or
12 securities in such corporation; or (2) by one corporation to another
13 corporation when all of the assets of such corporation are transferred to the
14 other corporation, then in either case, paragraph (1) or (2) the corporation
15 shall be exempt from the payment of registration fees on such vehicles for
16 the year in which such transfer is made. Applications for transfer or
17 registration shall be accompanied by a fee of $1.50. When the registration
18 of a vehicle has expired at midnight on the last day of any registration
19 year, and such vehicle is not thereafter operated upon the highways, any
20 application for renewal of registration made subsequent to the anniversary
21 or renewal date of any registration year following the expiration of such
22 registration and for succeeding registration years in which such vehicle has
23 not been registered shall be accompanied by an affidavit of nonoperation
24 and nonuse, and such application for renewal or registration shall be
25 received by the division of vehicles upon payment of the proper fees for
26 the current registration year and without penalty.
27 (e) Any nonresident of Kansas purchasing a vehicle from a Kansas
28 resident and desiring to secure registration on the vehicle in the state of
29 such person's residence may make application in the office of any county
30 treasurer for a sixty-day temporary registration. The county treasurer upon
31 presentation of evidence of ownership in the applicant and evidence the
32 sales tax has been paid, if due, shall charge and collect a fee of $3 for each
33 sixty-day temporary license and issue a sticker or paper registration as may
34 be determined by the director of vehicles, and the registration so issued
35 shall be valid for a period of 60 days from the date of issuance.
36 (f) Any owner of any motor vehicle that is subject to taxation under
37 the provisions of article 51 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
38 and amendments thereto, or any other truck or truck tractor where the
39 annual registration fee has been paid and the vehicle is sold, junked,
40 repossessed, foreclosed by a mechanic's lien or title transferred by
41 operation of law, and the registration thereon is not going to be transferred
42 to another vehicle may secure a refund for the registration fee for the
43 remaining portion of the year by making application to the division of

HB 2121 10
1 vehicles on a form and in the manner prescribed by the director of
2 vehicles, accompanied by all license plates and attachments issued in
3 connection therewith. If the owner of the registration becomes deceased
4 and the vehicle is not going to be used on the highway, and title is not
5 being currently transferred, the proper representative of the estate shall be
6 entitled to the refund. The refund shall be made only for the period of time
7 remaining in the registration year from the date of completion and filing of
8 the application with and delivery of the license plate and attachments to
9 the division of vehicles. Where the registration is secured under a quarterly
10 payment annual registration fee, as provided for in K.S.A. 8-143a, and
11 amendments thereto, such refund shall be made on the quarterly fee paid
12 and unused and all remaining quarterly payments shall be canceled. Any
13 truck or truck tractor having the registration fee paid on quarterly payment
14 basis, all quarterly payments due or a fraction of quarterly payment due
15 shall be paid before title may be transferred, except that in case of death,
16 the filing of the application and returning of the license plate and
17 attachment shall cancel the remaining annual payments due. Whenever a
18 truck or truck tractor, where the registration is secured on a quarterly
19 payment of the annual registration, the one repossessing the truck or truck

23 for the remaining portion of the year shall not be canceled unless
24 application is made and the license plate and attachments are surrendered.
25 Nothing in this subsection shall apply when registration is secured under
26 the provisions of K.S.A. 8-1,101 through 8-1,123, and amendments
27 thereto. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section,
28 no refund shall be made under the provisions of this section where the
29 amount thereof does not exceed $5. The division of vehicles shall furnish
30 such blank forms as may be required under the provisions of this
31 subsection as it deems necessary to be completed by the applicant.
32 Whenever a registration which has been secured on a quarterly basis shall
33 be canceled as provided in this subsection, the division of vehicles shall
34 notify the county treasurer issuing the original registration of such
35 cancellation so that the county treasurer may, and the county treasurer shall
36 cancel the registration of such vehicle in the county treasurer's office and
37 release any lien issued in connection with such registration.

7 highways of this state until all taxes levied against such vehicle have been
8 paid. A copy of such registration form shall be sent to the county clerk or
9 assessor of the county to which such vehicle is being moved. When such
10 travel trailer is used for living quarters and not operated on the highways,
11 the owner shall be exempt from the license fees as provided in subsection
12 (b)(9) so long as such travel trailer is not operated on the highway.
