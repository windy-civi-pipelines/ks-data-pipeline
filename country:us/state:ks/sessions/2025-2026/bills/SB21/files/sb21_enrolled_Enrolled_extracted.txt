or violation, if it can be cured. If the commission finds that the failure
or violation has not been cured upon expiration of the 30 days or upon
a later deadline granted by the commission, or if the alleged violation is
of such a nature that it cannot be cured, the commission may proceed to
suspend or revoke the licensee's license pursuant to subsection (i)(j).

commission from imposing a fine pursuant to subsection (i)(j) even if
the violation is cured within 30 days or such other period as provided
by the commission.
(k)(l) If an applicant for a facility owner license proposes to
construct a racetrack facility and the commission determines that such
license should be issued to the applicant, the commission shall issue to
the applicant a facility owner license conditioned on the submission by
the licensee to the commission, within a period of time prescribed by
the commission, of a commitment for financing the construction of the
racetrack facility by a financial institution or other source, subject to
approval by the commission. If such commitment is not submitted

the plans submitted to the commission pursuant to subsection (e), the
commission, in accordance with the Kansas administrative procedure
act, shall:

reasonable cause for the failure to complete the facility.

procedure act and shall be subject to review under the Kansas judicial
review act.
(n)(o) The grant or denial of an original facility owner license or
facility manager license shall not be subject to the Kansas
administrative procedure act. Such grant or denial shall be a matter to
be determined in the sole discretion of the commission, whose decision
shall be final upon the grant of a license to one of two or more
competing applicants without the necessity of a hearing on the denial of
a license to each other competing applicant. Any action for judicial
review of such decision shall be by appeal to the supreme court in
accordance with the Kansas judicial review act, except that the scope of
review shall be limited to whether the action of the commission was
arbitrary or capricious or constituted an abuse of discretion. All
competing applicants for the facility owner license or facility manager
license shall be parties to such appeal. Any such appeal shall have
priority over other cases except those having statutory priority.
(o)(p) The commission may adopt rules and regulations regulating
crossover employment between facility manager licensees and facility

in activities relating to ownership or management of a racetrack facility
or to the conduct of races has been so convicted or adjudicated;
(3) has been convicted by a court of any state or of the United
States of any felony involving dishonesty, fraud, theft, counterfeiting,
alcohol violations or embezzlement, or has been adjudicated in the last

license is a horsemen's association, such applicant shall not operate

(i) All facility owner licenses and facility manager licenses shall
be reviewed annually by the commission to determine if the licensee is
complying with the provisions of this act and rules and regulations of
the commission and following such proposed plans and operating
procedures as were approved by the commission. The commission may
review a facility owner license or facility manager license more often
than annually upon its own initiative or upon the request of any
interested party. The commission shall require each facility owner
licensee and each facility manager licensee to file annually with the

SENATE BILL No. 21—page 7
commission a certified financial audit of the licensee by an independent
certified public accountant, which audit shall be open to inspection by
the public, and may require any such licensee to provide any other
information necessary for the commission to conduct the annual or
periodic review.
(i)(j) Subject to the provisions of subsection (j)(k), the
commission, in accordance with the Kansas administrative procedure
act, may suspend or revoke a facility owner or facility manager license
or may impose a civil fine not exceeding $10,000 per failure or
violation, or may both suspend such license and impose such fine, if the
commission finds probable cause to believe that:
(1) In the case of a facility owner licensee, the licensee has failed
to follow one or more provisions of the licensee's plans for the
financing, construction or operation of a racetrack facility as submitted
to and approved by the commission; or
(2) in the case of either a facility owner licensee or facility
manager licensee, the licensee has violated any of the terms and
conditions of licensure provided by this section or any other provision
of this act or any rule and regulation of the commission.
(j)(k) Prior to suspension or revocation of a license pursuant to
subsection (i)(j), the commission shall give written notice of the reason
therefor to the licensee and all other interested parties. The licensee
shall have 30 days from receipt of the notice to cure the alleged failure
or violation, if it can be cured. If the commission finds that the failure
or violation has not been cured upon expiration of the 30 days or upon
a later deadline granted by the commission, or if the alleged violation is
of such a nature that it cannot be cured, the commission may proceed to
suspend or revoke the licensee's license pursuant to subsection (i)(j).
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the
commission from imposing a fine pursuant to subsection (i)(j) even if
the violation is cured within 30 days or such other period as provided
by the commission.
(k)(l) If an applicant for a facility owner license proposes to
construct a racetrack facility and the commission determines that such
license should be issued to the applicant, the commission shall issue to
the applicant a facility owner license conditioned on the submission by
the licensee to the commission, within a period of time prescribed by
the commission, of a commitment for financing the construction of the
racetrack facility by a financial institution or other source, subject to
approval by the commission. If such commitment is not submitted
within the period of time originally prescribed by the commission or
such additional time as authorized by the commission, the license shall
expire at the end of such period.
(l)(m) If a facility owner licensee's license authorizes the
construction of a dual racetrack facility, such license shall be
conditioned on the completion of such facility within a time specified
by the commission. If, within the time specified by the commission, the
licensee has not constructed a dual racetrack facility in accordance with
the plans submitted to the commission pursuant to subsection (e), the
commission, in accordance with the Kansas administrative procedure
act, shall:
(1) Impose upon the licensee a civil fine equal to 5% of the total
parimutuel pools for all races held at the licensee's facility on and after
the date that racing with parimutuel wagering is first conducted at such
facility and until the date that construction of the dual racetrack facility
is completed and horse racing has begun; and
(2) revoke the licensee's license unless the licensee demonstrates
reasonable cause for the failure to complete the facility.
(m)(n) The refusal to renew a facility owner license or a facility

SENATE BILL No. 21—page 8
manager license shall be in accordance with the Kansas administrative
procedure act and shall be subject to review under the Kansas judicial
review act.
(n)(o) The grant or denial of an original facility owner license or
facility manager license shall not be subject to the Kansas
administrative procedure act. Such grant or denial shall be a matter to
be determined in the sole discretion of the commission, whose decision
shall be final upon the grant of a license to one of two or more
competing applicants without the necessity of a hearing on the denial of
a license to each other competing applicant. Any action for judicial
review of such decision shall be by appeal to the supreme court in
accordance with the Kansas judicial review act, except that the scope of
review shall be limited to whether the action of the commission was
arbitrary or capricious or constituted an abuse of discretion. All
competing applicants for the facility owner license or facility manager
license shall be parties to such appeal. Any such appeal shall have
priority over other cases except those having statutory priority.
(o)(p) The commission may adopt rules and regulations regulating
crossover employment between facility manager licensees and facility
owner licensees and organization licensees.
Sec. 4. K.S.A. 74-8826 is hereby amended to read as follows: 74-
8826. (a) There is hereby created the state racing fund in the state
treasury.
(b) Except as otherwise provided by K.S.A. 74-8824 and 74-8835,

tax, application fees, license fees and fines which that are collected by
the commission shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance
with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon
receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the
entire amount in the state treasury to the credit of the state racing fund.
All moneys credited to such fund shall be expended or transferred only
for the purposes and in the manner provided by this act. Expenditures
from such fund shall be made in accordance with appropriation acts
upon warrants of the director of accounts and reports issued pursuant to
vouchers approved by the chairperson of the commission or a person
designated by the chairperson.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by this act, all operating
expenses of the commission and moneys for the promotion of horse
and greyhound racing appropriated by the legislature shall be paid from
