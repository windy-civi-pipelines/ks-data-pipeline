11 act.
12 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this act, a conservation easement
13 may be created, conveyed, recorded, assigned, released, modified,
14 terminated or otherwise altered or affected in the same manner as other
15 easements.
16 (c) No right or duty in favor of or against a holder and no right in
17 favor of a person having a third-party right of enforcement arises under a
18 conservation easement before its acceptance by the holder and a
19 recordation of the acceptance.
20 (d) Except as provided in subsection (b) of K.S.A. 58-3812(b) and
21 unless the instrument creating it otherwise provides, a conservation
22 easement shall be limited in duration to the lifetime of the grantor and may
23 be revoked at grantor's request.
24 (e) An interest in real property in existence at the time a conservation
25 easement is created is not impaired by it unless the owner of the interest is
26 a grantor of the conservation easement.
27 (f) A conservation easement may not be conveyed or assigned by a
28 holder to any entity or person other than a city or county of this state, an
29 entity enumerated by subsection (b)(2) of K.S.A. 58-3810(b)(2) or the
30 grantor thereof or such grantor's heirs.
31 (g) In order to minimize conflicts with land-use planning, each
32 proposed conservation easement shall be approved by the appropriate
33 board of county commissioners or city governing body.
34 When a proposed conservation easement is located on property outside
35 the planning jurisdiction of a city, the board of county commissioners shall

HB 2363 2

3 hearing within 60 days of the receipt of the proposed conservation
4 easement regarding the conformity of the proposed easement to the

6 within 60 days, the proposed acquisition shall be deemed approved by the
7 county planning commission and the matter shall be considered by the
8 board of county commissioners.

10 the zoning jurisdiction of a city, the governing body of the city shall refer
11 the proposed conservation easement to the city planning commission for
12 review and recommendation. If the planning commission fails to act within
13 60 days, the proposed acquisition shall be deemed approved by the city
14 planning commission and the matter shall be considered by the city
15 governing body.
16 A proposed conservation easement may be denied by the appropriate
17 city or county governing body upon a finding that the proposed
18 conservation easement is not in the public interest when the conservation
19 easement and is inconsistent with:
20 (1) The comprehensive plan for the area in force at the time of the
21 conveyance;
22 (2) any national, state, regional or local program furthering
