SENATE BILL No. 269
AN ACT concerning taxation; relating to income and privilege taxes; providing that future
tax rate decreases be contingent on exceeding revenue estimates and retaining a
certain amount in the budget stabilization fund; amending K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-
1107, 79-1108 and 79-32,110 and repealing the existing sections.
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
New Section 1. (a) As used in this section:
(1) "Adjusted consumer price ratio" means the fiscal year
consumer price index divided by the base year consumer price index.
(2) "Adjusted general revenue fund collections" means actual tax
receipt revenues to the state general fund from the Kansas income tax
act and the privilege tax imposed upon any national banking
association, state bank, trust company or savings and loan association
pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
and amendments thereto.
(3) "Base year revenues" means actual tax receipt revenues to the
state general fund for fiscal year 2024 in the amount of $5,969,395,529
from the Kansas income tax act and the privilege tax imposed upon any
national banking association, state bank, trust company or savings and
loan association pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas
Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
(4) "Base year consumer price index" means a 12-month average
of the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban
consumers for fiscal year 2024.
(5) "Excess fiscal year general revenue fund collections" means
the positive difference from subtracting the inflation adjusted base year
revenues from the adjusted general revenue fund collections from the
immediately preceding fiscal year.
(6) "Fiscal year consumer price index" means a 12-month average
of the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban
consumers for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
(7) "Inflation adjusted base year revenues" means the base year
revenues multiplied by the adjusted consumer price ratio.
(b) Commencing on August 15, 2025, and every August 15
thereafter, the director of the budget, in consultation with the director of
legislative research, shall determine whether the total fiscal year
adjusted general revenue fund collections from the immediately
preceding fiscal year are in excess of the inflation adjusted base year
revenues and if the amount of moneys in the budget stabilization fund
established pursuant to K.S.A. 75-6706, and amendments thereto, is
equal to or exceeds 15% of the prior fiscal year's state tax receipt
revenues to the state general fund. If the total fiscal year adjusted
general revenue fund collections from the immediately preceding fiscal
year are in excess of the inflation adjusted base year revenues and the
amount of moneys in the budget stabilization fund is equal to or
exceeds 15% of the prior fiscal year's state tax receipt revenues to the
state general fund, the director of the budget shall certify to the
secretary of revenue the existence of such excess and the amount of the
excess.
(c) In the event that the secretary of revenue certifies that the
adjusted general revenue fund collections from the immediately
preceding fiscal year are in excess of the inflation adjusted base year
revenues and the amount of moneys in the budget stabilization fund is
equal to or exceeds 15% of the prior fiscal year's state tax receipt
revenues to the state general fund, the secretary shall calculate and
publish the income tax and privilege tax rate reduction as a result of the
excess. In calculating the income tax rate reduction, the excess fiscal
year general revenue fund collections shall be computed that would
result in the reduction of the income tax rates pursuant to subsection (d)
in an amount approximately equal to the rate reductions down to the

SENATE BILL No. 269—page 2
nearest 0.01% to go into effect for the next tax year. In calculating the
privilege tax rate reduction pursuant to subsection (d), the reduction
shall be a corresponding rate reduction that is equal to the total
percentage adjustment to the corporate income tax. Such rate
reductions shall remain in effect unless further reduced pursuant to this
section. The income tax brackets and taxable income thresholds
prescribed in K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto, shall be
adjusted to reflect the changes in income tax rates.
(d) The secretary shall first compute the reduction of the income
tax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto, that
decreases proportionally all tax rates in effect. Once the lower income
tax rate is decreased to 4%, there shall be no further reductions to the
lower income tax rate and further reductions shall only be applied to
reduce the higher income tax rate in effect. Upon the higher income tax
rate being decreased to 4%, no further reductions shall occur to K.S.A.
79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto. The secretary shall then
compute decreases to:
(1) The surtax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and
amendments thereto. The surtax shall be decreased until the combined
normal and surtax rates equal 4% that are imposed pursuant to K.S.A.
79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto. Once the combined normal and
surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto,
equal 4%, no further reductions shall occur;
(2) the normal tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1107, and
amendments thereto. The normal tax shall be decreased until the
combined normal and surtax rates equal 2.6% that are imposed
pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1107, and amendments thereto. Once the
combined normal and surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1107, and
amendments thereto, equal 2.6%, no further reductions shall occur; and
(3) the normal tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1108, and
amendments thereto. The normal tax shall be decreased until the
combined normal and surtax rates equal 2.62% that are imposed
pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1108, and amendments thereto. Once the
combined normal and surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1108, and
amendments thereto, equal 2.62%, no further reductions shall occur.
Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-1107 is hereby amended to read as
follows: 79-1107. (a) Every national banking association and state bank
