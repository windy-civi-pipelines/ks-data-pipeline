SENATE BILL No. 58
By Committee on Agriculture and Natural Resources
1-22
1 AN ACT concerning water; relating to multi-year flex accounts; modifying
2 the requirements for and authorized allocations from such accounts;
3 amending K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 82a-736 and repealing the existing
4 section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 82a-736 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 82a-736. (a) It is hereby recognized that an opportunity exists The
9 chief engineer is authorized to establish multi-year flex accounts to
10 improve water management by enabling multi-year flexibility in the use of
11 water authorized to be diverted under a groundwater water right, provided
12 that if such flexibility neither impairs existing water rights, nor increases
13 the total amount of water diverted, so that such flexibility has no long-term
14 negative effect on the source of supply. It is therefore declared necessary
15 and advisable to permit the establishment of multi-year flex accounts for
16 groundwater water rights, together with commensurate protections for
17 existing water rights and their source of supply.
18 (b) As used in this section:
19 (1) "Alternative base average usage" means an allocation based on
20 net irrigation requirements calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(D)(ii)
21 that may be used in place of the base average usage.
22 (2) "Base water right" means a water right under which an applicant
23 applies to the chief engineer to establish a multi-year flex account and
24 where all of the following conditions exist that is vested or has been
25 issued a certificate of appropriation and:
26 (A) The water right's authorized source of supply is groundwater; and
27 (B) the water right is not currently the subject of to a multi-year
28 allocation due to a change approval that allows an expansion of the
29 authorized place of use pursuant to any other program or order issued by
30 the chief engineer;
31 (C) the water right is not subject to any order issued by the chief
32 engineer pursuant to K.S.A. 82a-703a, 82a-706b or 82a-717a, and
33 amendments thereto;
34 (D) neither the water right nor any portion thereof has been
35 deposited or placed in a safe deposit account in a chartered water bank;
36 (E) the water right is not deemed abandoned and is in compliance

SB 58 2
1 with all provisions of any order of the chief engineer; and
2 (F) the chief engineer determines that no other conditions exist that
3 make establishment of a multi-year flex account for such water right
4 contrary to the public interest.
5 (3)(2) "Multi-year flex account" means a term permit for up to five
6 years that suspends a base water right during its term, except when the
7 term permit may be no longer exercised because of an order of the chief
8 engineer, and is subject to the terms and conditions as provided in
9 subsection (e).
10 (4) "Base average usage" means:
11 (A) The average amount of water actually diverted for the authorized
12 beneficial use under the base water right during calendar years 2000
13 through 2009, excluding:
14 (i) Any amount diverted in any such year that exceeded the amount
15 authorized by the base water right;
16 (ii) any amount applied to an unauthorized place of use; and
17 (iii) diversions in calendar years when water was diverted under a
18 multi-year allocation with an expansion of the authorized place of use due
19 to a change approval;
20 (B) if water use records are inadequate to accurately determine actual
21 water use or upon demonstration of good cause by the applicant, the chief
22 engineer may calculate the base average usage with less than all 10
23 calendar years during 2000 and 2009. In no case shall the base average
24 usage be calculated with less than five calendar years during 2000 and
25 2009; or
26 (C) if the holder of the base water right shows to the satisfaction of
27 the chief engineer that water conservation reduced water use under the
28 base water right during calendar years 2000 through 2009, then the base
29 average usage shall be calculated with the five calendar years immediately
30 before the calendar year when water conservation began.
31 (5) "Chief engineer" means the chief engineer of the division of water
32 resources of the department of agriculture.
33 (6) "Flex account acreage" means the maximum number of acres
34 lawfully irrigated during a calendar year, except for any acres irrigated

38 (A) The calendar year is 2000 through 2009;
39 (B) if water conservation reduced water use under the base water
40 right during calendar years 2000 through 2009, the calendar year is a year
41 within the five calendar years immediately prior to the calendar year when
42 water conservation began; or
43 (C) if an application to appropriate water was approved after

SB 58 3
1 December 31, 2004, the calendar year is any during the perfection period

13 base water right may establish a multi-year flex account where the holder
14 may deposit, in advance, the authorized quantity of water from such a
15 base water right for any in advance for a period of up to five consecutive
16 calendar years, except when the chief engineer determines a shorter period
17 is necessary for compliance with a local enhanced management area or an

3 (E) if the multi-year flex account is approved for less than five
4 calendar years, the amount of water deposited in the multi-year flex
5 account shall be prorated based on the number of calendar years approved
6 and otherwise calculated as required by subsection (c)(1)(D)(i), (ii) or (iii);
7 and
8 (F) any deposited water remaining in a multi-year flex account up to

9 section shall authorize impairment of any vested right or prior
10 appropriation right by the exercise of such term permit.
11 (f) An(2) for each multi-year flex account that overlaps in place of
12 use with other water rights, including other multi-year flex accounts or
13 other term permits, the multi-year flex account's authorized quantity shall
14 be further limited by the net irrigation requirement for the common place
15 of use when combined with the quantities authorized by the overlapping

18 for each point of diversion authorized by the base water right;
19 (4) the authorized rate of diversion of each multi-year flex account
20 shall be the maximum authorized rate of diversion for the point of
21 diversion authorized by the base water right; and
22 (5) the authorized point of diversion and place of use shall be the
23 point of diversion and place of use for the base water right. Any approval
24 of an application to change the point of diversion or place of use of the
25 base water right shall automatically result in a change to the point of
26 diversion or place of use for the multi-year flex account.
27 (d) Each application for a multi-year flex account shall be filed with
28 the chief engineer on or before December 31 of the first year of the multi-
29 year flex account term for which the application is being made. Such
30 application shall be subject to the same fee required for other term permits
31 pursuant to K.S.A. 82a-708c, and amendments thereto.
32 (e) If there is deposited water remaining in a multi-year flex account
33 upon the expiration of such account's term, an amount of water not to
34 exceed the lesser of the annual net irrigation requirement for the base
35 water right's authorized acres or the base water right's authorized annual
36 quantity may be added to the deposit amount determined in paragraph (c)
37 (1) for a subsequent multi-year flex account term if such addition does not
38 result in the multi-year allocation for the subsequent multi-year flex
39 account term exceeding the base water right's authorized annual quantity
40 multiplied by the number of years of the subsequent multi-year flex
41 account term and the base water right is enrolled in the subsequent multi-
42 year flex account during the calendar year in which the existing multi-
43 year flex account term expires.

SB 58 6
