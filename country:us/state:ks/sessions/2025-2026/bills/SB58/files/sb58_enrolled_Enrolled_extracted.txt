Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 82a-736 is hereby amended to read
as follows: 82a-736. (a) It is hereby recognized that an opportunity
exists The chief engineer is authorized to establish multi-year flex
accounts to improve water management by enabling multi-year
flexibility in the use of water authorized to be diverted under a
groundwater water right, provided that if such flexibility neither
impairs existing water rights, nor increases the total amount of water
diverted, so that such flexibility has no long-term negative effect on the
source of supply. It is therefore declared necessary and advisable to
permit the establishment of multi-year flex accounts for groundwater
water rights, together with commensurate protections for existing water
rights and their source of supply.
(b) As used in this section:
(1) "Alternative base average usage" means an allocation based on
net irrigation requirements calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(D)
(ii) that may be used in place of the base average usage.
(2) "Base water right" means a water right under which an
applicant applies to the chief engineer to establish a multi-year flex
account and where all of the following conditions exist that is vested or
has been issued a certificate of appropriation and:
(A) The water right's authorized source of supply is groundwater;
and

engineer pursuant to K.S.A. 82a-703a, 82a-706b or 82a-717a, and
amendments thereto;
(D) neither the water right nor any portion thereof has been
deposited or placed in a safe deposit account in a chartered water
bank;
(E) the water right is not deemed abandoned and is in compliance
with all provisions of any order of the chief engineer; and
(F) the chief engineer determines that no other conditions exist
that make establishment of a multi-year flex account for such water
right contrary to the public interest.
(3)(2) "Multi-year flex account" means a term permit for up to
five years that suspends a base water right during its term, except when
the term permit may be no longer exercised because of an order of the
chief engineer, and is subject to the terms and conditions as provided in
subsection (e).

(A) The average amount of water actually diverted for the
authorized beneficial use under the base water right during calendar
years 2000 through 2009, excluding:
(i) Any amount diverted in any such year that exceeded the
amount authorized by the base water right;
(ii) any amount applied to an unauthorized place of use; and
(iii) diversions in calendar years when water was diverted under a
multi-year allocation with an expansion of the authorized place of use
due to a change approval;
(B) if water use records are inadequate to accurately determine
actual water use or upon demonstration of good cause by the applicant,
the chief engineer may calculate the base average usage with less than
SENATE BILL No. 58—page 2
all 10 calendar years during 2000 and 2009. In no case shall the base
average usage be calculated with less than five calendar years during
2000 and 2009; or
(C) if the holder of the base water right shows to the satisfaction
of the chief engineer that water conservation reduced water use under
the base water right during calendar years 2000 through 2009, then the
