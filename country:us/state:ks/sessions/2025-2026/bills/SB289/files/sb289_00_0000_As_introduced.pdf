7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 66-101j is hereby amended to read as
9 follows: 66-101j. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 66-101b or
10 66-109, and amendments thereto, the commission shall authorize an
11 electric public utility to implement economic development rate schedules
12 that provide discounts from otherwise applicable standard rates for electric
13 service for new or expanded facilities of industrial or commercial
14 customers that are not in the business of selling or providing goods or
15 services directly to the general public. To be eligible for such discounts,
16 such customer shall:
17 (1) Have incentives from one or more local, regional, state or federal
18 economic development agencies to locate such new or expanded facilities
19 in the electric public utility's certified service territory;
20 (2) qualify for service under the electric public utility's non-
21 residential and non-lighting rate schedules for such new or expanded
22 facility; and
23 (3) not receive the discount together with service provided by the
24 electric public utility pursuant to any other special contract agreements.
25 (b) The discount authorized by this section shall only be applicable to
26 new facilities or expanded facilities that have:
27 (1) A peak demand that is reasonably projected to be at least 200
28 kilowatts within two years of the date the customer first receives service
29 under the discounted rate and is not the result of shifting existing demand
30 from other facilities of the customer in the electric public utility's certified
31 service territory and:
32 (A) Has an annual load factor that is reasonably projected to equal or
33 exceed the electric public utility's annual system load factor within two
34 years of the date that the customer first receives service under the
35 discounted rate; or
36 (B) otherwise warrants a discounted rate based on any of the

SB 289 2
1 following factors:
2 (i) The number of new permanent full-time jobs created or the
3 percentage increase in existing permanent full-time jobs created;
4 (ii) the level of capital investment;
5 (iii) additional off-peak usage;
6 (iv) curtailable or interruptible load;
7 (v) new industry or technology; or
8 (vi) competition with existing industrial customers;
9 (2) a peak demand that is reasonably projected to be at least 300
10 kilowatts within two years of the date that the customer first receives
11 service under the discounted rate and is not the result of shifting existing
12 demand from other facilities of the customer in the electric public utility's
13 certified service territory and:
14 (A) An annual load factor that is reasonably projected to be at least
15 55% within two years of the date that the customer first receives service
16 under the discounted rate; and
17 (B) the facility shall, once first achieved, maintain the peak demand
18 and load factor for the remaining duration of the discounted rate; or
19 (3) a peak demand that is reasonably projected to be at least 25
20 megawatts within two years of the date that the customer first receives
21 service under the discounted rate and is not the result of shifting existing
22 demand from other facilities of the customer in the electric public utility's
23 certified service territory and:
24 (A) An annual load factor that is reasonably projected to be at least
25 55% within two years of the date that the customer first receives service
26 under the discounted rate; and
27 (B) the facility shall, once first achieved, maintain the peak demand
28 and load factor for the remaining duration of the discounted rate.
29 (c) The discount authorized by this section shall be determined by
30 reducing otherwise applicable charges associated with the rate schedule
31 applicable to the new or expanded existing facility by a fixed percentage
32 for each year of service under the discount for a period of up to:
33 (1) Five years to facilities that qualify pursuant to subsection (b)(1) or
34 (b)(2); and
35 (2) 10 years to facilities that qualify pursuant to subsection (b)(3).
36 (d) (1) For discounts to facilities that qualify pursuant to subsection
37 (b)(1), the average of the annual discount percentages shall not exceed
38 20%, except that such discounts may be between 5% to and 30% in any
39 year of such five-year period.
40 (2) For discounts to facilities that qualify pursuant to subsection (b)
41 (2), the average of the annual discount percentages shall not exceed 40%,
42 except that such discounts may be between 20% and 50% in any year of
43 such five-year period.

SB 289 3
1 (3) For discounts to facilities that qualify pursuant to subsection (b)
2 (3), the average of the annual discount percentages shall not exceed:
3 (A) For the first five years of the discount period, 40%, except that
4 such discounts may be between 20% to and 50% in any year of such five-
5 year period; and
6 (B) for the final five years of the discount period, 20%, except that
7 such discounts may be between 10% and 30% in any year of such five-
8 year period.
9 (e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), on and after July 1, 2024,
10 the difference in revenues generated by applying the discounted rates
11 authorized pursuant to this section and the revenues that would have been
12 generated without such discounts shall not be imputed into the electric
13 public utility's revenue requirement.
14 (2) Any reduction in revenue resulting from any discount provided
15 pursuant to this section that was tracked by the public utility and deferred
16 to a regulatory asset prior to July 1, 2024, shall be recoverable in any
17 general rate proceeding initiated on or after July 1, 2024, through an equal
18 percentage adjustment to the revenue requirement responsibility for all
19 customer classes of the public utility, including the customer classes that
20 include customers qualifying for discounts pursuant to this section.
21 (f) On and after July 1, 2025, the commission shall not authorize an
22 electric public utility to commence implementation of a discounted electric
23 development rate pursuant to this section for any new or expanded facility
24 of an industrial or commercial customer unless such discounted rate is
25 sufficient to cover the incremental and variable cost to serve such
26 customer. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect or limit
27 any discounted electric development rate that was first implemented prior
28 to July 1, 2025.
29 (g) The provisions of this section shall not apply to rates for service
30 provided to customers under contract rates approved by the commission
31 pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 66-101i, and amendments thereto, or the
32 commission's general ratemaking authority according to custom and
33 practice of the commission in place prior to the effective date of this
34 section.
35 (g)(h) Starting in January 2023, the commission shall biennially
36 provide a status report to the legislature about any discounts from tariffed
37 rates authorized pursuant to this section. Such report shall include the:
38 (1) Number of entities with such discounts;
39 (2) number of entities with increased load;
40 (3) number of entities with decreased load;
41 (4) aggregate load and change in aggregate load on an annual basis;
42 (5) total subsidy and the subsidy for each individual contract;
43 (6) annual and cumulative rate impact on non-contract rate

SB 289 4
1 customers; and
2 (7) estimated economic development impact of entities with
3 discounted rates that occurred as a result of such discounts through an
4 evaluation of the annual: (A) Total employment for such entities; (B)
5 change in employment for such entities; and (C) tax revenue generated by
6 such entities.
7 (h)(i) An electric public utility shall be authorized to only implement
8 discounted rates for facilities that qualify for such discounted rates
9 pursuant to subsection (b)(3) until December 31, 2030, except that, upon
10 application by such public utility, the commission may authorize the public
11 utility to continue to implement such discounted rates for facilities that
12 qualify for such discounted rates pursuant to subsection (b)(3) until
13 December 31, 2036. Any such application shall be filed with the
14 commission on or before December 31, 2028. The commission shall issue
15 a determination on an application filed pursuant to this subsection within
16 240 days of the date that such application is filed. If requested by the
17 public utility, an intervenor in the application docket or commission staff,
18 the commission shall hold a hearing on such application. When
19 considering and making a determination upon such application, the
20 commission may consider factors that the commission deems just and
21 reasonable and condition the commission's determination on any factors
22 that are relevant to the discounted rates for facilities that qualify for such
23 discounted rates pursuant to subsection (b)(3). If the commission denies
24 the public utility's application, such denial shall only act to prohibit the
25 public utility from implementing discounted rates for facilities that qualify
26 for such discounted rates pursuant to subsection (b)(3) after December 31,
27 2030, and shall not otherwise affect or terminate any discounted rates
28 implemented by the public utility pursuant to this section or any regulatory
29 or ratemaking treatment of such discounted rates.
30 (i)(j) For the purposes of this section:
31 (1) "Electric public utility" means the same as defined in K.S.A. 66-
32 101a, and amendments thereto, but does not include any such utility that is
33 a cooperative as defined in K.S.A. 66-104d, and amendments thereto, or
34 owned by one or more such cooperatives;
35 (2) "expanded facility" means a separately metered facility of the
36 customer, unless the utility determines that the additional costs of separate
37 metering of such facility would exceed the associated benefits or that it
38 would be difficult or impractical to install or read the meter, that has not
39 received service in the electric utility's certified service territory in the
40 previous 12 months; and
41 (3) "new facility" means a building of the customer that has not
42 received electric service in the electric utility's certified service territory in
43 the previous 12 months.

SB 289 5
