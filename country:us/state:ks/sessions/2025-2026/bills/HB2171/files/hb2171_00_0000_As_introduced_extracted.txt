10 natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness";
11 and
12 WHEREAS, This provision declaring an inalienable and equal right to
13 life has been turned on its head by the erroneous interpretation of the
14 Supreme Court of this state, which held in 2019 that the provision protects
15 a woman's "right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy." Hodes &
16 Nauser, MDS, P.A. v. Schmidt, 309 Kan. 610 (2019); and
17 WHEREAS, Such an interpretation—finding a right to commit prenatal

20 Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which requires that
21 "[n]o state…shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
22 protection of the laws"; and
23 WHEREAS, The Constitution of the United States provides, "This

26 in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
27 Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." Art. VI, Clause 2; and
28 WHEREAS, Innocent human life, created in the image of God, should
29 therefore be equally protected under the laws from fertilization through
30 natural death; and
31 WHEREAS, To ensure the right to life and equal protection of the laws,
32 all preborn children should be protected with the same criminal and civil
33 laws protecting the lives of born persons by repealing provisions that
34 permit prenatal homicide and battery; and
35 WHEREAS, All persons potentially subject to such laws are entitled to
36 due process protections; and
HB 2171 2
1 WHEREAS, Pregnant mothers should be protected from being
2 pressured to abort their children; and
3 WHEREAS, Provisions that may allow a person to aid, advise, hire,
4 counsel or procure a mother to abort her child should be repealed.
