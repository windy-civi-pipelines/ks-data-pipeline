HOUSE BILL No. 2166
AN ACT concerning the open records act; relating to public records; continuing in
existence certain exceptions to the disclosure thereof; amending K.S.A. 65-7616 and
K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-229 and 48-962 and repealing the existing sections; also
repealing K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-229d.
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-229 is hereby amended to read as
follows: 45-229. (a) It is the intent of the legislature that exceptions to
disclosure under the open records act shall be created or maintained
only if:
(1) The public record is of a sensitive or personal nature
concerning individuals;
(2) the public record is necessary for the effective and efficient
administration of a governmental program; or
(3) the public record affects confidential information.
The maintenance or creation of an exception to disclosure must be
compelled as measured by these criteria. Further, the legislature finds
that the public has a right to have access to public records unless the
criteria in this section for restricting such access to a public record are
met and the criteria are considered during legislative review in
connection with the particular exception to disclosure to be significant
enough to override the strong public policy of open government. To
strengthen the policy of open government, the legislature shall consider
the criteria in this section before enacting an exception to disclosure.
(b) Subject to the provisions of subsections (g) and (h), any new
exception to disclosure or substantial amendment of an existing
exception shall expire on July 1 of the fifth year after enactment of the
new exception or substantial amendment, unless the legislature acts to
continue the exception. A law that enacts a new exception or
substantially amends an existing exception shall state that the exception
expires at the end of five years and that the exception shall be reviewed
by the legislature before the scheduled date.
(c) For purposes of this section, an exception is substantially
amended if the amendment expands the scope of the exception to
include more records or information. An exception is not substantially
amended if the amendment narrows the scope of the exception.
(d) This section is not intended to repeal an exception that has
been amended following legislative review before the scheduled repeal
of the exception if the exception is not substantially amended as a result
of the review.
(e) In the year before the expiration of an exception, the revisor of
statutes shall certify to the president of the senate and the speaker of the
house of representatives, by July 15, the language and statutory citation
of each exception that will expire in the following year that meets the
criteria of an exception as defined in this section. Any exception that is
not identified and certified to the president of the senate and the
speaker of the house of representatives is not subject to legislative
review and shall not expire. If the revisor of statutes fails to certify an
exception that the revisor subsequently determines should have been
certified, the revisor shall include the exception in the following year's
certification after that determination.
(f) "Exception" means any provision of law that creates an
exception to disclosure or limits disclosure under the open records act
pursuant to K.S.A. 45-221, and amendments thereto, or pursuant to any
other provision of law.
(g) A provision of law that creates or amends an exception to
disclosure under the open records law shall not be subject to review and
expiration under this act if such provision:
(1) Is required by federal law;
(2) applies solely to the legislature or to the state court system;
(3) has been reviewed and continued in existence twice by the
legislature;
(4) has been reviewed and continued in existence by the
legislature during the 2013 legislative session and thereafter; or
(5) is a report of the results of an audit conducted by the United

HOUSE BILL No. 2166—page 2
States cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency.
(h) (1) The legislature shall review the exception before its
scheduled expiration and consider as part of the review process the
following:
(A) What specific records are affected by the exception;
(B) whom does the exception uniquely affect, as opposed to the
general public;
(C) what is the identifiable public purpose or goal of the
exception;
(D) whether the information contained in the records may be
obtained readily by alternative means and how it may be obtained;
(2) an exception may be created or maintained only if it serves an
identifiable public purpose and may be no broader than is necessary to
meet the public purpose it serves. An identifiable public purpose is
served if the legislature finds that the purpose is sufficiently compelling
to override the strong public policy of open government and cannot be
accomplished without the exception and if the exception:
(A) Allows the effective and efficient administration of a
governmental program that would be significantly impaired without the
exception;
(B) protects information of a sensitive personal nature concerning
individuals, the release of such information would be defamatory to
such individuals or cause unwarranted damage to the good name or
reputation of such individuals or would jeopardize the safety of such
individuals. Only information that would identify the individuals may
be excepted under this paragraph; or
(C) protects information of a confidential nature concerning
entities, including, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, device,
combination of devices, or compilation of information that is used to
protect or further a business advantage over those who do not know or
use it, if the disclosure of such information would injure the affected
entity in the marketplace.
(3) Records made before the date of the expiration of an exception
shall be subject to disclosure as otherwise provided by law. In deciding
whether the records shall be made public, the legislature shall consider
whether the damage or loss to persons or entities uniquely affected by
the exception of the type specified in paragraph (2)(B) or (2)(C) would
occur if the records were made public.
(i) (1) Exceptions contained in the following statutes as continued
in existence in section 2 of chapter 126 of the 2005 Session Laws of
Kansas and that have been reviewed and continued in existence twice
by the legislature as provided in subsection (g) are hereby continued in
existence: 1-401, 2-1202, 5-512, 9-1137, 9-1712, 9-2217, 10-630, 12-
