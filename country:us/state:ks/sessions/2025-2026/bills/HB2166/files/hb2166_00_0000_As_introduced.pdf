Session of 2025
HOUSE BILL No. 2166
By Committee on Judiciary
Requested by Representative Humphries on behalf of the Office of Revisor of
Statutes pursuant to K.S.A. 45-229
1-30
1 AN ACT concerning the open records act; relating to public records;
2 continuing in existence certain exceptions to the disclosure thereof;
3 amending K.S.A. 65-7616 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-229 and 48-962
4 and repealing the existing sections; also repealing K.S.A. 2024 Supp.
5 45-229d.
6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-229 is hereby amended to read as
9 follows: 45-229. (a) It is the intent of the legislature that exceptions to
10 disclosure under the open records act shall be created or maintained only
11 if:
12 (1) The public record is of a sensitive or personal nature concerning
13 individuals;
14 (2) the public record is necessary for the effective and efficient
15 administration of a governmental program; or
16 (3) the public record affects confidential information.
17 The maintenance or creation of an exception to disclosure must be
18 compelled as measured by these criteria. Further, the legislature finds that
19 the public has a right to have access to public records unless the criteria in
20 this section for restricting such access to a public record are met and the
21 criteria are considered during legislative review in connection with the
22 particular exception to disclosure to be significant enough to override the
23 strong public policy of open government. To strengthen the policy of open
24 government, the legislature shall consider the criteria in this section before
25 enacting an exception to disclosure.
26 (b) Subject to the provisions of subsections (g) and (h), any new
27 exception to disclosure or substantial amendment of an existing exception
28 shall expire on July 1 of the fifth year after enactment of the new
29 exception or substantial amendment, unless the legislature acts to continue
30 the exception. A law that enacts a new exception or substantially amends
31 an existing exception shall state that the exception expires at the end of
32 five years and that the exception shall be reviewed by the legislature
33 before the scheduled date.
34 (c) For purposes of this section, an exception is substantially

HB 2166 2
1 amended if the amendment expands the scope of the exception to include
2 more records or information. An exception is not substantially amended if
3 the amendment narrows the scope of the exception.
4 (d) This section is not intended to repeal an exception that has been
5 amended following legislative review before the scheduled repeal of the
6 exception if the exception is not substantially amended as a result of the
7 review.
8 (e) In the year before the expiration of an exception, the revisor of
9 statutes shall certify to the president of the senate and the speaker of the
10 house of representatives, by July 15, the language and statutory citation of
11 each exception that will expire in the following year that meets the criteria
12 of an exception as defined in this section. Any exception that is not
13 identified and certified to the president of the senate and the speaker of the
14 house of representatives is not subject to legislative review and shall not
15 expire. If the revisor of statutes fails to certify an exception that the revisor
16 subsequently determines should have been certified, the revisor shall
17 include the exception in the following year's certification after that
18 determination.
19 (f) "Exception" means any provision of law that creates an exception
20 to disclosure or limits disclosure under the open records act pursuant to
21 K.S.A. 45-221, and amendments thereto, or pursuant to any other
22 provision of law.
23 (g) A provision of law that creates or amends an exception to
24 disclosure under the open records law shall not be subject to review and
25 expiration under this act if such provision:
26 (1) Is required by federal law;
27 (2) applies solely to the legislature or to the state court system;
28 (3) has been reviewed and continued in existence twice by the
29 legislature;
30 (4) has been reviewed and continued in existence by the legislature
31 during the 2013 legislative session and thereafter; or
32 (5) is a report of the results of an audit conducted by the United
33 States cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency.
34 (h) (1) The legislature shall review the exception before its scheduled
35 expiration and consider as part of the review process the following:
36 (A) What specific records are affected by the exception;
37 (B) whom does the exception uniquely affect, as opposed to the
38 general public;
39 (C) what is the identifiable public purpose or goal of the exception;
40 (D) whether the information contained in the records may be obtained
41 readily by alternative means and how it may be obtained;
42 (2) an exception may be created or maintained only if it serves an
43 identifiable public purpose and may be no broader than is necessary to

HB 2166 3
1 meet the public purpose it serves. An identifiable public purpose is served
2 if the legislature finds that the purpose is sufficiently compelling to
3 override the strong public policy of open government and cannot be
4 accomplished without the exception and if the exception:
5 (A) Allows the effective and efficient administration of a
6 governmental program that would be significantly impaired without the
7 exception;
8 (B) protects information of a sensitive personal nature concerning
9 individuals, the release of such information would be defamatory to such
10 individuals or cause unwarranted damage to the good name or reputation
11 of such individuals or would jeopardize the safety of such individuals.
12 Only information that would identify the individuals may be excepted
13 under this paragraph; or
14 (C) protects information of a confidential nature concerning entities,
15 including, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, device, combination of
16 devices, or compilation of information that is used to protect or further a
17 business advantage over those who do not know or use it, if the disclosure
18 of such information would injure the affected entity in the marketplace.
19 (3) Records made before the date of the expiration of an exception
20 shall be subject to disclosure as otherwise provided by law. In deciding
21 whether the records shall be made public, the legislature shall consider
22 whether the damage or loss to persons or entities uniquely affected by the
23 exception of the type specified in paragraph (2)(B) or (2)(C) would occur
24 if the records were made public.
25 (i) (1) Exceptions contained in the following statutes as continued in
26 existence in section 2 of chapter 126 of the 2005 Session Laws of Kansas
27 and that have been reviewed and continued in existence twice by the
