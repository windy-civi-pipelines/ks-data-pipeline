outside the boundaries of such land; and saving further to said state the
right to tax the property and franchises of any railroad, bridge or other

metes and bounds description of the boundary of concurrent
jurisdiction with the secretary of state who shall publish such
information in the Kansas register.
(2) After concurrent jurisdiction is effective:
