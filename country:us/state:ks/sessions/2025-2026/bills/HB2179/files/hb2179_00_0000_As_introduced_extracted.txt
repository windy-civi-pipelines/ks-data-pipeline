26 according to generally accepted medical practices.

27 amendments thereto, has assessed the juvenile as detention-eligible or
28 there are grounds to override the results of a detention risk assessment tool
29 and the court finds probable cause that:
30 (1) Community-based alternatives to detention are insufficient to:

21 protocol allows such placement.
22 (d) No person 18 years of age or more shall be placed in a juvenile
23 detention center.
24 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 38-2346 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
25 2346. (a) Each director of juvenile intake and assessment services in
26 collaboration with the county or district attorney shall adopt a policy and
27 establish guidelines for an immediate intervention process by which a
28 juvenile may avoid prosecution. The guidelines may include information

12 K.S.A. 21-5507, and amendments thereto, the juvenile has no prior
13 adjudications, and the offer is made pursuant to the guidelines developed
14 pursuant to this section. Participation in an immediate intervention
15 program is not required to be offered to a juvenile who was originally
16 charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute
17 a felony and, as a result of a plea agreement reached between the juvenile
18 and prosecuting attorney, the charge has been amended to a misdemeanor.
19 A juvenile who has participated in an immediate intervention program for
20 a previous misdemeanor may, but is not required to, be offered
21 participation in an immediate intervention program.

30 be supervised or unsupervised by any of the aforementioned entities. The
31 county or district attorneys office shall not be required to supervise
32 juveniles participating in an immediate intervention program.

36 extends beyond the six-month period. In such case, the plan may be
37 extended up to two additional months.
38 (5) If the juvenile satisfactorily complies with the immediate
39 intervention plan, such juvenile shall be discharged and the charges
40 dismissed at the end of the time period specified in paragraph (4).

15 intervention or whether alternative means of adjudication should be
16 designated pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2389, and amendments thereto. The
17 county or district attorney shall consider any recommendation of a juvenile
18 intake and assessment worker, court services officer or community
19 corrections officer.
20 (e) "Summons" means a written order issued by an intake and
21 assessment worker or a law enforcement officer directing that a juvenile
22 appear before a designated court at a stated time and place to answer a
23 pending charge.
24 (f) A juvenile who is eligible for an immediate intervention shall not
25 be denied participation in such a program or terminated unsuccessfully due
26 to an inability to pay fees or other associated costs. Fees assessed from
27 such a program shall be retained by the program and shall not be used for
28 any purpose, except development and operation of the program No fees
29 or costs shall be imposed on a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or
30 custodian for participation in an immediate intervention program. A
31 juvenile who is otherwise eligible to participate in an immediate
32 intervention program shall not be denied access to such program due to
33 unpaid fees or costs.
34 (g) If a juvenile substantially complies with an immediate
35 intervention program, charges in such juvenile's case shall not be filed.
36 (h) The policies and guidelines developed pursuant to subsection (a)
37 shall adhere to standards and procedures for immediate intervention

41 immediate intervention program when the county or district attorney has
42 declined to continue with prosecution of an alleged offense.
43 Sec. 17. K.S.A. 38-2348 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
HB 2179 25
1 2348. (a) (1) For the purpose of this section, a person charged as a juvenile
2 is incompetent for adjudication as a juvenile offender if, because of mental
3 illness or defect, such person is unable to:
4 (1)(A) Understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings; or
5 (2)(B) make or assist in making a defense.
6 (2) Whenever the words "competent," "competency," "incompetent"
7 and "incompetency" are used without qualification in this code, such
8 words shall refer to the standard for incompetency described in this
9 subsection.
10 (b) (1) If at any time after such person has been charged as a juvenile
11 there is reason to believe that the juvenile is incompetent for adjudication
12 as a juvenile offender, the proceedings shall be suspended and the court
13 before whom the case is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the
14 competency of the juvenile. Such a hearing may be held upon the motion
15 of the juvenile's attorney or the prosecuting attorney, or upon the court's
16 own motion.
17 (2) The court shall determine the issue of competency. To facilitate in
18 this determination, the court may: (A) Appoint a licensed psychiatrist or
19 psychologist to examine the juvenile; or (B) designate a private or public
20 mental health facility to conduct a psychiatric or psychological
21 examination and report to the court. If the examining psychiatrist,
22 psychologist or private or public mental health facility determines that
23 further examination is necessary, the court may commit the juvenile for not
24 more than 60 days to any appropriate public or private institution for
25 examination and report to the court. For good cause shown, the
26 commitment may be extended for another 60 days. No statement made by
27 the juvenile in the course of any examination provided for by this section,
28 whether the examination is with or without the consent of the juvenile,
29 shall be admitted in evidence against the juvenile in any hearing.
30 (3) Unless the court finds the attendance of the juvenile would be
31 injurious to the juvenile's health, the juvenile shall be present personally at
32 all proceedings under this section.
33 (c) If the juvenile is found to be competent, the proceedings which
34 have been suspended shall be resumed.
35 (d) If the juvenile is found to be incompetent, the juvenile shall
36 remain subject to the jurisdiction of the court and shall be committed for
37 evaluation and treatment pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2349 and 38-2350, and
38 amendments thereto. One or both parents of the juvenile may be ordered to
39 pay child support pursuant to the Kansas child support guidelines. Upon
40 application of the juvenile and in the discretion of the court, the juvenile
41 may be released to any appropriate private institution upon terms and
42 conditions prescribed by the court.
43 (e) If at any time after proceedings have been suspended under this
HB 2179 26
1 section, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a juvenile who has
2 been adjudged incompetent is now competent, the court in which the case
3 is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the juvenile's present
4 mental condition. Reasonable notice of the hearings shall be given to the
5 prosecuting attorney, the juvenile and the juvenile's attorney of record, if
6 any. If the court, following the hearing, finds the juvenile to be competent,
7 the pending proceedings shall be resumed.
8 Sec. 18. K.S.A. 38-2360 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
9 2360. (a) At any time after the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a
10 juvenile offender, the court shall order one or more of the tools described
11 in this subsection to be submitted to assist the court unless the court finds
12 that adequate and current information from a risk and needs assessment is
13 available from a previous investigation, report or other sources:
14 (1) An evaluation and written report by a mental health or a qualified
15 professional stating the psychological or emotional development or needs
16 of the juvenile. The court also may order a report from any mental health
17 or qualified professional who has previously evaluated the juvenile stating
18 the psychological or emotional development needs of the juvenile. If the
19 court orders an evaluation as provided in this section, a parent of the
20 juvenile shall have the right to obtain an independent evaluation at the
21 expense of no cost to the parent. If the evaluation indicates that the
22 juvenile requires acute inpatient mental health or substance abuse
23 treatment, the court shall have the authority to compel an assessment by
24 the secretary for aging and disability services. The court may use the
25 results to inform a treatment and payment plan according to the same
26 eligibility process used for non-court-involved youth. No juvenile or
27 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian shall be required to pay for
28 treatment ordered by the court pursuant to this section.
29 (2) A report of the medical condition and needs of the juvenile. The
30 court also may order a report from any physician who has been attending
31 the juvenile, stating the diagnosis, condition and treatment afforded the
32 juvenile.
33 (3) An educational needs assessment of the juvenile from the chief
34 administrative officer of the school which the juvenile attends or attended

39 juvenile's teacher or teachers; (C) the school psychologist; (D) a school
40 special services representative; (E) a representative of the commissioner;

7 by law, all local governmental public and private educational institutions
8 and state agencies shall furnish to the officer conducting the
9 predispositional investigation the records the officer requests.
10 Predispositional investigations shall contain other information prescribed
11 by the court.
12 (5) The court in its discretion may direct that the parents submit a
13 domestic relations affidavit.
14 (b) A summary of the results from a risk and needs assessment shall
15 be provided to the court post-adjudication, predisposition and used to
16 inform supervision levels. A single, uniform risk and needs assessment
17 shall be adopted by the office of judicial administration and the department
18 of corrections to be used in all judicial districts. The office of judicial
19 administration and the secretary of corrections shall establish cutoff scores
20 determining risk levels of juveniles. Training on such risk and needs
21 assessment shall be required for all administrators of the assessment. Data
22 shall be collected on the results of the assessment to inform a validation
23 study on the Kansas juvenile justice population to be conducted by June
24 30, 2020.
25 (c) Expenses and fees for post adjudication post-adjudication tools
26 may be waived or, including the fees described in subsections (a)(1)
27 through (a)(4), shall not be assessed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2314(c)(2), and
28 amendments thereto against a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or
29 custodian.
30 (d) Except as otherwise prohibited by law or policy, the court shall
31 make any of the reports ordered pursuant to subsection (a) available to the
32 attorneys and shall allow the attorneys a reasonable time to review the
33 report before ordering the sentencing of the juvenile offender.
34 (e) At any time prior to sentencing, the judge, at the request of a
35 party, shall hear additional evidence as to proposals for reasonable and
36 appropriate sentencing of the case.
37 (f) If a juvenile is being held in detention, a dispositional hearing to
38 sentence the juvenile offender shall take place within 45 days after such
39 juvenile offender has been adjudicated.

41 2361. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-

27 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
28 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
29 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
30 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
31 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
32 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
33 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
34 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
35 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
36 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
37 the fee. In no event shall The fee shall not be assessed against the secretary
38 of corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be
39 assessed against the secretary of the department for children and families
40 or the Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
41 secretary's care, custody and control. The court shall not assess any fee for
42 the evaluation or program, including, but not limited to, any ongoing
43 required drug or alcohol testing, against the juvenile, the juvenile's parent,
HB 2179 31
1 guardian or custodian.
2 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
3 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
4 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
5 provisions apply:
6 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
7 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
8 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
9 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
10 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
11 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
12 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
13 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
14 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
15 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
16 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
17 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
18 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
19 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
20 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
21 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
22 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
23 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
24 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
25 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
26 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
27 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
28 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
29 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
30 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
31 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
32 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
33 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
34 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
35 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
36 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
37 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
38 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
39 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
40 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
41 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
42 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
43 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
HB 2179 32
1 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
2 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
3 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
4 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
5 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
6 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
7 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
8 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
9 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
10 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
11 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
12 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
13 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
14 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
15 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
16 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
17 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
18 conditions.
19 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
20 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
21 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
22 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
23 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
24 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
25 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
26 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
27 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
28 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
29 organizations performing services for the community; and
30 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
31 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
32 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
33 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
34 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
35 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
36 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
37 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
38 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
39 following provisions apply:
40 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
41 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
42 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
43 lump sum or installments;
HB 2179 33
1 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
2 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
3 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
4 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
5 imposition of a fine; and
6 (3) any fine imposed by court shall be a judgment against the juvenile
7 that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other execution as on
8 judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the
9 termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
10 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
11 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
12 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
13 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
14 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
15 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
16 (g)(f) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
17 subsection (a)(11) (a)(9), the following provisions shall apply:
18 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
19 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
20 exhausted. The court shall not order commitment to detention for
21 nonpayment of any fine, fee cost or restitution, including in cases where
22 nonpayment constitutes a violation of sentencing conditions.
23 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
24 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
25 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
26 new felony offense, or violates conditional release. No such finding shall
27 be based in whole or in part on:
28 (A) Nonpayment of fines, fees, costs or other financial obligations by
29 the juvenile, the juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian; or
30 (B) a juvenile's noncompliance with any sentencing condition that
31 would require a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian to
32 pay money in order to comply.
33 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
34 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
35 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
36 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
37 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
38 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
39 days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
40 2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
41 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
42 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
43 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 days or
HB 2179 34
1 the overall case length limit.
2 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
3 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
4 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
5 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
6 facility.
7 (h)(g) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be
8 in effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
9 (i)(h) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
10 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
11 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
12 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
13 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
14 within 30 days of final disposition.
15 (j)(i) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to be
16 a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult would
17 constitute the commission of: (1) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined
18 in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14
19 years of age; (2) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503(a)(3), and
20 amendments thereto; (3) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as
21 defined in K.S.A. 21-5506(b)(3), and amendments thereto; (4) aggravated
22 criminal sodomy, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5504(b)(1) or (b)(2), and
23 amendments thereto; (5) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as
24 defined in K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less
25 than 14 years of age; (6) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in
26 K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is
27 less than 14 years of age; or (7) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal
28 solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and
29 amendments thereto, of an offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (6);
30 the court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the
31 attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If only one
32 attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are eligible to
33 attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile reside, the
34 court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim, the juvenile,
35 their families and a representative of the school district as to why the
36 juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the attendance center
37 attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may issue an order
38 prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center that the
39 victim of the offense attends.
40 (k)(j) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
41 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
42 foster home or community integration program if:
43 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
HB 2179 35
1 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
2 commission of:
3 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
4 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;
5 (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503, and amendments thereto;
6 (C) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A.
7 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
8 age;

15 (F) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in
16 K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an
17 offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (4); and
18 (2) (A) the victim resides in the same home as the juvenile offender;
19 (B) a community supervision officer in consultation with the
20 department for children and families determines that an adequate safety
21 plan, which shall include the physical and psychological well-being of the
22 victim, cannot be developed to keep the juvenile in the same home; and
23 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
24 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
25 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
26 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
27 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
28 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
29 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
30 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
31 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
32 initial order of the court.
33 (l)(k) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided
34 in K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.
35 (m)(l) The overall case length limit shall be calculated by the court
36 and entered into the written record when one or more of the sentencing
37 options under this section are imposed. The period fixed by the court
38 pursuant to subsection (a) shall not extend beyond the overall case length
39 limit.
40 Sec. 20. K.S.A. 38-2362 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
41 2362. (a) When sentencing a juvenile offender, the court may order a
42 juvenile offender's parent to participate in any evidence-based program
43 designed to rehabilitate the juvenile, including, but not limited to: (1)
HB 2179 36
1 Counseling, mediation sessions or an alcohol and drug evaluation and
2 treatment program ordered as part of the juvenile offender's sentence under
3 K.S.A. 38-2361, and amendments thereto; or (2) parenting classes.
4 (1) Upon entering an order requiring a juvenile offender's parent to
5 attend counseling sessions or mediation, the court shall give the parent
6 notice of the order. The notice shall inform the parent of the parent's right
7 to request a hearing within 14 days after entry of the order and the parent's
8 right to employ an attorney to represent the parent at the hearing or, if the
9 parent is financially unable to employ an attorney, the parent's right to
10 request the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent.
11 (2) If the parent does not request a hearing within 14 days after entry
12 of the order, the order shall take effect at that time.
13 (3) If the parent requests a hearing, the court shall set the matter for
14 hearing and, if requested, shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent.
15 The expense and fees of the appointed attorney may be allowed and
16 assessed as provided by K.S.A. 38-2306, and amendments thereto.
17 (b) In addition to any other orders provided for by this section, The
18 parent of a juvenile offender may shall not be held responsible for the
19 costs of sanctions, including, but not limited to, the cost of a house arrest
20 program, any evidence-based program ordered under subsection (a), any
21 parenting class ordered under subsection (a) or the support of the juvenile
22 offender as follows:
23 (1) The board of county commissioners of a county may provide by
24 resolution that the parent of any juvenile offender placed under a house
25 arrest program pursuant to subsection (a)(9) of K.S.A. 38-2361, and
26 amendments thereto, shall be required to pay to the county the cost of such
27 house arrest program. The board of county commissioners shall prepare a
28 sliding financial scale based on the ability of the parent to pay for such a
29 program.
30 (2) If child support has been requested and a parent has a duty to
31 support the juvenile offender, the court may order, and when custody is
32 placed with the commissioner shall order, one or both parents to pay child
33 support. The court shall determine, for each parent separately, whether the
34 parent already is subject to an order to pay support for the juvenile. If the
35 parent currently is not ordered to pay support for the juvenile and the court
36 has personal jurisdiction over the parent, the court shall order the parent to
37 pay child support in an amount determined under K.S.A. 38-2319, and
38 amendments thereto. Except for good cause shown, the court shall issue an
39 immediate income withholding order pursuant to K.S.A. 23-3101 et seq.,
40 and amendments thereto, for each parent ordered to pay support under this
41 subsection, regardless of whether a payor has been identified for the
42 parent. A parent ordered to pay child support under this subsection shall be
43 notified, at the hearing or otherwise, that the child support order may be
HB 2179 37
1 registered pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2321, and amendments thereto. The
2 parent also shall be informed that, after registration, the income
3 withholding order may be served on the parent's employer without further
4 notice to the parent and the child support order may be enforced by any
5 method allowed by law. Failure to provide this notice shall not affect the
6 validity of the child support order when placed out of the home.
7 Sec. 21. K.S.A. 38-2369 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
8 2369. (a) Except as provided in subsection (e) and K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13)
9 (a)(11), for the purpose of committing juvenile offenders to a juvenile
10 correctional facility, upon a finding by the judge entered into the written
11 order that the juvenile poses a significant risk of harm to another or
12 damage to property, the following placements shall be applied by the judge
13 in the cases specified in this subsection. If used, the court shall establish a
14 specific term of commitment as specified in this subsection. The term of
15 commitment established by the court shall not exceed the overall case
16 length limit. Before a juvenile offender is committed to a juvenile
17 correctional facility pursuant to this section, the court shall administer a
18 risk assessment tool, as described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments
19 thereto, or review a risk assessment tool that was administered within the
20 past six months to the juvenile.
21 (1) Violent Offenders. (A) The violent offender I is defined as an
22 offender adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense which, if
23 committed by an adult, would constitute an off-grid felony. Offenders in
24 this category may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a
25 minimum term of 60 months and up to a maximum term of the offender
26 reaching the age of 22 years, six months. The aftercare term for this
27 offender is set at a minimum term of six months and up to a maximum
28 term of the offender reaching the age of 23 years.
29 (B) The violent offender II is defined as an offender adjudicated as a
30 juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult, would

17 committed to a juvenile correctional facility if such offenders are assessed
18 as high-risk on a risk and needs assessment. Offenders in this category
19 may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a minimum term
20 of six months and up to a maximum term of 12 months.
21 (3) Chronic Offenders. (A) The chronic offender I, chronic felon is

42 recommends a different reentry plan.
43 (1) Upon finding the juvenile violated a requirement or requirements
HB 2179 39

2 orders:
3 (A) Recommend additional conditions be added to those of the

11 responsibilities in the case and enter any other appropriate orders.
12 (c) As used in this section "adjudication" includes out-of-state
13 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
14 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall
15 be classified as either a felony or a misdemeanor according to the
16 adjudicating jurisdiction. If an offense which if committed by an adult
17 would constitute the commission of a felony is a felony in another state, it
18 will be deemed a felony in Kansas. The state of Kansas shall classify the
19 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
20 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such
21 offense as person or nonperson, reference to comparable offenses shall be
22 made. If the state of Kansas does not have a comparable offense, the out-
23 of-state adjudication shall be classified as a nonperson offense.
24 (d) The secretary of corrections shall work with the community to
25 provide on-going support and incentives for the development of additional
26 evidence-based community practices and programs to ensure that the
27 juvenile correctional facility is not frequently utilized.
28 (e) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all offenders in the
29 chronic offender category and offenders at least 10 years of age but less
30 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
31 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
32 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. This
33 presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the record that the juvenile
34 offender poses a significant risk of physical harm to another.
35 Sec. 22. K.S.A. 38-2373 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
36 2373. (a) Actions by the court. (1) When a juvenile offender has been

42 the court wishes to recommend placement of the juvenile offender in a
43 specific juvenile correctional facility, the recommendation shall be
HB 2179 40
1 included in the sentence. After the court has received notice of the juvenile
2 correctional facility designated as provided in subsection (b), it shall be the
3 duty of the court or the sheriff of the county to deliver the juvenile
4 offender to the facility at the time designated by the secretary.
5 (2) When a juvenile offender is residing in a juvenile correctional
6 facility and is required to go back to court for any reason, the county
7 demanding the juvenile's presence shall be responsible for transportation,
8 detention, custody and control of such offender. In these cases, the county
9 sheriff shall be responsible for all transportation, detention, custody and
10 control of such offender.
11 (b) Actions by the secretary. (1) Within three days, excluding
12 Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after receiving notice of
13 commitment as provided in subsection (a), the secretary shall notify the
14 committing court of the facility to which the juvenile offender should be
15 conveyed, and when to effect the immediate transfer of custody and
16 control to the department of corrections. The date of admission shall be no
17 more than five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays,
18 after the notice to the committing court. Until received at the designated
19 facility, the continuing detention, custody, and control of and transport for
20 a juvenile offender sentenced to a direct commitment to a juvenile
21 correctional facility shall be the responsibility of the committing county.
22 (2) Except as provided by K.S.A. 38-2332, and amendments thereto,
23 the secretary may make any temporary out-of-home placement the
24 secretary deems appropriate pending placement of the juvenile offender in
25 a juvenile correctional facility, and the secretary shall notify the court,
26 local law enforcement agency and school district in which the juvenile will
27 be residing if the juvenile is still required to attend a secondary school of
28 that placement.
29 (c) Transfers. During the time a juvenile offender remains committed
30 to a juvenile correctional facility, the secretary may transfer the juvenile
31 offender from one juvenile correctional facility to another.
32 (d) Case planning. For all juveniles committed to a juvenile
33 correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(11)(a)(10), and
34 amendments thereto, a case plan shall be developed with input from the
35 juvenile and the juvenile's family. For all those committed upon violation
36 of a condition of sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments
37 thereto, the case plan developed with the juvenile's community supervision
38 officer shall be revised to reflect the new disposition. The department for
39 children and families, the local school district in which the juvenile
40 offender will be residing and community supervision officers may also
41 participate in the development or revision of the case plan when
42 appropriate. The case plan shall incorporate the results of the risk and
43 needs assessment, the programs and education to complete while in
HB 2179 41
1 custody and shall clearly define the role of each person or agency working
2 with the juvenile. The case plan shall include a reentry section, detailing
3 services, education, supervision or any other elements necessary for a
4 successful transition. The reentry section of the case plan shall also include
5 information on reintegration of the juvenile into such juvenile's family or,
6 if reintegration is not a viable alternative, another viable release option. If
7 the juvenile is to be placed on conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
8 2369, the case plan shall be developed with the community supervision
9 officer.
10 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 38-2384 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
11 2384. When an appeal is taken pursuant to this code, fees of an attorney
12 appointed to represent the juvenile offender shall be fixed by the district
13 court. The fees, together with the costs of transcripts and records on
14 appeal, shall be taxed as expenses on appeal paid from the county general
15 fund and shall not be subject to reimbursement by the juvenile or the
16 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian. The court on appeal may assess
17 the fees and expenses against the appealing party or order that they be paid
18 from the county general fund. When the court orders the fees and expenses
19 assessed against the appealing party:
20 (a) The fees and expenses shall be paid from the county general fund,
21 subject to reimbursement by the appealing party; and
22 (b) the county may enforce the order as a civil judgment, except the
23 county shall not be required to pay the docket fee or fee for execution.
24 Sec. 24. K.S.A. 38-2389 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
25 2389. (a) Findings and purpose. The following findings and declaration of
26 purpose apply to this section.
27 (1) The legislature finds that personal and familial circumstances may
28 contribute to the commission of offenses by juveniles who represent a
29 minimal threat to public safety and that in such cases it would further the
30 interests of society and the juvenile to take an approach to adjudication
31 that combines less formal procedures, appropriate disciplinary sanctions
32 for misconduct and the provision of necessary services.
33 (2) It is the purpose of this section to provide prosecutors with an
34 alternative means of adjudication for juvenile offenders who present a
35 minimal threat to public safety and both the juvenile and society would
36 benefit from such approach.
37 (b) Designation. A county or district attorney with jurisdiction over
38 the offense who believes that proceedings under this section are
39 appropriate may, in such county or district attorney's discretion, designate
40 any alleged juvenile offender for adjudication under this section and not
41 seek application of a placement within the placement matrix pursuant to
42 K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto, if the alleged juvenile has fewer
43 than two prior adjudications.
HB 2179 42
1 (1) The county or district attorney shall make such designation in the
2 original complaint or by written notice filed with the court and served on
3 the juvenile, the juvenile's counsel and the juvenile's parent or legal
4 guardian within 14 days after the filing of the complaint.
5 (2) The filing of a written application for immediate intervention
6 under K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, shall toll the running of
7 the 14-day period and shall resume upon the issuance of a written denial of
8 diversion.
9 (3) If the county or district attorney makes such designation, the
10 juvenile may be referred to an immediate intervention program established
11 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, and in compliance
12 with the standards and procedures developed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2396,
13 and amendments thereto.
14 (c) Exceptions. Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions
15 of the revised Kansas juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301 et seq., and
16 amendments thereto, shall apply in any adjudication under this section.
17 (1) If during the proceedings the court determines that there is
18 probable cause to believe that the juvenile is a child in need of care as
19 defined by K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto, the court shall refer
20 the matter to the county or district attorney, who shall file a petition as
21 provided in K.S.A. 38-2234, and amendments thereto, and refer the family
22 to the Kansas department for children and families for services. If the child
23 in need of care case is presided over by a different judge, the county or
24 district attorney shall notify the court presiding over the proceedings under
25 this section of pertinent orders entered in the child in need of care case.
26 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no juvenile shall be
27 committed to a juvenile correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)
28 (11)(a)(10), and amendments thereto, for an offense adjudicated under this
29 section or for the violation of a term or condition of the disposition for
30 such an offense.
31 (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjudication under
32 this section or violation of the terms and conditions of the disposition shall
33 be used against the juvenile in a proceeding on a subsequent offense
34 committed as a juvenile or as an adult. For purposes of this section, ''used
35 against the juvenile'' includes, but is not limited to, establishing an element
36 of a subsequent offense, raising the severity level of a subsequent offense
37 or enhancing the sentence for a subsequent offense.
38 (4) Upon completion of the case and the termination of the court's
39 jurisdiction, the court shall order the adjudication expunged, and the
40 provisions of K.S.A. 38-2312(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), (k) and (l), and
41 amendments thereto, shall not apply to such expungement.
42 (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a juvenile shall not
43 be required to register as an offender under the Kansas offender
HB 2179 43
1 registration act, K.S.A. 22-4901 et seq., and amendments thereto, as a
2 result of adjudication under this section.
3 (6) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2309 and 38-2310, and amendments
4 thereto, shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
5 (7) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2347, and amendments thereto, shall
6 not apply to proceedings under this section.
7 (8) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2304(g)(1), and amendments thereto,
8 shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
9 (9) The trial of offenses under this section shall be to the court and
10 the right to a trial by jury under K.S.A. 38-2357, and amendments thereto,
11 shall not apply.
12 (d) Withdrawal. At any time prior to the beginning of a hearing at
13 which the court may enter an order adjudicating the child as a juvenile
14 offender, the county or district attorney may withdraw the designation for
15 proceedings under this section by providing notice to the court, the
16 juvenile, the juvenile's attorney and guardian ad litem, if any, and the
17 juvenile's parent or legal guardian. Upon withdrawal of the designation,
18 this section shall no longer apply and the case shall proceed and the court
19 shall grant a continuance upon request.
20 (e) Appeal. An adjudication under this section is an appealable order
21 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2380, and amendments thereto.
22 (f) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the revised
23 Kansas juvenile justice code.
24 Sec. 25. K.S.A. 38-2396 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
25 2396. (a) When a juvenile is placed outside the juvenile's home at a
26 dispositional hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(k)(j), and amendments
27 thereto, and no reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the
28 hearing, a written reintegration plan shall be prepared and submitted to the
29 court within 15 days of the initial order of the court.
30 (b) The plan shall be prepared by the person who has custody or, if
31 directed by the court, by a community supervision officer.
32 (c) If there is a lack of agreement among persons necessary for the
33 success of the plan, the person or entity having custody of the child shall
34 notify the court, and the court shall set a hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
35 2367, and amendments thereto.
36 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
37 Kansas juvenile justice code.
38 (e) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2017.
39 Sec. 26. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
40 2399. (a) The secretary of corrections may contract for use of not more
41 than 50 non-foster home beds in youth residential facilities for placement
42 of juvenile offenders pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13)(a)(11), and
43 amendments thereto.
HB 2179 44
1 (b) When contracting for services, the secretary shall:
2 (1) Contract with facilities that have high success rates and decrease
3 recidivism rates for juvenile offenders;
4 (2) consider contracting for bed space across the entire state to lower
5 the cost of transportation of juvenile offenders; and
6 (3) give priority to existing facilities that are able to meet the
7 requirements of the secretary for providing residential services to juvenile
8 offenders.
9 (c) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2018.
10 Sec. 27. K.S.A. 75-724 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-724.
11 (a) Any person convicted or adjudicated of an offense that, pursuant to
12 K.S.A. 21-2511, and amendments thereto, requires submission of a DNA
13 sample upon arrest, charging or placement in custody, shall pay a separate
14 court cost of $200 as a Kansas bureau of investigation DNA database fee
15 upon conviction or adjudication.
16 (b) The court shall order such fees regardless of whether the person's
17 DNA sample was already on file with the Kansas bureau of investigation
18 at the time such person was arrested, charged or placed in custody, unless
19 the person can prove to the court that the person: (1) Has paid such fees in
20 connection with a prior conviction or adjudication; and (2) did not submit
21 specimens of blood or an oral or other biological sample authorized by the
22 Kansas bureau of investigation to the Kansas bureau of investigation for
23 the current offense of conviction or adjudication.
24 (c) The court shall not lessen or waive such fees unless the court has
25 determined such person is indigent and the basis for the court's
26 determination is reflected in the court's order.
27 (d) Such fees shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any
28 and all fines and penalties otherwise provided for by law for such offense.
29 (e) Disbursements from the Kansas bureau of investigation DNA
30 database fee deposited into the DNA database fee fund of the Kansas

23 registering law enforcement agency of the county or location of
24 jurisdiction in which the treatment facility is located of the offender's
25 presence at the treatment facility and the expected duration of the
26 treatment;
27 (k) submit to the taking of an updated photograph by the registering
28 law enforcement agency on each occasion when the offender registers with
29 or reports to the registering law enforcement agency in the county or
30 location of jurisdiction in which the offender resides, maintains
31 employment or attends school. In addition, such offender shall submit to
32 the taking of a photograph to document any changes in identifying
33 characteristics, including, but not limited to, scars, marks and tattoos;
34 (l) remit payment to the sheriff's office in the amount of $20 as part of
35 the reporting process required pursuant to subsection (b) in each county in
36 which the offender resides, maintains employment or is attending school.
37 Registration will be completed regardless of whether or not the offender
38 remits payment. Failure of the offender to remit full payment within 15
39 days of registration is a violation of the Kansas offender registration act
40 and is subject to prosecution pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4903, and amendments
41 thereto. Notwithstanding other provisions herein of this section, payment
42 of this fee is not required:

HB 2179 25
1 2348. (a) (1) For the purpose of this section, a person charged as a juvenile
2 is incompetent for adjudication as a juvenile offender if, because of mental
3 illness or defect, such person is unable to:
4 (1)(A) Understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings; or
5 (2)(B) make or assist in making a defense.
6 (2) Whenever the words "competent," "competency," "incompetent"
7 and "incompetency" are used without qualification in this code, such
8 words shall refer to the standard for incompetency described in this
9 subsection.
10 (b) (1) If at any time after such person has been charged as a juvenile
11 there is reason to believe that the juvenile is incompetent for adjudication
12 as a juvenile offender, the proceedings shall be suspended and the court
13 before whom the case is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the
14 competency of the juvenile. Such a hearing may be held upon the motion
15 of the juvenile's attorney or the prosecuting attorney, or upon the court's
16 own motion.
17 (2) The court shall determine the issue of competency. To facilitate in
18 this determination, the court may: (A) Appoint a licensed psychiatrist or
19 psychologist to examine the juvenile; or (B) designate a private or public
20 mental health facility to conduct a psychiatric or psychological
21 examination and report to the court. If the examining psychiatrist,
22 psychologist or private or public mental health facility determines that
23 further examination is necessary, the court may commit the juvenile for not
24 more than 60 days to any appropriate public or private institution for
25 examination and report to the court. For good cause shown, the
26 commitment may be extended for another 60 days. No statement made by
27 the juvenile in the course of any examination provided for by this section,
28 whether the examination is with or without the consent of the juvenile,
29 shall be admitted in evidence against the juvenile in any hearing.

31 injurious to the juvenile's health, the juvenile shall be present personally at
32 all proceedings under this section.
33 (c) If the juvenile is found to be competent, the proceedings which
34 have been suspended shall be resumed.
35 (d) If the juvenile is found to be incompetent, the juvenile shall
36 remain subject to the jurisdiction of the court and shall be committed for
37 evaluation and treatment pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2349 and 38-2350, and
38 amendments thereto. One or both parents of the juvenile may be ordered to
39 pay child support pursuant to the Kansas child support guidelines. Upon
40 application of the juvenile and in the discretion of the court, the juvenile
41 may be released to any appropriate private institution upon terms and
42 conditions prescribed by the court.
43 (e) If at any time after proceedings have been suspended under this

HB 2179 26
1 section, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a juvenile who has
2 been adjudged incompetent is now competent, the court in which the case
3 is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the juvenile's present
4 mental condition. Reasonable notice of the hearings shall be given to the
5 prosecuting attorney, the juvenile and the juvenile's attorney of record, if
6 any. If the court, following the hearing, finds the juvenile to be competent,
7 the pending proceedings shall be resumed.

19 court orders an evaluation as provided in this section, a parent of the
20 juvenile shall have the right to obtain an independent evaluation at the
21 expense of no cost to the parent. If the evaluation indicates that the
22 juvenile requires acute inpatient mental health or substance abuse
23 treatment, the court shall have the authority to compel an assessment by
24 the secretary for aging and disability services. The court may use the
25 results to inform a treatment and payment plan according to the same
26 eligibility process used for non-court-involved youth. No juvenile or
27 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian shall be required to pay for
28 treatment ordered by the court pursuant to this section.

35 party, shall hear additional evidence as to proposals for reasonable and
36 appropriate sentencing of the case.

16 (11)(9) Upon a violation of a condition of sentence, other than a
17 technical violation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto,
18 commit the juvenile to detention for a period no longer than 30 days
19 subject to the provisions of subsection (g).
20 (12)(10) If the judge finds and enters into the written record that the
21 juvenile poses a significant risk of harm to another or damage to property,
22 and the juvenile is otherwise eligible for commitment pursuant to K.S.A.
23 38-2369, and amendments thereto, commit the juvenile directly to the
24 custody of the secretary of corrections for placement in a juvenile
25 correctional facility or a youth residential facility. Placement in a youth
26 residential facility shall only be permitted as authorized in K.S.A. 38-
27 2369(e), and amendments thereto. If the court elects, a period of
28 conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
29 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
30 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
31 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
32 facility, the secretary of corrections or designee shall notify the court of the
33 juvenile's anticipated release date. This alternative may be ordered with the
34 alternative in paragraph (7). Requirements pertaining to child support shall
35 apply under this alternative.
36 (13)(11) Upon a finding by the trier of fact during adjudication that a
37 firearm was used in the commission of an offense by the accused which, if
38 committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, a judge may commit the
39 juvenile directly to the custody of the secretary of corrections for
40 placement in a juvenile correctional facility or youth residential facility for
41 a minimum term of six months and up to a maximum term of 18 months,
42 regardless of the risk level of such juvenile as determined by a risk and
43 needs assessment. If the juvenile is committed to the custody of the

HB 2179 30
1 secretary, and the court elects, a period of conditional release, pursuant to
2 K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto, may also be ordered. The period
3 of conditional release shall be limited to a maximum of six months and
4 shall be subject to graduated responses. Twenty-one days prior to the
5 juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional facility or youth residential

10 pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the following provisions apply:
11 (1) The court may order the juvenile offender to participate in
12 counseling or mediation sessions or a program of education, including
13 placement in an alternative educational program approved by a local
14 school board. The costs of any counseling or mediation may shall not be
15 assessed as expenses in the case. No mental health center shall charge a fee
16 for court-ordered counseling greater than what the center would have
17 charged the person receiving the counseling if the person had requested
18 counseling on the person's own initiative. No mediator shall charge a fee
19 for court-ordered mediation greater than what the mediator would have
20 charged the person participating in the mediation if the person had
21 requested mediation on the person's own initiative. Mediation may include
22 the victim but shall not be mandatory for the victim; and
23 (2) if the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile by reason of a
24 violation of a statute that makes such a requirement, the court shall order
25 and, if adjudicated for any other offense, the court may order the juvenile
26 to submit to and complete a drug and alcohol evaluation by a community-
27 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
28 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
29 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
30 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
31 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
32 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
33 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
34 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
35 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
36 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
37 the fee. In no event shall The fee shall not be assessed against the secretary
38 of corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be
39 assessed against the secretary of the department for children and families
40 or the Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
41 secretary's care, custody and control. The court shall not assess any fee for
42 the evaluation or program, including, but not limited to, any ongoing
43 required drug or alcohol testing, against the juvenile, the juvenile's parent,

HB 2179 31
1 guardian or custodian.
2 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
3 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
4 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
5 provisions apply:
6 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
7 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
8 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
9 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
10 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
11 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
12 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
13 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
14 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
15 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
16 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
17 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
18 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
19 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
20 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
21 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
22 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
23 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
24 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
25 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
26 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
27 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
28 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
29 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
30 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
31 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
32 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
33 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
34 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
35 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
36 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
37 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
38 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
39 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
40 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
41 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
42 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
43 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of

HB 2179 32
1 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
2 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
3 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
4 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
5 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
6 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
7 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
8 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
9 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
10 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
11 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
12 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
13 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
14 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
15 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
16 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
17 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
18 conditions.
19 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
20 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
21 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
22 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
23 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
24 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
25 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
26 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
27 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
28 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
29 organizations performing services for the community; and
30 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
31 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
32 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
33 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
34 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
35 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
36 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
37 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
38 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
39 following provisions apply:
40 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
41 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
42 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
43 lump sum or installments;

HB 2179 33
1 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
2 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
3 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
4 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
5 imposition of a fine; and
6 (3) any fine imposed by court shall be a judgment against the juvenile
7 that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other execution as on
8 judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the
9 termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
10 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
11 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
12 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
13 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
14 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
15 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
16 (g)(f) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
17 subsection (a)(11) (a)(9), the following provisions shall apply:
18 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
19 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
20 exhausted. The court shall not order commitment to detention for
21 nonpayment of any fine, fee cost or restitution, including in cases where
22 nonpayment constitutes a violation of sentencing conditions.
23 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
24 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
25 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
26 new felony offense, or violates conditional release. No such finding shall
27 be based in whole or in part on:
28 (A) Nonpayment of fines, fees, costs or other financial obligations by
29 the juvenile, the juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian; or
30 (B) a juvenile's noncompliance with any sentencing condition that
31 would require a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian to
32 pay money in order to comply.
33 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
34 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
35 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
36 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
37 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
38 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
39 days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
40 2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
41 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
42 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
43 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 days or

HB 2179 34
1 the overall case length limit.
2 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
3 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
4 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
5 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
6 facility.
7 (h)(g) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be
8 in effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
9 (i)(h) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
10 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
11 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
12 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
13 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
14 within 30 days of final disposition.
15 (j)(i) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to be
16 a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult would
17 constitute the commission of: (1) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined
18 in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14
19 years of age; (2) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503(a)(3), and
20 amendments thereto; (3) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as

25 than 14 years of age; (6) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in
26 K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is
27 less than 14 years of age; or (7) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal
28 solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and
29 amendments thereto, of an offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (6);
30 the court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the
31 attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If only one
32 attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are eligible to
33 attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile reside, the
34 court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim, the juvenile,
35 their families and a representative of the school district as to why the
36 juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the attendance center
37 attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may issue an order
38 prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center that the
39 victim of the offense attends.
40 (k)(j) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
41 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
42 foster home or community integration program if:
43 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for

HB 2179 35
1 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
2 commission of:
3 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
4 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;
5 (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503, and amendments thereto;

23 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
24 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
25 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
26 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
27 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
28 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
29 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
30 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
31 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
32 initial order of the court.
33 (l)(k) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided
34 in K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.

40 Sec. 20. K.S.A. 38-2362 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
41 2362. (a) When sentencing a juvenile offender, the court may order a

6 notice of the order. The notice shall inform the parent of the parent's right
7 to request a hearing within 14 days after entry of the order and the parent's
8 right to employ an attorney to represent the parent at the hearing or, if the
9 parent is financially unable to employ an attorney, the parent's right to
10 request the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent.
11 (2) If the parent does not request a hearing within 14 days after entry
12 of the order, the order shall take effect at that time.
13 (3) If the parent requests a hearing, the court shall set the matter for
14 hearing and, if requested, shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent.
15 The expense and fees of the appointed attorney may be allowed and
16 assessed as provided by K.S.A. 38-2306, and amendments thereto.

36 has personal jurisdiction over the parent, the court shall order the parent to
37 pay child support in an amount determined under K.S.A. 38-2319, and
38 amendments thereto. Except for good cause shown, the court shall issue an

38 thereto. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a maximum of
39 six months and shall be subject to graduated responses. The presumption
40 upon release shall be a return to the juvenile's home, unless the case plan
41 developed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2373, and amendments thereto,
42 recommends a different reentry plan.
43 (1) Upon finding the juvenile violated a requirement or requirements

HB 2179 39
1 of conditional release, the court may enter one or more of the following
2 orders:
3 (A) Recommend additional conditions be added to those of the
4 existing conditional release.
5 (B) Order the offender to serve a period of detention pursuant to
6 K.S.A. 38-2361(g)(f), and amendments thereto.
7 (C) Revoke or restrict the juvenile's driving privileges as described in
8 K.S.A. 38-2361(c), and amendments thereto.
9 (2) Discharge the offender from the custody of the secretary of
10 corrections, release the secretary of corrections from further
11 responsibilities in the case and enter any other appropriate orders.
12 (c) As used in this section "adjudication" includes out-of-state
13 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
14 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall
15 be classified as either a felony or a misdemeanor according to the
16 adjudicating jurisdiction. If an offense which if committed by an adult
17 would constitute the commission of a felony is a felony in another state, it
18 will be deemed a felony in Kansas. The state of Kansas shall classify the
19 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
20 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such
21 offense as person or nonperson, reference to comparable offenses shall be
22 made. If the state of Kansas does not have a comparable offense, the out-
23 of-state adjudication shall be classified as a nonperson offense.
24 (d) The secretary of corrections shall work with the community to
25 provide on-going support and incentives for the development of additional
26 evidence-based community practices and programs to ensure that the
27 juvenile correctional facility is not frequently utilized.
28 (e) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all offenders in the
29 chronic offender category and offenders at least 10 years of age but less
30 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
31 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
32 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. This
33 presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the record that the juvenile
34 offender poses a significant risk of physical harm to another.
35 Sec. 22. K.S.A. 38-2373 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
36 2373. (a) Actions by the court. (1) When a juvenile offender has been
37 committed to a juvenile correctional facility, the clerk of the court shall
38 promptly notify the secretary of corrections of the commitment and
39 provide the secretary with a certified copy of the complaint, the journal
40 entry of the adjudication and sentencing. The court shall provide those
41 items from the social file which could relate to a rehabilitative program. If
42 the court wishes to recommend placement of the juvenile offender in a
43 specific juvenile correctional facility, the recommendation shall be

HB 2179 40
1 included in the sentence. After the court has received notice of the juvenile
2 correctional facility designated as provided in subsection (b), it shall be the
3 duty of the court or the sheriff of the county to deliver the juvenile
4 offender to the facility at the time designated by the secretary.
5 (2) When a juvenile offender is residing in a juvenile correctional
6 facility and is required to go back to court for any reason, the county
7 demanding the juvenile's presence shall be responsible for transportation,
8 detention, custody and control of such offender. In these cases, the county
9 sheriff shall be responsible for all transportation, detention, custody and
10 control of such offender.
11 (b) Actions by the secretary. (1) Within three days, excluding
12 Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after receiving notice of
13 commitment as provided in subsection (a), the secretary shall notify the
14 committing court of the facility to which the juvenile offender should be
15 conveyed, and when to effect the immediate transfer of custody and
16 control to the department of corrections. The date of admission shall be no
17 more than five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays,
18 after the notice to the committing court. Until received at the designated
19 facility, the continuing detention, custody, and control of and transport for
20 a juvenile offender sentenced to a direct commitment to a juvenile
21 correctional facility shall be the responsibility of the committing county.
22 (2) Except as provided by K.S.A. 38-2332, and amendments thereto,
23 the secretary may make any temporary out-of-home placement the
24 secretary deems appropriate pending placement of the juvenile offender in
25 a juvenile correctional facility, and the secretary shall notify the court,
26 local law enforcement agency and school district in which the juvenile will
27 be residing if the juvenile is still required to attend a secondary school of
28 that placement.
29 (c) Transfers. During the time a juvenile offender remains committed
30 to a juvenile correctional facility, the secretary may transfer the juvenile
31 offender from one juvenile correctional facility to another.
32 (d) Case planning. For all juveniles committed to a juvenile
33 correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(11)(a)(10), and
34 amendments thereto, a case plan shall be developed with input from the
35 juvenile and the juvenile's family. For all those committed upon violation
36 of a condition of sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments
37 thereto, the case plan developed with the juvenile's community supervision
38 officer shall be revised to reflect the new disposition. The department for
39 children and families, the local school district in which the juvenile
40 offender will be residing and community supervision officers may also
41 participate in the development or revision of the case plan when
42 appropriate. The case plan shall incorporate the results of the risk and
43 needs assessment, the programs and education to complete while in

HB 2179 41
1 custody and shall clearly define the role of each person or agency working
2 with the juvenile. The case plan shall include a reentry section, detailing
3 services, education, supervision or any other elements necessary for a
4 successful transition. The reentry section of the case plan shall also include
5 information on reintegration of the juvenile into such juvenile's family or,
6 if reintegration is not a viable alternative, another viable release option. If
7 the juvenile is to be placed on conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
8 2369, the case plan shall be developed with the community supervision
9 officer.
10 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 38-2384 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
11 2384. When an appeal is taken pursuant to this code, fees of an attorney
12 appointed to represent the juvenile offender shall be fixed by the district
13 court. The fees, together with the costs of transcripts and records on
14 appeal, shall be taxed as expenses on appeal paid from the county general
15 fund and shall not be subject to reimbursement by the juvenile or the
16 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian. The court on appeal may assess
17 the fees and expenses against the appealing party or order that they be paid
18 from the county general fund. When the court orders the fees and expenses
19 assessed against the appealing party:
20 (a) The fees and expenses shall be paid from the county general fund,
21 subject to reimbursement by the appealing party; and
22 (b) the county may enforce the order as a civil judgment, except the
23 county shall not be required to pay the docket fee or fee for execution.
24 Sec. 24. K.S.A. 38-2389 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
25 2389. (a) Findings and purpose. The following findings and declaration of
26 purpose apply to this section.
27 (1) The legislature finds that personal and familial circumstances may
28 contribute to the commission of offenses by juveniles who represent a
29 minimal threat to public safety and that in such cases it would further the
30 interests of society and the juvenile to take an approach to adjudication
31 that combines less formal procedures, appropriate disciplinary sanctions
32 for misconduct and the provision of necessary services.
33 (2) It is the purpose of this section to provide prosecutors with an
34 alternative means of adjudication for juvenile offenders who present a
35 minimal threat to public safety and both the juvenile and society would
36 benefit from such approach.
37 (b) Designation. A county or district attorney with jurisdiction over
38 the offense who believes that proceedings under this section are
39 appropriate may, in such county or district attorney's discretion, designate
40 any alleged juvenile offender for adjudication under this section and not
41 seek application of a placement within the placement matrix pursuant to
42 K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto, if the alleged juvenile has fewer
43 than two prior adjudications.

HB 2179 42
1 (1) The county or district attorney shall make such designation in the
2 original complaint or by written notice filed with the court and served on
3 the juvenile, the juvenile's counsel and the juvenile's parent or legal
4 guardian within 14 days after the filing of the complaint.
5 (2) The filing of a written application for immediate intervention
6 under K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, shall toll the running of
7 the 14-day period and shall resume upon the issuance of a written denial of
8 diversion.
9 (3) If the county or district attorney makes such designation, the
10 juvenile may be referred to an immediate intervention program established
11 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, and in compliance
12 with the standards and procedures developed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2396,
13 and amendments thereto.
14 (c) Exceptions. Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions
15 of the revised Kansas juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301 et seq., and
16 amendments thereto, shall apply in any adjudication under this section.
17 (1) If during the proceedings the court determines that there is
18 probable cause to believe that the juvenile is a child in need of care as
19 defined by K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto, the court shall refer
20 the matter to the county or district attorney, who shall file a petition as
21 provided in K.S.A. 38-2234, and amendments thereto, and refer the family
22 to the Kansas department for children and families for services. If the child
23 in need of care case is presided over by a different judge, the county or
24 district attorney shall notify the court presiding over the proceedings under
25 this section of pertinent orders entered in the child in need of care case.
26 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no juvenile shall be
27 committed to a juvenile correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)
28 (11)(a)(10), and amendments thereto, for an offense adjudicated under this
29 section or for the violation of a term or condition of the disposition for
30 such an offense.
31 (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjudication under
32 this section or violation of the terms and conditions of the disposition shall
33 be used against the juvenile in a proceeding on a subsequent offense
34 committed as a juvenile or as an adult. For purposes of this section, ''used
35 against the juvenile'' includes, but is not limited to, establishing an element
36 of a subsequent offense, raising the severity level of a subsequent offense
37 or enhancing the sentence for a subsequent offense.
38 (4) Upon completion of the case and the termination of the court's
39 jurisdiction, the court shall order the adjudication expunged, and the
40 provisions of K.S.A. 38-2312(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), (k) and (l), and
41 amendments thereto, shall not apply to such expungement.
42 (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a juvenile shall not
43 be required to register as an offender under the Kansas offender

HB 2179 43
1 registration act, K.S.A. 22-4901 et seq., and amendments thereto, as a
2 result of adjudication under this section.
3 (6) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2309 and 38-2310, and amendments
4 thereto, shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
5 (7) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2347, and amendments thereto, shall
6 not apply to proceedings under this section.
7 (8) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2304(g)(1), and amendments thereto,
8 shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
9 (9) The trial of offenses under this section shall be to the court and
10 the right to a trial by jury under K.S.A. 38-2357, and amendments thereto,
11 shall not apply.
12 (d) Withdrawal. At any time prior to the beginning of a hearing at
13 which the court may enter an order adjudicating the child as a juvenile
14 offender, the county or district attorney may withdraw the designation for
15 proceedings under this section by providing notice to the court, the
16 juvenile, the juvenile's attorney and guardian ad litem, if any, and the
17 juvenile's parent or legal guardian. Upon withdrawal of the designation,
18 this section shall no longer apply and the case shall proceed and the court
19 shall grant a continuance upon request.
20 (e) Appeal. An adjudication under this section is an appealable order
21 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2380, and amendments thereto.
22 (f) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the revised
23 Kansas juvenile justice code.
24 Sec. 25. K.S.A. 38-2396 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
25 2396. (a) When a juvenile is placed outside the juvenile's home at a
26 dispositional hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(k)(j), and amendments
27 thereto, and no reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the
28 hearing, a written reintegration plan shall be prepared and submitted to the
29 court within 15 days of the initial order of the court.
30 (b) The plan shall be prepared by the person who has custody or, if
31 directed by the court, by a community supervision officer.
32 (c) If there is a lack of agreement among persons necessary for the
33 success of the plan, the person or entity having custody of the child shall
34 notify the court, and the court shall set a hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
35 2367, and amendments thereto.
36 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
37 Kansas juvenile justice code.
38 (e) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2017.
39 Sec. 26. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
40 2399. (a) The secretary of corrections may contract for use of not more
41 than 50 non-foster home beds in youth residential facilities for placement
42 of juvenile offenders pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13)(a)(11), and
43 amendments thereto.

HB 2179 44
1 (b) When contracting for services, the secretary shall:
2 (1) Contract with facilities that have high success rates and decrease
3 recidivism rates for juvenile offenders;
4 (2) consider contracting for bed space across the entire state to lower
5 the cost of transportation of juvenile offenders; and

7 requirements of the secretary for providing residential services to juvenile
8 offenders.
9 (c) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2018.
10 Sec. 27. K.S.A. 75-724 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-724.
11 (a) Any person convicted or adjudicated of an offense that, pursuant to
12 K.S.A. 21-2511, and amendments thereto, requires submission of a DNA
13 sample upon arrest, charging or placement in custody, shall pay a separate
14 court cost of $200 as a Kansas bureau of investigation DNA database fee
15 upon conviction or adjudication.
16 (b) The court shall order such fees regardless of whether the person's
17 DNA sample was already on file with the Kansas bureau of investigation
18 at the time such person was arrested, charged or placed in custody, unless
19 the person can prove to the court that the person: (1) Has paid such fees in
20 connection with a prior conviction or adjudication; and (2) did not submit
21 specimens of blood or an oral or other biological sample authorized by the
22 Kansas bureau of investigation to the Kansas bureau of investigation for
23 the current offense of conviction or adjudication.
24 (c) The court shall not lessen or waive such fees unless the court has
25 determined such person is indigent and the basis for the court's
26 determination is reflected in the court's order.
27 (d) Such fees shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any
28 and all fines and penalties otherwise provided for by law for such offense.
