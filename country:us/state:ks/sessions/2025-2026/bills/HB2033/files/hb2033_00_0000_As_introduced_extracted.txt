31 training for evidence-based best practices for at-risk educational programs;
32 or
33 (4) services contracted for by the school district to provide such at-
34 risk and provisional at-risk educational programs.
HB 2033 2

30 make expenditures from the school district's at-risk education fund to
31 commence and implement a provisional at-risk educational program. The
32 state board shall approve any provisional at-risk educational program prior
33 to the implementation of the provisional at-risk educational program by a
34 school district. Any provisional at-risk educational program approved by
35 the state board and implemented by a school district shall be subject to
36 school district review while such program is implemented in the school
37 district to evaluate whether the program is producing or likely to produce
38 measurable success. If any provisional at-risk educational program is
39 determined by the state board to provide evidence-based instruction, the
40 state board shall include such program or service on the list of approved
41 at-risk educational programs.
42 (C) If the state board removes any program or service from the state
43 board's list of approved at-risk educational programs and services, a school

20 evidence-based instruction or practice that is provided in excess of regular

23 provide a collateral benefit to students who are not so identified without
24 any additional cost.

26 service that is identified and approved by the state board as providing
27 evidence-based instruction to students who are identified as eligible to

30 (3) "Evidence-based instruction" means an education delivery
31 practice based on peer reviewed research that consistently produces better
32 student outcomes over a one-year period than would otherwise be
33 achieved by the same students who are identified as eligible to receive at-
34 risk educational programs and services.
35 (4) "Provisional at-risk educational program" means an education
36 delivery practice that is identified or developed by a school district as a

2 educational programs if the provisional at-risk educational program is
3 shown to provide evidence-based instruction to students who are identified
4 as eligible to receive at-risk educational programs and services.
5 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 72-5153 is hereby repealed.
