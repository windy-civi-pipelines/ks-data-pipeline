7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 39-709. (a) General eligibility requirements for assistance for
9 which federal moneys are expended. Subject to the additional requirements
10 below, assistance in accordance with plans under which federal moneys
11 are expended may be granted to any needy person who:
12 (1) Has insufficient income or resources to provide a reasonable
13 subsistence compatible with decency and health. Where a husband and
14 wife or cohabiting partners are living together, the combined income or
15 resources of both shall be considered in determining the eligibility of
16 either or both for such assistance unless otherwise prohibited by law. The
17 secretary, in determining need of any applicant for or recipient of
18 assistance shall not take into account the financial responsibility of any
19 individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance unless such applicant
20 or recipient is such individual's spouse, cohabiting partner or such
21 individual's minor child or minor stepchild if the stepchild is living with
22 such individual. The secretary in determining need of an individual may
23 provide such income and resource exemptions as may be permitted by
24 federal law. For purposes of eligibility for temporary assistance for needy
25 families, for food assistance and for any other assistance provided through
26 the Kansas department for children and families under which federal
27 moneys are expended, the secretary for children and families shall
28 consider one motor vehicle owned by the applicant for assistance,
29 regardless of the value of such vehicle, as exempt personal property and
30 shall consider any equity in any boat, personal water craft, recreational
31 vehicle, recreational off-highway vehicle or all-terrain vehicle, as defined
32 by K.S.A. 8-126, and amendments thereto, or any additional motor vehicle
33 owned by the applicant for assistance to be a nonexempt resource of the
34 applicant for assistance except that any additional motor vehicle used by
35 the applicant, the applicant's spouse or the applicant's cohabiting partner
36 for the primary purpose of earning income may be considered as exempt
SB 158 2
1 personal property in the secretary's discretion; or
2 (2) is a citizen of the United States or is an alien lawfully admitted to
3 the United States and who is residing in the state of Kansas.
4 (b) Temporary assistance for needy families. Assistance may be
5 granted under this act to any dependent child, or relative, subject to the
6 general eligibility requirements as set out in subsection (a), who resides in
7 the state of Kansas or whose parent or other relative with whom the child
8 is living resides in the state of Kansas. Such assistance shall be known as
9 temporary assistance for needy families. Where the husband and wife or
10 cohabiting partners are living together, both shall register for work under
11 the program requirements for temporary assistance for needy families in
12 accordance with criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations
13 of the secretary.

18 include a cohabiting boyfriend or girlfriend living with the person legally
19 responsible for the child. The family group shall not be eligible for TANF
20 if the family group contains at least one adult member who has received
21 TANF, including the federal TANF assistance received in any other state,
22 for 24 calendar months beginning on and after October 1, 1996, unless the
23 secretary determines a hardship exists and grants an extension allowing

11 custody and support rights on behalf of the child are assigned pursuant to
12 this section, the surrender of physical custody and the assignment shall
13 transfer, by operation of law, the child's support rights under the order to

24 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
25 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
26 payments received by the secretary in behalf of any person applying for,
27 receiving or having received such assistance. This limited power of
28 attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary approves the
29 application for aid and shall remain in effect until the assignment of
30 support rights has been terminated in full.
31 (e) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys or
32 state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted a
33 medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both are

35 granted to any person who is a citizen of the United States or who is an
36 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
37 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
38 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
39 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
40 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
41 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
42 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
43 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to
SB 158 12
1 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
2 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
3 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.
4 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
5 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint
6 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
7 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
8 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
9 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
10 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
11 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
12 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
13 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
14 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
15 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
16 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
17 of the legislature.
18 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
19 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
20 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
21 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
22 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
23 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
24 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
25 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
26 shall be considered an available resource unless:
27 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
28 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
29 (ii) the trust is funded:
30 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
31 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
32 or
33 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that
34 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
35 assistance.
36 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
37 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
38 security act.
39 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
40 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
41 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
42 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
43 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,
SB 158 13
1 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
2 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
3 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available
4 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
5 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed
6 prior to any services being provided;
7 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
8 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
9 nonlicensed individuals;
10 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
11 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
12 wage standards;
13 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
14 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
15 revenue agencies;
16 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
17 be paid after the services are rendered;
18 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
19 contract, agreement or accord; and
20 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
21 agreement or accord ceases.
22 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
23 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
24 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
25 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
26 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
27 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
28 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
29 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
30 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
31 Kansas uniform trust code.
32 (f) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
33 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-
34 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
35 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
36 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
37 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
38 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
39 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
40 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
41 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
42 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
43 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the
SB 158 14
1 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
2 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
3 outside the state voluntarily.
4 (g) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support and
5 limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased recipients. (1)
6 (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-787, and
7 amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after September
8 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare catastrophic coverage
9 act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for or receiving medical
10 assistance under a medical care plan in which federal funds are expended,
11 any accrued, present or future rights to support and any rights to payment
12 for medical care from a third party of an applicant or recipient and any
13 other family member for whom the applicant is applying shall be deemed
14 to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the state. The
15 assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date of approval
16 for such assistance without the requirement that any document be signed
17 by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving medical
18 assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
19 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact to perform the
20 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
21 or other negotiable instruments, representing payments received by the
22 secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
23 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
24 from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance and
25 shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full. The
26 assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third party
27 under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from directly
28 billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider has not
29 submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for payment.
30 Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to support
31 are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no other shall
32 be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments thereto,
33 except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be retained by
34 the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
35 Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to payment for
36 medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the secretary for
37 repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
38 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
39 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
40 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
41 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
42 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
43 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes
SB 158 15
1 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
2 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
3 under the provisions of subsection (e) is a claim against the property or
4 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
5 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,
6 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
7 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
8 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
9 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
10 individual under subsection (e) except after the death of the surviving
11 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
12 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
13 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
14 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
15 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
16 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
17 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e) is
18 a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
19 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
20 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
21 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
22 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
23 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
24 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
25 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
26 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
27 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
28 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
29 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
30 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery
31 program under this subsection.
32 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
33 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
34 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
35 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
36 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
37 the results therefrom:
38 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
39 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
40 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
41 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
42 defined by applicable law; and
43 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,
SB 158 16
1 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
2 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
3 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance
4 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
5 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had
6 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
7 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
8 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
9 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
10 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
11 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
12 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
13 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
14 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
15 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
16 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
17 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
18 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
19 the county subject to the lien.
20 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
21 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
22 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
23 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
24 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
25 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
26 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
27 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
28 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
29 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
30 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall
31 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
32 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
33 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or
34 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
35 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
36 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
37 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
38 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
39 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
40 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
41 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
42 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
43 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
SB 158 17
1 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
2 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
3 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to
4 dissolution of the lien.
5 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the
6 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
7 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
8 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
9 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
10 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
11 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
12 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
13 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
14 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
15 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
16 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
17 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
18 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
19 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
20 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
21 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
22 following events occur:
23 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
24 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
25 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
26 environment or the secretary's designee;
27 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
28 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
29 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
30 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee
31 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
32 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
33 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed
34 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
35 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
36 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
37 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
38 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
39 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
40 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
41 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
42 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
43 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's
SB 158 18
1 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
2 designee.
3 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and
4 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
5 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of
6 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
7 nullified pursuant to law.
8 (h) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children or
9 revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
10 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
11 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
12 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
13 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
14 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
15 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
16 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
17 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
18 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
19 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
20 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
21 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
22 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
23 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
24 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
25 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
26 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
27 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
28 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
29 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
30 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
31 (i) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired from
32 employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and regulations
33 of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a felony
34 conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or parole
35 imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
36 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
37 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
38 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
39 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
40 (j) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
41 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
42 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
43 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
SB 158 19
1 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
2 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
3 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate
4 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
5 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
6 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
7 (k) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance,
8 the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned, pursuant to
9 K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on behalf of the
10 state only accrued, present or future rights to support from any other
11 person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of
12 any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or
13 receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically become
14 effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid without the
15 requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or recipient. By
16 applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance, the
17 applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
18 secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
19 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
20 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
21 secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
22 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
23 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
24 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
25 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
26 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
27 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
28 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
29 (l) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash assistance
30 as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons receiving cash
31 assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash assistance shall be
32 established, subject to applicable federal law, by the secretary for children
33 and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under such program of drug
34 screening, the secretary for children and families shall order a drug
35 screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash assistance at any time
36 when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant for or recipient of
37 cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled
38 substance analog. The secretary for children and families may use any
39 information obtained by the secretary for children and families to
40 determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not
41 limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed appointments and
42 arrest or other police records, previous employment or application for
43 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug
SB 158 20
1 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a
2 controlled substance or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening
3 records of the applicant or recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled
4 substance or controlled substance analog.
5 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
6 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
7 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
8 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
9 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
10 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
11 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
12 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
13 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
14 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
15 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
16 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
17 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
18 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
19 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
20 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
21 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
22 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
23 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
24 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
25 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
26 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
27 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
28 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
29 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
30 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills
31 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
32 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
33 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third
34 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
35 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
36 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
37 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
38 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
39 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
40 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
41 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
42 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
43 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual
SB 158 21
1 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
2 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
3 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for
4 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
5 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or
6 controlled substance analog.
7 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
8 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
9 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
10 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
11 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
12 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
13 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
14 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
15 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
16 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
17 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
18 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
19 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
20 controlled substance analog.
21 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
22 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
23 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
24 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
25 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
26 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
27 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
28 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
29 of such additional drug screening.
30 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
31 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
32 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
33 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for
34 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
35 or legal guardian's minor child.
36 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
37 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
38 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
39 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog,
40 and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall
41 thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance under this
42 subsection unless such conviction is the person's first conviction. First-
43 time offenders convicted under federal or state law of any offense that is
SB 158 22
1 classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has as an element
2 of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution, possession or
3 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and the date
4 of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall become
5 ineligible to receive cash assistance for five years from the date of
6 conviction.
7 (6) Except for hearings before the Kansas department for children
8 and families, the results of any drug screening administered as part of the
9 drug screening program authorized by this subsection shall be confidential
10 and shall not be disclosed publicly.
11 (7) The secretary for children and families may adopt such rules and
12 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
13 (8) Any authority granted to the secretary for children and families

Raw Text:
Session of 2025
SENATE BILL No. 158
By Committee on Judiciary
2-3
1 AN ACT concerning social welfare; relating to the supplemental nutrition
2 assistance program; allowing persons with felony drug convictions to
3 receive assistance; amending K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 and repealing
4 the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 39-709. (a) General eligibility requirements for assistance for
9 which federal moneys are expended. Subject to the additional requirements
10 below, assistance in accordance with plans under which federal moneys
11 are expended may be granted to any needy person who:
12 (1) Has insufficient income or resources to provide a reasonable
13 subsistence compatible with decency and health. Where a husband and
14 wife or cohabiting partners are living together, the combined income or
15 resources of both shall be considered in determining the eligibility of
16 either or both for such assistance unless otherwise prohibited by law. The
17 secretary, in determining need of any applicant for or recipient of
18 assistance shall not take into account the financial responsibility of any
19 individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance unless such applicant
20 or recipient is such individual's spouse, cohabiting partner or such
21 individual's minor child or minor stepchild if the stepchild is living with
22 such individual. The secretary in determining need of an individual may
23 provide such income and resource exemptions as may be permitted by
24 federal law. For purposes of eligibility for temporary assistance for needy
25 families, for food assistance and for any other assistance provided through
26 the Kansas department for children and families under which federal
27 moneys are expended, the secretary for children and families shall
28 consider one motor vehicle owned by the applicant for assistance,
29 regardless of the value of such vehicle, as exempt personal property and
30 shall consider any equity in any boat, personal water craft, recreational
31 vehicle, recreational off-highway vehicle or all-terrain vehicle, as defined
32 by K.S.A. 8-126, and amendments thereto, or any additional motor vehicle
33 owned by the applicant for assistance to be a nonexempt resource of the
34 applicant for assistance except that any additional motor vehicle used by
35 the applicant, the applicant's spouse or the applicant's cohabiting partner
36 for the primary purpose of earning income may be considered as exempt

SB 158 2
1 personal property in the secretary's discretion; or
2 (2) is a citizen of the United States or is an alien lawfully admitted to
3 the United States and who is residing in the state of Kansas.
4 (b) Temporary assistance for needy families. Assistance may be
5 granted under this act to any dependent child, or relative, subject to the
6 general eligibility requirements as set out in subsection (a), who resides in
7 the state of Kansas or whose parent or other relative with whom the child
8 is living resides in the state of Kansas. Such assistance shall be known as
9 temporary assistance for needy families. Where the husband and wife or
10 cohabiting partners are living together, both shall register for work under
11 the program requirements for temporary assistance for needy families in
12 accordance with criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations
13 of the secretary.
14 (1) As used in this subsection, "family group" or "household" means
15 the applicant or recipient for TANF, child care subsidy or employment
16 services and all individuals living together in which there is a relationship
17 of legal responsibility or a qualifying caretaker relationship. This will
18 include a cohabiting boyfriend or girlfriend living with the person legally
19 responsible for the child. The family group shall not be eligible for TANF
20 if the family group contains at least one adult member who has received
21 TANF, including the federal TANF assistance received in any other state,
22 for 24 calendar months beginning on and after October 1, 1996, unless the
23 secretary determines a hardship exists and grants an extension allowing
24 receipt of TANF until the 36-month limit is reached. No extension beyond
25 36 months shall be granted. Hardship provisions for a recipient include:
26 (A) Is a caretaker of a disabled family member living in the
27 household;
28 (B) has a disability that precludes employment on a long-term basis
29 or requires substantial rehabilitation;
30 (C) needs a time limit extension to overcome the effects of domestic
31 violence or sexual assault;
32 (D) is involved with prevention and protection services and has an
33 open social service plan; or
34 (E) is determined by the 24th month to have an extreme hardship other
35 than what is designated in criteria listed in subparagraphs (A) through (D).
36 This determination will be made by the executive review team.
37 (2) All adults applying for TANF shall be required to complete a
38 work program assessment as specified by the Kansas department for
39 children and families, including those who have been disqualified for or
40 denied TANF due to non-cooperation, drug testing requirements or fraud.
41 Adults who are not otherwise eligible for TANF, such as ineligible aliens,
42 relative/non-relative caretakers and adults receiving supplemental security
43 income are not required to complete the assessment process. During the

SB 158 3
1 application processing period, applicants must complete at least one
2 module or its equivalent of the work program assessment to be considered
3 eligible for TANF benefits, unless good cause is found to be exempt from
4 the requirements. Good cause exemptions shall only include that the

17 conduct work program case management services to TANF recipients in a
18 timely manner and in full accordance with state law and agency policy.
19 (4) (A) TANF mandatory work program applicants and recipients
20 shall participate in work components that lead to competitive, integrated
21 employment. Components are defined by the federal government as being

24 households shall meet at least 30 hours of participation per week, at least
25 20 hours of which shall be primary and at least 10 hours may be secondary
26 components in one parent households where the youngest child is six years
27 of age or older. Participation hours shall be 55 hours in two parent
28 households, 35 hours per week if child care is not used. The maximum
29 assignment is 40 hours per week per individual. For two parent families to
30 meet the federal work participation rate, both parents shall participate in a
31 combined total of 55 hours per week, 50 hours of which shall be in
32 primary components, or one or both parents could be assigned a combined
33 total of 35 hours per week, 30 hours of which must be primary
34 components, if the Kansas department for children and families paid child
35 care is not received by the family. Single parent families with a child under
36 age six meet the federal participation requirement if the parent is engaged
37 in work or work activities for at least 20 hours per week in a primary work
38 component.
39 (C) The following components meet federal definitions of primary
40 hours of participation: Full or part-time employment, apprenticeship, work
41 study, self-employment, job corps, subsidized employment, work

3 of a high school diploma or GED.
4 (5) A parent or other adult caretaker personally providing care for a
5 child under the age of three months in their TANF household shall be
6 exempt from work participation activities until the month the child attains
7 three months of age. Such three-month limitation shall not apply to a
8 parent or other adult caretaker who is personally providing care for a child
9 born significantly premature, with serious medical conditions or with a
10 disability as defined by the secretary, in consultation with the secretary of
11 health and environment and adopted in the rules and regulations. The
12 three-month period is defined as two consecutive months starting with the
13 month after childbirth. The exemption for caring for a child under three
14 months cannot be claimed by:
15 (A) Either parent when two parents are in the home and the
16 household meets the two-parent definition for federal reporting purposes;
17 (B) one parent or caretaker when the other parent or caretaker is in
18 the home, and available, capable and suitable to provide care and the

24 with the fraud investigation. The Kansas department for children and
25 families shall maintain a sufficient level of fraud investigative staff to
26 enable the department to conduct fraud investigations in a timely manner
27 and in full accordance with state law and department rules and regulations
28 or policies.
29 (13) (A) Food assistance shall not be provided to any person
30 convicted of a felony offense occurring on or after July 1, 2015, that
31 includes as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation,

36 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
37 (B) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), an
38 individual shall be eligible for food assistance if the individual enrolls in

40 submits to and passes a drug test and agrees to submit to drug testing if
41 requested by the department pursuant to a drug testing plan.
42 (ii) An individual's failure to submit to testing or failure to
43 successfully pass a drug test shall result in ineligibility for food assistance

SB 158 7
1 until a drug test is successfully passed. Failure to successfully complete a

3 a drug treatment plan approved by the secretary is successfully completed,
4 the individual passes a drug test and agrees to submit to drug testing if
5 requested by the department pursuant to a drug testing plan.
6 (C) The provisions of subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any
7 individual who has been convicted for a second or subsequent felony
8 offense as provided in subparagraph (A) A person shall not be denied
9 food assistance solely because such person has been convicted of a drug-
10 related felony. The secretary for children and families shall submit to the
11 federal government any approval request required to implement the
12 provisions of this paragraph.
13 (14) No TANF cash assistance shall be used to purchase alcohol,
14 cigarettes, tobacco products, lottery tickets, concert tickets, professional or
15 collegiate sporting event tickets or tickets for other entertainment events

30 assistance, on any Kansas benefits card issued by the Kansas department
31 for children and families that the recipient uses in obtaining food, cash or
32 any other services. When a recipient of public assistance is a minor or
33 otherwise incapacitated individual, a parent or legal guardian of such
34 recipient may have a photograph of such parent or legal guardian placed
35 on the card.
36 (B) Any Kansas benefits card with a photograph of a recipient shall
37 be valid for voting purposes as a public assistance identification card in
38 accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments
39 thereto.
40 (C) As used in this paragraph and its subparagraphs, "Kansas benefits
41 card" means any card issued to provide food assistance, cash assistance or
42 child care assistance, including, but not limited to, the vision card, EBT
43 card and Kansas benefits card.

SB 158 8

2 recipient requests for a Kansas benefits card replacement and, upon the
3 fourth such request in a 12-month period, send a notice alerting the
4 recipient that the recipient's account is being monitored for potential
5 suspicious activity. If a recipient makes an additional request for
6 replacement subsequent to such notice, the department shall refer the
7 investigation to the department's fraud investigation unit.
8 (16) The secretary for children and families shall adopt rules and
9 regulations for:

36 as determined by United States department of agriculture. Non-citizen
37 individuals who are unable or unwilling to provide qualifying immigrant
38 documentation, as defined by the United States department of agriculture,
39 residing within a household shall not be included when determining the
40 household's size for the purposes of assigning a benefit level to the
41 household for food assistance or comparing the household's monthly
42 income with the income eligibility standards. The gross non-exempt
43 earned and unearned income and resources of disqualified individuals shall

SB 158 10
1 be counted in its entirety as available to the remaining household
2 members.
3 (19) The secretary for children and families shall not enact the state
4 option from the United States department of agriculture for broad-based
5 categorical eligibility for households applying for food assistance
6 according to the provisions of 7 C.F.R. § 273.2(j)(2)(ii).

13 income standards for food assistance higher than the standards specified in
14 7 U.S.C. § 2015(c) unless expressly required by federal law. Categorical
15 eligibility exempting households from such gross income standards
16 requirements shall not be granted for any non-cash, in-kind or other

35 with such winnings are receiving TANF cash assistance, food assistance or
36 assistance under the child care subsidy program and take appropriate
37 action. The Kansas department for children and families shall use data
38 received under this subsection solely, and for no other purpose, to
39 determine if any recipient's eligibility for benefits has been affected by
40 lottery prize winnings. The Kansas department for children and families
41 shall not publicly disclose the identity of any lottery prize winner,
42 including recipients who are determined to have illegally received
43 benefits.

SB 158 11
1 (d) Temporary assistance for needy families; assignment of support
2 rights and limited power of attorney. By applying for or receiving
3 temporary assistance for needy families such applicant or recipient shall be
4 deemed to have assigned to the secretary on behalf of the state any
5 accrued, present or future rights to support from any other person such
6 applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of any other
7 family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid. In
8 any case in which an order for child support has been established and the
9 legal custodian and obligee under the order surrenders physical custody of
10 the child to a caretaker relative without obtaining a modification of legal
11 custody and support rights on behalf of the child are assigned pursuant to
12 this section, the surrender of physical custody and the assignment shall
13 transfer, by operation of law, the child's support rights under the order to
14 the secretary on behalf of the state. Such assignment shall be of all
15 accrued, present or future rights to support of the child surrendered to the
16 caretaker relative. The assignment of support rights shall automatically
17 become effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid
18 without the requirement that any document be signed by the applicant,
19 recipient or obligee. By applying for or receiving temporary assistance for
20 needy families, or by surrendering physical custody of a child to a
21 caretaker relative who is an applicant or recipient of such assistance on the
22 child's behalf, the applicant, recipient or obligee is also deemed to have
23 appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact
24 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
25 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
26 payments received by the secretary in behalf of any person applying for,
27 receiving or having received such assistance. This limited power of
28 attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary approves the
29 application for aid and shall remain in effect until the assignment of
30 support rights has been terminated in full.
31 (e) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys or
32 state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted a
33 medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both are
34 expended, medical assistance in accordance with such plan shall be
35 granted to any person who is a citizen of the United States or who is an
36 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
37 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
38 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
39 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
40 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
41 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
42 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
43 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to

SB 158 12
1 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
2 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
3 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.
4 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
5 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint
6 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
7 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
8 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
9 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
10 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
11 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
12 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
13 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
14 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
15 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
16 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
17 of the legislature.
18 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
19 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
20 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
21 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
22 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
23 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
24 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
25 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
26 shall be considered an available resource unless:
27 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
28 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
29 (ii) the trust is funded:
30 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
31 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
32 or
33 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that
34 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
35 assistance.
36 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
37 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
38 security act.
39 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
40 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
41 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
42 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
43 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,

SB 158 13
1 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
2 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
3 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available
4 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
5 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed
6 prior to any services being provided;
7 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
8 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
9 nonlicensed individuals;
10 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
11 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
12 wage standards;
13 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
14 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
15 revenue agencies;
16 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
17 be paid after the services are rendered;
18 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
19 contract, agreement or accord; and
20 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
21 agreement or accord ceases.
22 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
23 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
24 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
25 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
26 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
27 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
28 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
29 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
30 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
31 Kansas uniform trust code.
32 (f) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
33 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-
34 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
35 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
36 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
37 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
38 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
39 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
40 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
41 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
42 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
43 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the

SB 158 14
1 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
2 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
3 outside the state voluntarily.
4 (g) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support and
5 limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased recipients. (1)
6 (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-787, and
7 amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after September
8 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare catastrophic coverage
9 act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for or receiving medical
10 assistance under a medical care plan in which federal funds are expended,
11 any accrued, present or future rights to support and any rights to payment
12 for medical care from a third party of an applicant or recipient and any
13 other family member for whom the applicant is applying shall be deemed
14 to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the state. The
15 assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date of approval
16 for such assistance without the requirement that any document be signed
17 by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving medical
18 assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
19 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact to perform the
20 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
21 or other negotiable instruments, representing payments received by the
22 secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
23 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
24 from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance and
25 shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full. The
26 assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third party
27 under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from directly
28 billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider has not
29 submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for payment.
30 Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to support
31 are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no other shall
32 be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments thereto,
33 except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be retained by
34 the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
35 Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to payment for
36 medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the secretary for
37 repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
38 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
39 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
40 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
41 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
42 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
43 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes

SB 158 15
1 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
2 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
3 under the provisions of subsection (e) is a claim against the property or
4 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
5 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,
6 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
7 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
8 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
9 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
10 individual under subsection (e) except after the death of the surviving
11 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
12 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
13 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
14 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
15 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
16 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
17 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e) is
18 a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
19 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
20 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
21 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
22 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
23 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
24 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
25 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
26 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
27 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
28 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
29 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
30 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery
31 program under this subsection.
32 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
33 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
34 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
35 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
36 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
37 the results therefrom:
38 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
39 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
40 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
41 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
42 defined by applicable law; and
43 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,

SB 158 16
1 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
2 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
3 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance
4 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
5 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had
6 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
7 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
8 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
9 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
10 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
11 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
12 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
13 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
14 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
15 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
16 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
17 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
18 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
19 the county subject to the lien.
20 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
21 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
22 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
23 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
24 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
25 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
26 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
27 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
28 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
29 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
30 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall
31 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
32 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
33 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or
34 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
35 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
36 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
37 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
38 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
39 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
40 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
41 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
42 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
43 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or

SB 158 17
1 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
2 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
3 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to
4 dissolution of the lien.
5 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the
6 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
7 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
8 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
9 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
10 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
11 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
12 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
13 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
14 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
15 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
16 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
17 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
18 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
19 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
20 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
21 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
22 following events occur:
23 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
24 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
25 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
26 environment or the secretary's designee;
27 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
28 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
29 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
30 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee
31 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
32 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
33 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed
34 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
35 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
36 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
37 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
38 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
39 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
40 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
41 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
42 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
43 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's

SB 158 18
1 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
2 designee.
3 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and
4 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
5 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of
6 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
7 nullified pursuant to law.
8 (h) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children or
9 revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
10 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
11 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
12 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
13 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
14 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
15 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
16 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
17 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
18 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
19 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
20 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
21 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
22 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
23 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
24 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
25 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
26 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
27 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
28 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
29 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
30 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.
31 (i) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired from
32 employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and regulations
33 of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a felony
34 conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or parole
35 imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
36 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
37 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
38 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
39 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
40 (j) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
41 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
42 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
43 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the

SB 158 19
1 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
2 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
3 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate
4 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
5 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
6 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
7 (k) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance,
8 the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned, pursuant to
9 K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on behalf of the
10 state only accrued, present or future rights to support from any other
11 person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of
12 any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or
13 receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically become
14 effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid without the
15 requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or recipient. By
16 applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food assistance, the
17 applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the secretary, or the
18 secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the specific act of
19 negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders or other
20 negotiable instruments representing support payments received by the
21 secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
22 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
23 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
24 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
25 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
26 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
27 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
28 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
29 (l) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash assistance
30 as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons receiving cash
31 assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash assistance shall be
32 established, subject to applicable federal law, by the secretary for children
33 and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under such program of drug
34 screening, the secretary for children and families shall order a drug
35 screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash assistance at any time
36 when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant for or recipient of
37 cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled
38 substance analog. The secretary for children and families may use any
39 information obtained by the secretary for children and families to
40 determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not
41 limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed appointments and
42 arrest or other police records, previous employment or application for
43 employment in an occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug

SB 158 20
1 screening, termination from previous employment due to unlawful use of a
2 controlled substance or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening
3 records of the applicant or recipient indicating unlawful use of a controlled
4 substance or controlled substance analog.
5 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
6 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
7 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
8 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
9 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
10 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
11 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
12 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
13 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
14 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
15 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
16 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
17 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
18 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
19 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
20 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
21 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
22 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
23 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
24 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
25 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
26 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
27 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
28 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
29 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
30 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills
31 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
32 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
33 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third
34 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
35 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
36 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
37 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
38 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
39 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
40 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
41 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
42 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
43 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual

SB 158 21
1 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
2 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
3 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for
4 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
5 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or
6 controlled substance analog.
7 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
8 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
9 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
10 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
11 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
12 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
13 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
14 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
15 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
16 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
17 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
18 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
19 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
20 controlled substance analog.
21 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
22 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
23 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
24 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
25 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
26 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
27 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
28 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
29 of such additional drug screening.
30 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance
31 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
32 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
33 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for
34 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
35 or legal guardian's minor child.
36 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
37 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
38 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
39 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog,
40 and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall
41 thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance under this
42 subsection unless such conviction is the person's first conviction. First-
43 time offenders convicted under federal or state law of any offense that is

SB 158 22
1 classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has as an element
2 of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution, possession or
3 use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and the date
4 of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall become
5 ineligible to receive cash assistance for five years from the date of
6 conviction.
7 (6) Except for hearings before the Kansas department for children
8 and families, the results of any drug screening administered as part of the
9 drug screening program authorized by this subsection shall be confidential
10 and shall not be disclosed publicly.
11 (7) The secretary for children and families may adopt such rules and
12 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection.
13 (8) Any authority granted to the secretary for children and families
14 under this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed
15 by law.
16 (9) As used in this subsection:
17 (A) "Cash assistance" means cash assistance provided to individuals
18 under the provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes
19 Annotated, and amendments thereto, and any rules and regulations adopted
20 pursuant to such provisions.
21 (B) "Controlled substance" means the same as in K.S.A. 21-5701, and
22 amendments thereto, and 21 U.S.C. § 802.
23 (C) "Controlled substance analog" means the same as in K.S.A. 21-
24 5701, and amendments thereto.
25 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 is hereby repealed.
26 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
27 publication in the statute book.
