27 under this section shall be confidential and shall not be divulged to any
28 person not authorized by this section or authorized in writing by the

26 amendments thereto, has assessed the juvenile as detention-eligible or
27 there are grounds to override the results of a detention risk assessment tool
28 and the court finds probable cause that:

20 protocol allows such placement.
21 (d) No person 18 years of age or more shall be placed in a juvenile
22 detention center.
23 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 38-2346 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-

16 a felony and, as a result of a plea agreement reached between the juvenile
17 and prosecuting attorney, the charge has been amended to a misdemeanor.
18 A juvenile who has participated in an immediate intervention program for
19 a previous misdemeanor may, but is not required to, be offered

17 intake and assessment worker, court services officer or community
18 corrections officer.
19 (e) "Summons" means a written order issued by an intake and
20 assessment worker or a law enforcement officer directing that a juvenile
21 appear before a designated court at a stated time and place to answer a

23 (f) A juvenile who is eligible for an immediate intervention shall not
24 be denied participation in such a program or terminated unsuccessfully due
25 to an inability to pay fees or other associated costs. Fees assessed from
26 such a program shall be retained by the program and shall not be used for
27 any purpose, except development and operation of the program No fees
28 or costs shall be imposed on a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or

42 Sec. 17. K.S.A. 38-2348 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
43 2348. (a) (1) For the purpose of this section, a person charged as a juvenile
SB 111 25
1 is incompetent for adjudication as a juvenile offender if, because of mental
2 illness or defect, such person is unable to:
3 (1)(A) Understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings; or
4 (2)(B) make or assist in making a defense.
5 (2) Whenever the words "competent," "competency," "incompetent"
6 and "incompetency" are used without qualification in this code, such
7 words shall refer to the standard for incompetency described in this
8 subsection.
9 (b) (1) If at any time after such person has been charged as a juvenile
10 there is reason to believe that the juvenile is incompetent for adjudication
11 as a juvenile offender, the proceedings shall be suspended and the court
12 before whom the case is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the
13 competency of the juvenile. Such a hearing may be held upon the motion
14 of the juvenile's attorney or the prosecuting attorney, or upon the court's
15 own motion.
16 (2) The court shall determine the issue of competency. To facilitate in
17 this determination, the court may: (A) Appoint a licensed psychiatrist or
18 psychologist to examine the juvenile; or (B) designate a private or public
19 mental health facility to conduct a psychiatric or psychological
20 examination and report to the court. If the examining psychiatrist,
21 psychologist or private or public mental health facility determines that
22 further examination is necessary, the court may commit the juvenile for not
23 more than 60 days to any appropriate public or private institution for
24 examination and report to the court. For good cause shown, the
25 commitment may be extended for another 60 days. No statement made by
26 the juvenile in the course of any examination provided for by this section,
27 whether the examination is with or without the consent of the juvenile,
28 shall be admitted in evidence against the juvenile in any hearing.
29 (3) Unless the court finds the attendance of the juvenile would be
30 injurious to the juvenile's health, the juvenile shall be present personally at
31 all proceedings under this section.
32 (c) If the juvenile is found to be competent, the proceedings which
33 have been suspended shall be resumed.
34 (d) If the juvenile is found to be incompetent, the juvenile shall
35 remain subject to the jurisdiction of the court and shall be committed for
36 evaluation and treatment pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2349 and 38-2350, and
37 amendments thereto. One or both parents of the juvenile may be ordered to
38 pay child support pursuant to the Kansas child support guidelines. Upon
39 application of the juvenile and in the discretion of the court, the juvenile
40 may be released to any appropriate private institution upon terms and
41 conditions prescribed by the court.
42 (e) If at any time after proceedings have been suspended under this
43 section, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a juvenile who has
SB 111 26
1 been adjudged incompetent is now competent, the court in which the case
2 is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the juvenile's present
3 mental condition. Reasonable notice of the hearings shall be given to the
4 prosecuting attorney, the juvenile and the juvenile's attorney of record, if
5 any. If the court, following the hearing, finds the juvenile to be competent,
6 the pending proceedings shall be resumed.
7 Sec. 18. K.S.A. 38-2360 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
8 2360. (a) At any time after the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a
9 juvenile offender, the court shall order one or more of the tools described

14 professional stating the psychological or emotional development or needs
15 of the juvenile. The court also may order a report from any mental health

17 the psychological or emotional development needs of the juvenile. If the
18 court orders an evaluation as provided in this section, a parent of the
19 juvenile shall have the right to obtain an independent evaluation at the
20 expense of no cost to the parent. If the evaluation indicates that the
21 juvenile requires acute inpatient mental health or substance abuse
22 treatment, the court shall have the authority to compel an assessment by
23 the secretary for aging and disability services. The court may use the
24 results to inform a treatment and payment plan according to the same
25 eligibility process used for non-court-involved youth. No juvenile or
26 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian shall be required to pay for
27 treatment ordered by the court pursuant to this section.
28 (2) A report of the medical condition and needs of the juvenile. The
29 court also may order a report from any physician who has been attending
30 the juvenile, stating the diagnosis, condition and treatment afforded the
31 juvenile.
32 (3) An educational needs assessment of the juvenile from the chief
33 administrative officer of the school which the juvenile attends or attended
34 to provide to the court information that is readily available which the

17 of corrections to be used in all judicial districts. The office of judicial
18 administration and the secretary of corrections shall establish cutoff scores
19 determining risk levels of juveniles. Training on such risk and needs
20 assessment shall be required for all administrators of the assessment. Data

33 (e) At any time prior to sentencing, the judge, at the request of a
34 party, shall hear additional evidence as to proposals for reasonable and
35 appropriate sentencing of the case.

26 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
27 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
28 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
29 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
30 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
31 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
32 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
33 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
34 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
35 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
36 the fee. In no event shall The fee shall not be assessed against the secretary
37 of corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be
38 assessed against the secretary of the department for children and families
39 or the Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
40 secretary's care, custody and control. The court shall not assess any fee for
41 the evaluation or program, including, but not limited to, any ongoing
42 required drug or alcohol testing, against the juvenile, the juvenile's parent,
43 guardian or custodian.
SB 111 31
1 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
2 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
3 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
4 provisions apply:
5 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
6 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
7 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
8 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
9 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
10 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
11 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
12 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
13 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
14 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
15 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
16 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
17 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
18 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
19 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
20 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
21 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
22 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
23 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
24 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
25 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
26 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
27 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
28 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
29 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
30 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
31 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
32 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
33 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
34 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
35 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
36 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
37 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
38 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
39 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
40 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
41 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
42 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
43 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
SB 111 32
1 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
2 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
3 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
4 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
5 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
6 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
7 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
8 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
9 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
10 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
11 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
12 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
13 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
14 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
15 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
16 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
17 conditions.
18 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
19 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
20 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
21 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
22 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
23 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
24 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
25 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
26 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
27 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
28 organizations performing services for the community; and
29 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
30 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
31 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
32 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
33 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
34 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
35 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
36 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
37 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
38 following provisions apply:
39 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
40 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
41 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
42 lump sum or installments;
43 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
SB 111 33
1 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
2 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
3 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
4 imposition of a fine; and
5 (3) any fine imposed by court shall be a judgment against the juvenile
6 that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other execution as on
7 judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the
8 termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
9 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
10 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
11 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
12 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
13 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
14 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
15 (g)(f) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
16 subsection (a)(11) (a)(9), the following provisions shall apply:
17 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
18 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
19 exhausted. The court shall not order commitment to detention for
20 nonpayment of any fine, fee cost or restitution, including in cases where
21 nonpayment constitutes a violation of sentencing conditions.
22 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
23 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
24 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
25 new felony offense, or violates conditional release. No such finding shall
26 be based in whole or in part on:
27 (A) Nonpayment of fines, fees, costs or other financial obligations by
28 the juvenile, the juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian; or
29 (B) a juvenile's noncompliance with any sentencing condition that
30 would require a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian to
31 pay money in order to comply.
32 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
33 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
34 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
35 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
36 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
37 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
38 days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
39 2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
40 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
41 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
42 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 days or
43 the overall case length limit.
SB 111 34
1 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
2 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
3 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
4 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
5 facility.
6 (h)(g) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be
7 in effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
8 (i)(h) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
9 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
10 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
11 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
12 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
13 within 30 days of final disposition.
14 (j)(i) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to be
15 a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult would
16 constitute the commission of: (1) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined
17 in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14
18 years of age; (2) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503(a)(3), and
19 amendments thereto; (3) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as

21 criminal sodomy, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5504(b)(1) or (b)(2), and
22 amendments thereto; (5) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as
23 defined in K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less
24 than 14 years of age; (6) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in
25 K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is
26 less than 14 years of age; or (7) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal
27 solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and
28 amendments thereto, of an offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (6);
29 the court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the
30 attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If only one
31 attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are eligible to
32 attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile reside, the
33 court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim, the juvenile,
34 their families and a representative of the school district as to why the
35 juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the attendance center
36 attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may issue an order
37 prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center that the
38 victim of the offense attends.
39 (k)(j) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
40 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
41 foster home or community integration program if:
42 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
43 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
SB 111 35
1 commission of:
2 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
3 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;

17 (2) (A) the victim resides in the same home as the juvenile offender;
18 (B) a community supervision officer in consultation with the
19 department for children and families determines that an adequate safety
20 plan, which shall include the physical and psychological well-being of the
21 victim, cannot be developed to keep the juvenile in the same home; and
22 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
23 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
24 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
25 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
26 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
27 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
28 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
29 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
30 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
31 initial order of the court.
32 (l)(k) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided
33 in K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.
34 (m)(l) The overall case length limit shall be calculated by the court
35 and entered into the written record when one or more of the sentencing
36 options under this section are imposed. The period fixed by the court
37 pursuant to subsection (a) shall not extend beyond the overall case length
38 limit.
39 Sec. 20. K.S.A. 38-2362 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
40 2362. (a) When sentencing a juvenile offender, the court may order a
41 juvenile offender's parent to participate in any evidence-based program
42 designed to rehabilitate the juvenile, including, but not limited to: (1)

3 (1) Upon entering an order requiring a juvenile offender's parent to
4 attend counseling sessions or mediation, the court shall give the parent
5 notice of the order. The notice shall inform the parent of the parent's right
6 to request a hearing within 14 days after entry of the order and the parent's
7 right to employ an attorney to represent the parent at the hearing or, if the
8 parent is financially unable to employ an attorney, the parent's right to
9 request the court to appoint an attorney to represent the parent.
10 (2) If the parent does not request a hearing within 14 days after entry
11 of the order, the order shall take effect at that time.
12 (3) If the parent requests a hearing, the court shall set the matter for
13 hearing and, if requested, shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent.
14 The expense and fees of the appointed attorney may be allowed and
15 assessed as provided by K.S.A. 38-2306, and amendments thereto.
16 (b) In addition to any other orders provided for by this section, The
17 parent of a juvenile offender may shall not be held responsible for the
18 costs of sanctions, including, but not limited to, the cost of a house arrest

21 offender as follows:
22 (1) The board of county commissioners of a county may provide by
23 resolution that the parent of any juvenile offender placed under a house
24 arrest program pursuant to subsection (a)(9) of K.S.A. 38-2361, and

29 (2) If child support has been requested and a parent has a duty to
30 support the juvenile offender, the court may order, and when custody is
31 placed with the commissioner shall order, one or both parents to pay child
32 support. The court shall determine, for each parent separately, whether the
33 parent already is subject to an order to pay support for the juvenile. If the

35 has personal jurisdiction over the parent, the court shall order the parent to
36 pay child support in an amount determined under K.S.A. 38-2319, and
37 amendments thereto. Except for good cause shown, the court shall issue an
38 immediate income withholding order pursuant to K.S.A. 23-3101 et seq.,
39 and amendments thereto, for each parent ordered to pay support under this
40 subsection, regardless of whether a payor has been identified for the
41 parent. A parent ordered to pay child support under this subsection shall be
42 notified, at the hearing or otherwise, that the child support order may be
43 registered pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2321, and amendments thereto. The
SB 111 37
1 parent also shall be informed that, after registration, the income
2 withholding order may be served on the parent's employer without further
3 notice to the parent and the child support order may be enforced by any
4 method allowed by law. Failure to provide this notice shall not affect the
5 validity of the child support order when placed out of the home.
6 Sec. 21. K.S.A. 38-2369 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
7 2369. (a) Except as provided in subsection (e) and K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13)
8 (a)(11), for the purpose of committing juvenile offenders to a juvenile

11 damage to property, the following placements shall be applied by the judge
12 in the cases specified in this subsection. If used, the court shall establish a
13 specific term of commitment as specified in this subsection. The term of
14 commitment established by the court shall not exceed the overall case
15 length limit. Before a juvenile offender is committed to a juvenile
16 correctional facility pursuant to this section, the court shall administer a

23 this category may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a
24 minimum term of 60 months and up to a maximum term of the offender

17 as high-risk on a risk and needs assessment. Offenders in this category
18 may be committed to a juvenile correctional facility for a minimum term
19 of six months and up to a maximum term of 12 months.
20 (3) Chronic Offenders. (A) The chronic offender I, chronic felon is

42 (1) Upon finding the juvenile violated a requirement or requirements
43 of conditional release, the court may enter one or more of the following
SB 111 39
1 orders:

12 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
13 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall
14 be classified as either a felony or a misdemeanor according to the

17 will be deemed a felony in Kansas. The state of Kansas shall classify the
18 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
19 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such
20 offense as person or nonperson, reference to comparable offenses shall be
21 made. If the state of Kansas does not have a comparable offense, the out-
22 of-state adjudication shall be classified as a nonperson offense.
23 (d) The secretary of corrections shall work with the community to
24 provide on-going support and incentives for the development of additional

28 chronic offender category and offenders at least 10 years of age but less
29 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
30 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
31 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. This
32 presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the record that the juvenile
33 offender poses a significant risk of physical harm to another.
34 Sec. 22. K.S.A. 38-2373 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
35 2373. (a) Actions by the court. (1) When a juvenile offender has been

5 facility and is required to go back to court for any reason, the county
6 demanding the juvenile's presence shall be responsible for transportation,

8 sheriff shall be responsible for all transportation, detention, custody and
9 control of such offender.

15 control to the department of corrections. The date of admission shall be no
16 more than five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays,
17 after the notice to the committing court. Until received at the designated
18 facility, the continuing detention, custody, and control of and transport for
19 a juvenile offender sentenced to a direct commitment to a juvenile
20 correctional facility shall be the responsibility of the committing county.
21 (2) Except as provided by K.S.A. 38-2332, and amendments thereto,
22 the secretary may make any temporary out-of-home placement the
23 secretary deems appropriate pending placement of the juvenile offender in
24 a juvenile correctional facility, and the secretary shall notify the court,
25 local law enforcement agency and school district in which the juvenile will
26 be residing if the juvenile is still required to attend a secondary school of
27 that placement.
28 (c) Transfers. During the time a juvenile offender remains committed
29 to a juvenile correctional facility, the secretary may transfer the juvenile
30 offender from one juvenile correctional facility to another.
31 (d) Case planning. For all juveniles committed to a juvenile
32 correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(11)(a)(10), and
33 amendments thereto, a case plan shall be developed with input from the
34 juvenile and the juvenile's family. For all those committed upon violation
35 of a condition of sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments
36 thereto, the case plan developed with the juvenile's community supervision
37 officer shall be revised to reflect the new disposition. The department for
38 children and families, the local school district in which the juvenile
39 offender will be residing and community supervision officers may also
40 participate in the development or revision of the case plan when
41 appropriate. The case plan shall incorporate the results of the risk and
42 needs assessment, the programs and education to complete while in
43 custody and shall clearly define the role of each person or agency working
SB 111 41
1 with the juvenile. The case plan shall include a reentry section, detailing
2 services, education, supervision or any other elements necessary for a
3 successful transition. The reentry section of the case plan shall also include
4 information on reintegration of the juvenile into such juvenile's family or,
5 if reintegration is not a viable alternative, another viable release option. If
6 the juvenile is to be placed on conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
7 2369, the case plan shall be developed with the community supervision
8 officer.
9 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 38-2384 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
10 2384. When an appeal is taken pursuant to this code, fees of an attorney
11 appointed to represent the juvenile offender shall be fixed by the district
12 court. The fees, together with the costs of transcripts and records on
13 appeal, shall be taxed as expenses on appeal paid from the county general
14 fund and shall not be subject to reimbursement by the juvenile or the
15 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian. The court on appeal may assess
16 the fees and expenses against the appealing party or order that they be paid
17 from the county general fund. When the court orders the fees and expenses
18 assessed against the appealing party:
19 (a) The fees and expenses shall be paid from the county general fund,
20 subject to reimbursement by the appealing party; and
21 (b) the county may enforce the order as a civil judgment, except the
22 county shall not be required to pay the docket fee or fee for execution.
23 Sec. 24. K.S.A. 38-2389 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
24 2389. (a) Findings and purpose. The following findings and declaration of
25 purpose apply to this section.
26 (1) The legislature finds that personal and familial circumstances may
27 contribute to the commission of offenses by juveniles who represent a
28 minimal threat to public safety and that in such cases it would further the
29 interests of society and the juvenile to take an approach to adjudication
30 that combines less formal procedures, appropriate disciplinary sanctions
31 for misconduct and the provision of necessary services.
32 (2) It is the purpose of this section to provide prosecutors with an
33 alternative means of adjudication for juvenile offenders who present a
34 minimal threat to public safety and both the juvenile and society would
35 benefit from such approach.
36 (b) Designation. A county or district attorney with jurisdiction over
37 the offense who believes that proceedings under this section are
38 appropriate may, in such county or district attorney's discretion, designate
39 any alleged juvenile offender for adjudication under this section and not
40 seek application of a placement within the placement matrix pursuant to
41 K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto, if the alleged juvenile has fewer
42 than two prior adjudications.
43 (1) The county or district attorney shall make such designation in the
SB 111 42
1 original complaint or by written notice filed with the court and served on
2 the juvenile, the juvenile's counsel and the juvenile's parent or legal
3 guardian within 14 days after the filing of the complaint.
4 (2) The filing of a written application for immediate intervention
5 under K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, shall toll the running of
6 the 14-day period and shall resume upon the issuance of a written denial of
7 diversion.
8 (3) If the county or district attorney makes such designation, the
9 juvenile may be referred to an immediate intervention program established
10 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, and in compliance
11 with the standards and procedures developed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2396,
12 and amendments thereto.
13 (c) Exceptions. Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions
14 of the revised Kansas juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301 et seq., and
15 amendments thereto, shall apply in any adjudication under this section.
16 (1) If during the proceedings the court determines that there is
17 probable cause to believe that the juvenile is a child in need of care as
18 defined by K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto, the court shall refer
19 the matter to the county or district attorney, who shall file a petition as
20 provided in K.S.A. 38-2234, and amendments thereto, and refer the family
21 to the Kansas department for children and families for services. If the child
22 in need of care case is presided over by a different judge, the county or
23 district attorney shall notify the court presiding over the proceedings under
24 this section of pertinent orders entered in the child in need of care case.
25 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no juvenile shall be
26 committed to a juvenile correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)
27 (11)(a)(10), and amendments thereto, for an offense adjudicated under this
28 section or for the violation of a term or condition of the disposition for
29 such an offense.
30 (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjudication under
31 this section or violation of the terms and conditions of the disposition shall
32 be used against the juvenile in a proceeding on a subsequent offense
33 committed as a juvenile or as an adult. For purposes of this section, ''used
34 against the juvenile'' includes, but is not limited to, establishing an element
35 of a subsequent offense, raising the severity level of a subsequent offense
36 or enhancing the sentence for a subsequent offense.
37 (4) Upon completion of the case and the termination of the court's
38 jurisdiction, the court shall order the adjudication expunged, and the
39 provisions of K.S.A. 38-2312(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), (k) and (l), and
40 amendments thereto, shall not apply to such expungement.
41 (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a juvenile shall not
42 be required to register as an offender under the Kansas offender
43 registration act, K.S.A. 22-4901 et seq., and amendments thereto, as a
SB 111 43
1 result of adjudication under this section.
2 (6) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2309 and 38-2310, and amendments
3 thereto, shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
4 (7) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2347, and amendments thereto, shall
5 not apply to proceedings under this section.
6 (8) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2304(g)(1), and amendments thereto,
7 shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
8 (9) The trial of offenses under this section shall be to the court and
9 the right to a trial by jury under K.S.A. 38-2357, and amendments thereto,
10 shall not apply.
11 (d) Withdrawal. At any time prior to the beginning of a hearing at
12 which the court may enter an order adjudicating the child as a juvenile
13 offender, the county or district attorney may withdraw the designation for
14 proceedings under this section by providing notice to the court, the
15 juvenile, the juvenile's attorney and guardian ad litem, if any, and the
16 juvenile's parent or legal guardian. Upon withdrawal of the designation,
17 this section shall no longer apply and the case shall proceed and the court
18 shall grant a continuance upon request.
19 (e) Appeal. An adjudication under this section is an appealable order
20 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2380, and amendments thereto.
21 (f) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the revised
22 Kansas juvenile justice code.
23 Sec. 25. K.S.A. 38-2396 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
24 2396. (a) When a juvenile is placed outside the juvenile's home at a
25 dispositional hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(k)(j), and amendments
26 thereto, and no reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the
27 hearing, a written reintegration plan shall be prepared and submitted to the
28 court within 15 days of the initial order of the court.
29 (b) The plan shall be prepared by the person who has custody or, if
30 directed by the court, by a community supervision officer.
31 (c) If there is a lack of agreement among persons necessary for the
32 success of the plan, the person or entity having custody of the child shall
33 notify the court, and the court shall set a hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
34 2367, and amendments thereto.
35 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
36 Kansas juvenile justice code.
37 (e) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2017.
38 Sec. 26. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
39 2399. (a) The secretary of corrections may contract for use of not more
40 than 50 non-foster home beds in youth residential facilities for placement
41 of juvenile offenders pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13)(a)(11), and
42 amendments thereto.
43 (b) When contracting for services, the secretary shall:
SB 111 44
1 (1) Contract with facilities that have high success rates and decrease
2 recidivism rates for juvenile offenders;
3 (2) consider contracting for bed space across the entire state to lower
4 the cost of transportation of juvenile offenders; and
5 (3) give priority to existing facilities that are able to meet the
6 requirements of the secretary for providing residential services to juvenile
7 offenders.
8 (c) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2018.
9 Sec. 27. K.S.A. 75-724 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-724.
10 (a) Any person convicted or adjudicated of an offense that, pursuant to
11 K.S.A. 21-2511, and amendments thereto, requires submission of a DNA
12 sample upon arrest, charging or placement in custody, shall pay a separate
13 court cost of $200 as a Kansas bureau of investigation DNA database fee
14 upon conviction or adjudication.
15 (b) The court shall order such fees regardless of whether the person's
16 DNA sample was already on file with the Kansas bureau of investigation
17 at the time such person was arrested, charged or placed in custody, unless
18 the person can prove to the court that the person: (1) Has paid such fees in
19 connection with a prior conviction or adjudication; and (2) did not submit
20 specimens of blood or an oral or other biological sample authorized by the
21 Kansas bureau of investigation to the Kansas bureau of investigation for
22 the current offense of conviction or adjudication.
23 (c) The court shall not lessen or waive such fees unless the court has
24 determined such person is indigent and the basis for the court's
25 determination is reflected in the court's order.
26 (d) Such fees shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any
27 and all fines and penalties otherwise provided for by law for such offense.
28 (e) Disbursements from the Kansas bureau of investigation DNA
29 database fee deposited into the DNA database fee fund of the Kansas
30 bureau of investigation shall be made for the following:
31 (1) Providing DNA laboratory services;
32 (2) the purchase and maintenance of equipment for use by the
33 laboratory in performing DNA analysis; and
34 (3) education, training and scientific development of Kansas bureau
35 of investigation personnel regarding DNA analysis.
36 (f) Expenditures from the DNA database fee fund shall be made upon
37 warrants of the director of accounts and reports issued pursuant to
38 vouchers approved by the attorney general or by a person or persons
39 designated by the attorney general.
40 (g) All fees shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with
41 the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt
42 of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount
43 in the state treasury to the credit of the DNA database fee fund, which is
SB 111 45
1 hereby established in the state treasury.
2 (h) Fees received into this fund shall be supplemental to regular
3 appropriations to the Kansas bureau of investigation.
4 (i) The fee required by this section shall not be assessed to a juvenile
5 who is being adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense that requires
6 submission of a DNA sample or to such juvenile's parent, guardian or

24 presence at the treatment facility and the expected duration of the
25 treatment;
26 (k) submit to the taking of an updated photograph by the registering
27 law enforcement agency on each occasion when the offender registers with

30 employment or attends school. In addition, such offender shall submit to
31 the taking of a photograph to document any changes in identifying
32 characteristics, including, but not limited to, scars, marks and tattoos;
33 (l) remit payment to the sheriff's office in the amount of $20 as part of
34 the reporting process required pursuant to subsection (b) in each county in
35 which the offender resides, maintains employment or is attending school.
36 Registration will be completed regardless of whether or not the offender
37 remits payment. Failure of the offender to remit full payment within 15
38 days of registration is a violation of the Kansas offender registration act

12 alleged offender or if the person charged with the offense stated to law
13 enforcement officers that such person has an infectious disease or is
14 infected with an infectious disease, or used words of like effect, the court
15 shall order the person charged with the offense to submit to infectious
16 disease tests.

42 Sec. 17. K.S.A. 38-2348 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
43 2348. (a) (1) For the purpose of this section, a person charged as a juvenile

SB 111 25
1 is incompetent for adjudication as a juvenile offender if, because of mental
2 illness or defect, such person is unable to:
3 (1)(A) Understand the nature and purpose of the proceedings; or
4 (2)(B) make or assist in making a defense.
5 (2) Whenever the words "competent," "competency," "incompetent"
6 and "incompetency" are used without qualification in this code, such
7 words shall refer to the standard for incompetency described in this
8 subsection.
9 (b) (1) If at any time after such person has been charged as a juvenile
10 there is reason to believe that the juvenile is incompetent for adjudication
11 as a juvenile offender, the proceedings shall be suspended and the court
12 before whom the case is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the
13 competency of the juvenile. Such a hearing may be held upon the motion
14 of the juvenile's attorney or the prosecuting attorney, or upon the court's
15 own motion.
16 (2) The court shall determine the issue of competency. To facilitate in
17 this determination, the court may: (A) Appoint a licensed psychiatrist or
18 psychologist to examine the juvenile; or (B) designate a private or public
19 mental health facility to conduct a psychiatric or psychological
20 examination and report to the court. If the examining psychiatrist,
21 psychologist or private or public mental health facility determines that
22 further examination is necessary, the court may commit the juvenile for not
23 more than 60 days to any appropriate public or private institution for
24 examination and report to the court. For good cause shown, the
25 commitment may be extended for another 60 days. No statement made by
26 the juvenile in the course of any examination provided for by this section,
27 whether the examination is with or without the consent of the juvenile,
28 shall be admitted in evidence against the juvenile in any hearing.

30 injurious to the juvenile's health, the juvenile shall be present personally at
31 all proceedings under this section.
32 (c) If the juvenile is found to be competent, the proceedings which
33 have been suspended shall be resumed.
34 (d) If the juvenile is found to be incompetent, the juvenile shall
35 remain subject to the jurisdiction of the court and shall be committed for
36 evaluation and treatment pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2349 and 38-2350, and
37 amendments thereto. One or both parents of the juvenile may be ordered to
38 pay child support pursuant to the Kansas child support guidelines. Upon
39 application of the juvenile and in the discretion of the court, the juvenile
40 may be released to any appropriate private institution upon terms and
41 conditions prescribed by the court.
42 (e) If at any time after proceedings have been suspended under this
43 section, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a juvenile who has

SB 111 26
1 been adjudged incompetent is now competent, the court in which the case
2 is pending shall conduct a hearing to determine the juvenile's present
3 mental condition. Reasonable notice of the hearings shall be given to the
4 prosecuting attorney, the juvenile and the juvenile's attorney of record, if
5 any. If the court, following the hearing, finds the juvenile to be competent,
6 the pending proceedings shall be resumed.

14 professional stating the psychological or emotional development or needs
15 of the juvenile. The court also may order a report from any mental health

18 court orders an evaluation as provided in this section, a parent of the
19 juvenile shall have the right to obtain an independent evaluation at the
20 expense of no cost to the parent. If the evaluation indicates that the
21 juvenile requires acute inpatient mental health or substance abuse
22 treatment, the court shall have the authority to compel an assessment by
23 the secretary for aging and disability services. The court may use the
24 results to inform a treatment and payment plan according to the same
25 eligibility process used for non-court-involved youth. No juvenile or
26 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian shall be required to pay for
27 treatment ordered by the court pursuant to this section.
28 (2) A report of the medical condition and needs of the juvenile. The

32 (3) An educational needs assessment of the juvenile from the chief
33 administrative officer of the school which the juvenile attends or attended

25 residential facility shall only be permitted as authorized in K.S.A. 38-
26 2369(e), and amendments thereto. If the court elects, a period of
27 conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
28 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
29 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
30 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
31 facility, the secretary of corrections or designee shall notify the court of the
32 juvenile's anticipated release date. This alternative may be ordered with the
33 alternative in paragraph (7). Requirements pertaining to child support shall
34 apply under this alternative.
35 (13)(11) Upon a finding by the trier of fact during adjudication that a
36 firearm was used in the commission of an offense by the accused which, if
37 committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, a judge may commit the
38 juvenile directly to the custody of the secretary of corrections for
39 placement in a juvenile correctional facility or youth residential facility for
40 a minimum term of six months and up to a maximum term of 18 months,
41 regardless of the risk level of such juvenile as determined by a risk and
42 needs assessment. If the juvenile is committed to the custody of the
43 secretary, and the court elects, a period of conditional release, pursuant to

SB 111 30
1 K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto, may also be ordered. The period
2 of conditional release shall be limited to a maximum of six months and
3 shall be subject to graduated responses. Twenty-one days prior to the
4 juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional facility or youth residential
5 facility, the secretary of corrections or the secretary's designee shall notify
6 the court of the juvenile's anticipated release date.
7 (b) If the court orders the juvenile to attend counseling, educational,
8 mediation or other sessions, or to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation
9 pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the following provisions apply:
10 (1) The court may order the juvenile offender to participate in
11 counseling or mediation sessions or a program of education, including
12 placement in an alternative educational program approved by a local
13 school board. The costs of any counseling or mediation may shall not be
14 assessed as expenses in the case. No mental health center shall charge a fee
15 for court-ordered counseling greater than what the center would have
16 charged the person receiving the counseling if the person had requested
17 counseling on the person's own initiative. No mediator shall charge a fee
18 for court-ordered mediation greater than what the mediator would have
19 charged the person participating in the mediation if the person had
20 requested mediation on the person's own initiative. Mediation may include
21 the victim but shall not be mandatory for the victim; and
22 (2) if the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile by reason of a
23 violation of a statute that makes such a requirement, the court shall order
24 and, if adjudicated for any other offense, the court may order the juvenile
25 to submit to and complete a drug and alcohol evaluation by a community-
26 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
27 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
28 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
29 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
30 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
31 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
32 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
33 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
34 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
35 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
36 the fee. In no event shall The fee shall not be assessed against the secretary
37 of corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be
38 assessed against the secretary of the department for children and families
39 or the Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
40 secretary's care, custody and control. The court shall not assess any fee for
41 the evaluation or program, including, but not limited to, any ongoing
42 required drug or alcohol testing, against the juvenile, the juvenile's parent,
43 guardian or custodian.

SB 111 31
1 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
2 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
3 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
4 provisions apply:
5 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
6 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
7 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
8 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
9 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
10 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
11 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
12 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
13 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
14 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
15 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
16 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
17 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
18 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
19 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
20 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
21 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
22 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
23 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
24 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
25 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
26 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
27 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
28 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
29 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
30 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
31 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
32 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
33 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
34 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
35 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
36 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
37 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
38 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
39 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
40 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
41 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
42 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
43 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's

SB 111 32
1 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
2 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
3 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
4 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
5 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
6 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
7 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
8 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
9 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
10 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
11 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
12 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
13 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
14 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
15 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
16 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
17 conditions.
18 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
19 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
20 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
21 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
22 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
23 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
24 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
25 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
26 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
27 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
28 organizations performing services for the community; and
29 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
30 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
31 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
32 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
33 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
34 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
35 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
36 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
37 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
38 following provisions apply:
39 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
40 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
41 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
42 lump sum or installments;
43 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be

SB 111 33
1 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
2 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
3 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
4 imposition of a fine; and
5 (3) any fine imposed by court shall be a judgment against the juvenile
6 that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other execution as on
7 judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the
8 termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
9 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
10 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
11 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
12 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
13 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
14 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
15 (g)(f) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
16 subsection (a)(11) (a)(9), the following provisions shall apply:
17 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
18 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
19 exhausted. The court shall not order commitment to detention for
20 nonpayment of any fine, fee cost or restitution, including in cases where
21 nonpayment constitutes a violation of sentencing conditions.
22 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
23 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
24 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
25 new felony offense, or violates conditional release. No such finding shall
26 be based in whole or in part on:
27 (A) Nonpayment of fines, fees, costs or other financial obligations by
28 the juvenile, the juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian; or
29 (B) a juvenile's noncompliance with any sentencing condition that
30 would require a juvenile or a juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian to
31 pay money in order to comply.
32 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
33 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
34 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
35 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
36 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
37 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
38 days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
39 2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
40 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
41 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
42 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 days or
43 the overall case length limit.

SB 111 34
1 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
2 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
3 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
4 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
5 facility.
6 (h)(g) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be
7 in effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
8 (i)(h) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
9 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
10 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
11 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
12 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
13 within 30 days of final disposition.
14 (j)(i) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to be
15 a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult would
16 constitute the commission of: (1) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined
17 in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14
18 years of age; (2) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503(a)(3), and
19 amendments thereto; (3) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as

25 K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is

27 solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and
28 amendments thereto, of an offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (6);
29 the court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the
30 attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If only one
31 attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are eligible to
32 attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile reside, the
33 court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim, the juvenile,
34 their families and a representative of the school district as to why the
35 juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the attendance center
36 attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may issue an order
37 prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center that the
38 victim of the offense attends.
39 (k)(j) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
40 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
41 foster home or community integration program if:
42 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
43 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the

SB 111 35

2 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
3 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;

25 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
26 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
27 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
28 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
29 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
30 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
31 initial order of the court.
32 (l)(k) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided
33 in K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.

40 2362. (a) When sentencing a juvenile offender, the court may order a

11 of the order, the order shall take effect at that time.
12 (3) If the parent requests a hearing, the court shall set the matter for
13 hearing and, if requested, shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent.

6 (C) Revoke or restrict the juvenile's driving privileges as described in
7 K.S.A. 38-2361(c), and amendments thereto.
8 (2) Discharge the offender from the custody of the secretary of
9 corrections, release the secretary of corrections from further
10 responsibilities in the case and enter any other appropriate orders.
11 (c) As used in this section "adjudication" includes out-of-state
12 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
13 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall
14 be classified as either a felony or a misdemeanor according to the
15 adjudicating jurisdiction. If an offense which if committed by an adult
16 would constitute the commission of a felony is a felony in another state, it
17 will be deemed a felony in Kansas. The state of Kansas shall classify the
18 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
19 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such
20 offense as person or nonperson, reference to comparable offenses shall be
21 made. If the state of Kansas does not have a comparable offense, the out-
22 of-state adjudication shall be classified as a nonperson offense.
23 (d) The secretary of corrections shall work with the community to
24 provide on-going support and incentives for the development of additional
25 evidence-based community practices and programs to ensure that the
26 juvenile correctional facility is not frequently utilized.
27 (e) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all offenders in the
28 chronic offender category and offenders at least 10 years of age but less
29 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
30 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
31 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. This
32 presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the record that the juvenile
33 offender poses a significant risk of physical harm to another.
34 Sec. 22. K.S.A. 38-2373 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
35 2373. (a) Actions by the court. (1) When a juvenile offender has been
36 committed to a juvenile correctional facility, the clerk of the court shall
37 promptly notify the secretary of corrections of the commitment and
38 provide the secretary with a certified copy of the complaint, the journal
39 entry of the adjudication and sentencing. The court shall provide those
40 items from the social file which could relate to a rehabilitative program. If
41 the court wishes to recommend placement of the juvenile offender in a
42 specific juvenile correctional facility, the recommendation shall be
43 included in the sentence. After the court has received notice of the juvenile

SB 111 40
1 correctional facility designated as provided in subsection (b), it shall be the
2 duty of the court or the sheriff of the county to deliver the juvenile
3 offender to the facility at the time designated by the secretary.
4 (2) When a juvenile offender is residing in a juvenile correctional
5 facility and is required to go back to court for any reason, the county
6 demanding the juvenile's presence shall be responsible for transportation,
7 detention, custody and control of such offender. In these cases, the county
8 sheriff shall be responsible for all transportation, detention, custody and
9 control of such offender.
10 (b) Actions by the secretary. (1) Within three days, excluding
11 Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, after receiving notice of
12 commitment as provided in subsection (a), the secretary shall notify the
13 committing court of the facility to which the juvenile offender should be
14 conveyed, and when to effect the immediate transfer of custody and
15 control to the department of corrections. The date of admission shall be no
16 more than five days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays,
17 after the notice to the committing court. Until received at the designated
18 facility, the continuing detention, custody, and control of and transport for
19 a juvenile offender sentenced to a direct commitment to a juvenile
20 correctional facility shall be the responsibility of the committing county.
21 (2) Except as provided by K.S.A. 38-2332, and amendments thereto,
22 the secretary may make any temporary out-of-home placement the
23 secretary deems appropriate pending placement of the juvenile offender in
24 a juvenile correctional facility, and the secretary shall notify the court,
25 local law enforcement agency and school district in which the juvenile will
26 be residing if the juvenile is still required to attend a secondary school of
27 that placement.
28 (c) Transfers. During the time a juvenile offender remains committed
29 to a juvenile correctional facility, the secretary may transfer the juvenile
30 offender from one juvenile correctional facility to another.
31 (d) Case planning. For all juveniles committed to a juvenile
32 correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(11)(a)(10), and
33 amendments thereto, a case plan shall be developed with input from the
34 juvenile and the juvenile's family. For all those committed upon violation
35 of a condition of sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments
36 thereto, the case plan developed with the juvenile's community supervision
37 officer shall be revised to reflect the new disposition. The department for
38 children and families, the local school district in which the juvenile
39 offender will be residing and community supervision officers may also
40 participate in the development or revision of the case plan when
41 appropriate. The case plan shall incorporate the results of the risk and
42 needs assessment, the programs and education to complete while in
43 custody and shall clearly define the role of each person or agency working

SB 111 41
1 with the juvenile. The case plan shall include a reentry section, detailing
2 services, education, supervision or any other elements necessary for a
3 successful transition. The reentry section of the case plan shall also include
4 information on reintegration of the juvenile into such juvenile's family or,
5 if reintegration is not a viable alternative, another viable release option. If
6 the juvenile is to be placed on conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
7 2369, the case plan shall be developed with the community supervision
8 officer.
9 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 38-2384 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
10 2384. When an appeal is taken pursuant to this code, fees of an attorney
11 appointed to represent the juvenile offender shall be fixed by the district
12 court. The fees, together with the costs of transcripts and records on
13 appeal, shall be taxed as expenses on appeal paid from the county general
14 fund and shall not be subject to reimbursement by the juvenile or the
15 juvenile's parent, guardian or custodian. The court on appeal may assess
16 the fees and expenses against the appealing party or order that they be paid
17 from the county general fund. When the court orders the fees and expenses
18 assessed against the appealing party:
19 (a) The fees and expenses shall be paid from the county general fund,
20 subject to reimbursement by the appealing party; and
21 (b) the county may enforce the order as a civil judgment, except the
22 county shall not be required to pay the docket fee or fee for execution.
23 Sec. 24. K.S.A. 38-2389 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
24 2389. (a) Findings and purpose. The following findings and declaration of
25 purpose apply to this section.
26 (1) The legislature finds that personal and familial circumstances may
27 contribute to the commission of offenses by juveniles who represent a
28 minimal threat to public safety and that in such cases it would further the
29 interests of society and the juvenile to take an approach to adjudication
30 that combines less formal procedures, appropriate disciplinary sanctions
31 for misconduct and the provision of necessary services.
32 (2) It is the purpose of this section to provide prosecutors with an
33 alternative means of adjudication for juvenile offenders who present a
34 minimal threat to public safety and both the juvenile and society would
35 benefit from such approach.
36 (b) Designation. A county or district attorney with jurisdiction over
37 the offense who believes that proceedings under this section are
38 appropriate may, in such county or district attorney's discretion, designate
39 any alleged juvenile offender for adjudication under this section and not
40 seek application of a placement within the placement matrix pursuant to
41 K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto, if the alleged juvenile has fewer
42 than two prior adjudications.
43 (1) The county or district attorney shall make such designation in the

SB 111 42
1 original complaint or by written notice filed with the court and served on
2 the juvenile, the juvenile's counsel and the juvenile's parent or legal
3 guardian within 14 days after the filing of the complaint.
4 (2) The filing of a written application for immediate intervention
5 under K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, shall toll the running of
6 the 14-day period and shall resume upon the issuance of a written denial of
7 diversion.
8 (3) If the county or district attorney makes such designation, the
9 juvenile may be referred to an immediate intervention program established
10 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto, and in compliance
11 with the standards and procedures developed pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2396,
12 and amendments thereto.
13 (c) Exceptions. Except as provided in this subsection, the provisions
14 of the revised Kansas juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301 et seq., and
15 amendments thereto, shall apply in any adjudication under this section.
16 (1) If during the proceedings the court determines that there is
17 probable cause to believe that the juvenile is a child in need of care as
18 defined by K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto, the court shall refer
19 the matter to the county or district attorney, who shall file a petition as
20 provided in K.S.A. 38-2234, and amendments thereto, and refer the family
21 to the Kansas department for children and families for services. If the child
22 in need of care case is presided over by a different judge, the county or
23 district attorney shall notify the court presiding over the proceedings under
24 this section of pertinent orders entered in the child in need of care case.
25 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no juvenile shall be
26 committed to a juvenile correctional facility pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)
27 (11)(a)(10), and amendments thereto, for an offense adjudicated under this
28 section or for the violation of a term or condition of the disposition for
29 such an offense.
30 (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no adjudication under
31 this section or violation of the terms and conditions of the disposition shall
32 be used against the juvenile in a proceeding on a subsequent offense
33 committed as a juvenile or as an adult. For purposes of this section, ''used
34 against the juvenile'' includes, but is not limited to, establishing an element
35 of a subsequent offense, raising the severity level of a subsequent offense
36 or enhancing the sentence for a subsequent offense.
37 (4) Upon completion of the case and the termination of the court's
38 jurisdiction, the court shall order the adjudication expunged, and the
39 provisions of K.S.A. 38-2312(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (i), (k) and (l), and
40 amendments thereto, shall not apply to such expungement.
41 (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a juvenile shall not
42 be required to register as an offender under the Kansas offender
43 registration act, K.S.A. 22-4901 et seq., and amendments thereto, as a

SB 111 43
1 result of adjudication under this section.
2 (6) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2309 and 38-2310, and amendments
3 thereto, shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
4 (7) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2347, and amendments thereto, shall
5 not apply to proceedings under this section.
6 (8) The provisions of K.S.A. 38-2304(g)(1), and amendments thereto,
7 shall not apply to proceedings under this section.
8 (9) The trial of offenses under this section shall be to the court and
9 the right to a trial by jury under K.S.A. 38-2357, and amendments thereto,
10 shall not apply.
11 (d) Withdrawal. At any time prior to the beginning of a hearing at
12 which the court may enter an order adjudicating the child as a juvenile
13 offender, the county or district attorney may withdraw the designation for
14 proceedings under this section by providing notice to the court, the
15 juvenile, the juvenile's attorney and guardian ad litem, if any, and the
16 juvenile's parent or legal guardian. Upon withdrawal of the designation,
17 this section shall no longer apply and the case shall proceed and the court
18 shall grant a continuance upon request.
19 (e) Appeal. An adjudication under this section is an appealable order
20 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2380, and amendments thereto.
21 (f) This section shall be part of and supplemental to the revised
22 Kansas juvenile justice code.
23 Sec. 25. K.S.A. 38-2396 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
24 2396. (a) When a juvenile is placed outside the juvenile's home at a
25 dispositional hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(k)(j), and amendments
26 thereto, and no reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the
27 hearing, a written reintegration plan shall be prepared and submitted to the
28 court within 15 days of the initial order of the court.
29 (b) The plan shall be prepared by the person who has custody or, if
30 directed by the court, by a community supervision officer.
31 (c) If there is a lack of agreement among persons necessary for the
32 success of the plan, the person or entity having custody of the child shall
33 notify the court, and the court shall set a hearing pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
34 2367, and amendments thereto.
35 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
36 Kansas juvenile justice code.
37 (e) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2017.
38 Sec. 26. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
39 2399. (a) The secretary of corrections may contract for use of not more
40 than 50 non-foster home beds in youth residential facilities for placement
41 of juvenile offenders pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13)(a)(11), and
42 amendments thereto.
43 (b) When contracting for services, the secretary shall:

SB 111 44
1 (1) Contract with facilities that have high success rates and decrease
2 recidivism rates for juvenile offenders;
3 (2) consider contracting for bed space across the entire state to lower
4 the cost of transportation of juvenile offenders; and
5 (3) give priority to existing facilities that are able to meet the
6 requirements of the secretary for providing residential services to juvenile
7 offenders.
8 (c) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2018.
9 Sec. 27. K.S.A. 75-724 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-724.
10 (a) Any person convicted or adjudicated of an offense that, pursuant to
11 K.S.A. 21-2511, and amendments thereto, requires submission of a DNA
12 sample upon arrest, charging or placement in custody, shall pay a separate
13 court cost of $200 as a Kansas bureau of investigation DNA database fee
14 upon conviction or adjudication.
15 (b) The court shall order such fees regardless of whether the person's
16 DNA sample was already on file with the Kansas bureau of investigation
17 at the time such person was arrested, charged or placed in custody, unless
18 the person can prove to the court that the person: (1) Has paid such fees in
19 connection with a prior conviction or adjudication; and (2) did not submit
20 specimens of blood or an oral or other biological sample authorized by the
21 Kansas bureau of investigation to the Kansas bureau of investigation for
22 the current offense of conviction or adjudication.
23 (c) The court shall not lessen or waive such fees unless the court has
24 determined such person is indigent and the basis for the court's
25 determination is reflected in the court's order.
26 (d) Such fees shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any
27 and all fines and penalties otherwise provided for by law for such offense.
28 (e) Disbursements from the Kansas bureau of investigation DNA
29 database fee deposited into the DNA database fee fund of the Kansas

39 designated by the attorney general.
40 (g) All fees shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with
41 the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt
42 of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount
43 in the state treasury to the credit of the DNA database fee fund, which is

SB 111 45
1 hereby established in the state treasury.
2 (h) Fees received into this fund shall be supplemental to regular
3 appropriations to the Kansas bureau of investigation.
4 (i) The fee required by this section shall not be assessed to a juvenile
5 who is being adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense that requires
