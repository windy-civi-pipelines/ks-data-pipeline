9 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
10 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 39-709 is hereby amended to read as
11 follows: 39-709. (a) General eligibility requirements for assistance for
12 which federal moneys are expended. Subject to the additional requirements
13 below, assistance in accordance with plans under which federal moneys
14 are expended may be granted to any needy person who:
15 (1) Has insufficient income or resources to provide a reasonable
16 subsistence compatible with decency and health. Where a husband and
17 wife or cohabiting partners are living together, the combined income or
18 resources of both shall be considered in determining the eligibility of
19 either or both for such assistance unless otherwise prohibited by law. The
20 secretary, in determining need of any applicant for or recipient of
21 assistance shall not take into account the financial responsibility of any
22 individual for any applicant or recipient of assistance unless such applicant
23 or recipient is such individual's spouse, cohabiting partner or such
24 individual's minor child or minor stepchild if the stepchild is living with
25 such individual. The secretary in determining need of an individual may
26 provide such income and resource exemptions as may be permitted by
27 federal law. For purposes of eligibility for temporary assistance for needy
28 families, for food assistance and for any other assistance provided through
29 the Kansas department for children and families under which federal
30 moneys are expended, the secretary for children and families shall
31 consider one motor vehicle owned by the applicant for assistance,
32 regardless of the value of such vehicle, as exempt personal property and
33 shall consider any equity in any boat, personal water craft, recreational
34 vehicle, recreational off-highway vehicle or all-terrain vehicle, as defined
35 by K.S.A. 8-126, and amendments thereto, or any additional motor vehicle

HB 2362 2
1 owned by the applicant for assistance to be a nonexempt resource of the
2 applicant for assistance except that any additional motor vehicle used by
3 the applicant, the applicant's spouse or the applicant's cohabiting partner
4 for the primary purpose of earning income may be considered as exempt
5 personal property in the secretary's discretion; or
6 (2) is a citizen of the United States or is an alien lawfully admitted to
7 the United States and who is residing in the state of Kansas.
8 (b) Temporary assistance for needy families. Assistance may be
9 granted under this act to any dependent child, or relative, subject to the
10 general eligibility requirements as set out in subsection (a), who resides in
11 the state of Kansas or whose parent or other relative with whom the child
12 is living resides in the state of Kansas. Such assistance shall be known as
13 temporary assistance for needy families. Where the husband and wife or
14 cohabiting partners are living together, both shall register for work under
15 the program requirements for temporary assistance for needy families in
16 accordance with criteria and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations
17 of the secretary.

20 services and all individuals living together in which there is a relationship
21 of legal responsibility or a qualifying caretaker relationship. This will
22 include a cohabiting boyfriend or girlfriend living with the person legally
23 responsible for the child. The family group shall not be eligible for TANF
24 if the family group contains at least one adult member who has received
25 TANF, including the federal TANF assistance received in any other state,
26 for 24 calendar months beginning on and after October 1, 1996, unless the
27 secretary determines a hardship exists and grants an extension allowing
28 receipt of TANF until the 36-month limit is reached. No extension beyond

6 applicant may have in such person's own behalf or in behalf of any other
7 family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid. In
8 any case in which an order for child support has been established and the
9 legal custodian and obligee under the order surrenders physical custody of
10 the child to a caretaker relative without obtaining a modification of legal
11 custody and support rights on behalf of the child are assigned pursuant to
12 this section, the surrender of physical custody and the assignment shall
13 transfer, by operation of law, the child's support rights under the order to
14 the secretary on behalf of the state. Such assignment shall be of all

21 caretaker relative who is an applicant or recipient of such assistance on the
22 child's behalf, the applicant, recipient or obligee is also deemed to have

24 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
25 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
26 payments received by the secretary in behalf of any person applying for,
27 receiving or having received such assistance. This limited power of
28 attorney shall be effective from the date the secretary approves the
29 application for aid and shall remain in effect until the assignment of
30 support rights has been terminated in full.
31 (e) Requirements for medical assistance for which federal moneys or
32 state moneys or both are expended. (1) When the secretary has adopted a
33 medical care plan under which federal moneys or state moneys or both are
34 expended, medical assistance in accordance with such plan shall be
35 granted to any person who is a citizen of the United States or who is an
36 alien lawfully admitted to the United States and who is residing in the state
37 of Kansas, whose resources and income do not exceed the levels
38 prescribed by the secretary. In determining the need of an individual, the
39 secretary may provide for income and resource exemptions and protected
40 income and resource levels. Resources from inheritance shall be counted.
41 A disclaimer of an inheritance pursuant to K.S.A. 59-2291, and
42 amendments thereto, shall constitute a transfer of resources. The secretary
43 shall exempt principal and interest held in irrevocable trust pursuant to

HB 2362 12
1 K.S.A. 16-303(c), and amendments thereto, from the eligibility
2 requirements of applicants for and recipients of medical assistance. Such
3 assistance shall be known as medical assistance.
4 (2) For the purposes of medical assistance eligibility determinations
5 on or after July 1, 2004, if an applicant or recipient owns property in joint
6 tenancy with some other party and the applicant or recipient of medical
7 assistance has restricted or conditioned their interest in such property to a
8 specific and discrete property interest less than 100%, then such
9 designation will cause the full value of the property to be considered an
10 available resource to the applicant or recipient. Medical assistance
11 eligibility for receipt of benefits under the title XIX of the social security
12 act, commonly known as medicaid, shall not be expanded, as provided for
13 in the patient protection and affordable care act, public law 111-148, 124
14 stat. 119, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010,
15 public law 111-152, 124 stat. 1029, unless the legislature expressly
16 consents to, and approves of, the expansion of medicaid services by an act
17 of the legislature.
18 (3) (A) Resources from trusts shall be considered when determining
19 eligibility of a trust beneficiary for medical assistance. Medical assistance
20 is to be secondary to all resources, including trusts, that may be available
21 to an applicant or recipient of medical assistance.
22 (B) If a trust has discretionary language, the trust shall be considered
23 to be an available resource to the extent, using the full extent of discretion,
24 the trustee may make any of the income or principal available to the
25 applicant or recipient of medical assistance. Any such discretionary trust
26 shall be considered an available resource unless:
27 (i) At the time of creation or amendment of the trust, the trust states a
28 clear intent that the trust is supplemental to public assistance; and
29 (ii) the trust is funded:
30 (a) From resources of a person who, at the time of such funding,
31 owed no duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical assistance;
32 or
33 (b) not more than nominally from resources of a person while that
34 person owed a duty of support to the applicant or recipient of medical
35 assistance.
36 (C) For the purposes of this paragraph, "public assistance" includes,
37 but is not limited to, medicaid, medical assistance or title XIX of the social
38 security act.
39 (4) (A) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party
40 to a contract, agreement or accord for personal services being provided by
41 a nonlicensed individual or provider and such contract, agreement or
42 accord involves health and welfare monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case
43 management, communication with medical, health or other professionals,

HB 2362 13
1 or other activities related to home health care, long term care, medical
2 assistance benefits, or other related issues, any moneys paid under such
3 contract, agreement or accord shall be considered to be an available
4 resource unless the following restrictions are met:
5 (i) The contract, agreement or accord must be in writing and executed
6 prior to any services being provided;
7 (ii) the moneys paid are in direct relationship with the fair market
8 value of such services being provided by similarly situated and trained
9 nonlicensed individuals;
10 (iii) if no similarly situated nonlicensed individuals or situations can
11 be found, the value of services will be based on federal hourly minimum
12 wage standards;
13 (iv) such individual providing the services shall report all receipts of
14 moneys as income to the appropriate state and federal governmental
15 revenue agencies;
16 (v) any amounts due under such contract, agreement or accord shall
17 be paid after the services are rendered;
18 (vi) the applicant or recipient shall have the power to revoke the
19 contract, agreement or accord; and
20 (vii) upon the death of the applicant or recipient, the contract,
21 agreement or accord ceases.
22 (B) When an applicant or recipient of medical assistance is a party to
23 a written contract for personal services being provided by a licensed health
24 professional or facility and such contract involves health and welfare
25 monitoring, pharmacy assistance, case management, communication with
26 medical, health or other professionals, or other activities related to home
27 health care, long term care, medical assistance benefits or other related
28 issues, any moneys paid in advance of receipt of services for such
29 contracts shall be considered to be an available resource.
30 (5) Any trust may be amended if such amendment is permitted by the
31 Kansas uniform trust code.
32 (f) Eligibility for medical assistance of resident receiving medical
33 care outside state. A person who is receiving medical care including long-
34 term care outside of Kansas whose health would be endangered by the
35 postponement of medical care until return to the state or by travel to return
36 to Kansas, may be determined eligible for medical assistance if such
37 individual is a resident of Kansas and all other eligibility factors are met.
38 Persons who are receiving medical care on an ongoing basis in a long-term
39 medical care facility in a state other than Kansas and who do not return to
40 a care facility in Kansas when they are able to do so, shall no longer be
41 eligible to receive assistance in Kansas unless such medical care is not
42 available in a comparable facility or program providing such medical care
43 in Kansas. For persons who are minors or who are under guardianship, the

HB 2362 14
1 actions of the parent or guardian shall be deemed to be the actions of the
2 child or ward in determining whether or not the person is remaining
3 outside the state voluntarily.
4 (g) Medical assistance; reporting of lottery or gambling prize
5 winnings. Every month the department of administration shall provide to
6 the department of health and environment the social security numbers or
7 alternate taxpayer identification numbers of all persons who claim a
8 Kansas lottery or gambling prize in excess of $5,000 during the reported
9 month. The department of health and environment shall verify if
10 individuals with such winnings are receiving medical assistance in
11 Kansas. The department of health and environment shall use data received
12 under this subsection for no other purpose than to determine if any
13 recipient's eligibility for benefits has been affected by lottery prize
14 winnings. The department of health and environment shall not publicly
15 disclose the identity of any lottery prize winner, including recipients who
16 are determined to have illegally received benefits.
17 (g)(h) Medical assistance; assignment of rights to medical support
18 and limited power of attorney; recovery from estates of deceased
19 recipients. (1) (A) Except as otherwise provided in K.S.A. 39-786 and 39-
20 787, and amendments thereto, or as otherwise authorized on and after
21 September 30, 1989, under section 303 of the federal medicare
22 catastrophic coverage act of 1988, whichever is applicable, by applying for
23 or receiving medical assistance under a medical care plan in which federal
24 funds are expended, any accrued, present or future rights to support and
25 any rights to payment for medical care from a third party of an applicant or
26 recipient and any other family member for whom the applicant is applying
27 shall be deemed to have been assigned to the secretary on behalf of the
28 state. The assignment shall automatically become effective upon the date
29 of approval for such assistance without the requirement that any document
30 be signed by the applicant or recipient. By applying for or receiving
31 medical assistance the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have
32 appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney-in-fact
33 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
34 money orders or other negotiable instruments, representing payments
35 received by the secretary in on behalf of any person applying for, receiving
36 or having received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be
37 effective from the date the secretary approves the application for assistance
38 and shall remain in effect until the assignment has been terminated in full.
39 The assignment of any rights to payment for medical care from a third
40 party under this subsection shall not prohibit a health care provider from
41 directly billing an insurance carrier for services rendered if the provider
42 has not submitted a claim covering such services to the secretary for
43 payment. Support amounts collected on behalf of persons whose rights to

HB 2362 15
1 support are assigned to the secretary only under this subsection and no
2 other shall be distributed pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756(d), and amendments
3 thereto, except that any amounts designated as medical support shall be
4 retained by the secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of
5 assistance. Amounts collected pursuant to the assignment of rights to
6 payment for medical care from a third party shall also be retained by the
7 secretary for repayment of the unreimbursed portion of assistance.
8 (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), the
9 secretary of health and environment, or the secretary's designee, is hereby
10 authorized to and shall exercise any of the powers specified in
11 subparagraph (A) in relation to performance of such secretary's duties
12 pertaining to medical subrogation, estate recovery or any other duties
13 assigned to such secretary in article 74 of chapter 75 of the Kansas Statutes
14 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
15 (2) The amount of any medical assistance paid after June 30, 1992,
16 under the provisions of subsection (e) is a claim against the property or
17 any interest therein belonging to and a part of the estate of any deceased
18 recipient or, if there is no estate, the estate of the surviving spouse, if any,
19 shall be charged for such medical assistance paid to either or both and a
20 claim against any funds of such recipient or spouse in any account under
21 K.S.A. 9-1215, 17-2263 or 17-2264, and amendments thereto. There shall
22 be no recovery of medical assistance correctly paid to or on behalf of an
23 individual under subsection (e) except after the death of the surviving
24 spouse of the individual, if any, and only at a time when the individual has
25 no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently
26 and totally disabled. Transfers of real or personal property by recipients of
27 medical assistance without adequate consideration are voidable and may
28 be set aside. Except where there is a surviving spouse, or a surviving child
29 who is under 21 years of age or is blind or permanently and totally
30 disabled, the amount of any medical assistance paid under subsection (e) is
31 a claim against the estate in any guardianship or conservatorship
32 proceeding. The monetary value of any benefits received by the recipient
33 of such medical assistance under long-term care insurance, as defined by
34 K.S.A. 40-2227, and amendments thereto, shall be a credit against the
35 amount of the claim provided for such medical assistance under this
36 subsection. The secretary of health and environment is authorized to
37 enforce each claim provided for under this subsection. The secretary of
38 health and environment shall not be required to pursue every claim, but is
39 granted discretion to determine which claims to pursue. All moneys
40 received by the secretary of health and environment from claims under this
41 subsection shall be deposited in the social welfare fund. The secretary of
42 health and environment may adopt rules and regulations for the
43 implementation and administration of the medical assistance recovery

HB 2362 16
1 program under this subsection.
2 (3) By applying for or receiving medical assistance under the
3 provisions of article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
4 amendments thereto, such individual or such individual's agent, fiduciary,
5 guardian, conservator, representative payee or other person acting on
6 behalf of the individual consents to the following definitions of estate and
7 the results therefrom:
8 (A) If an individual receives any medical assistance before July 1,
9 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
10 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
11 paragraph (2), such claim is limited to the individual's probatable estate as
12 defined by applicable law; and
13 (B) if an individual receives any medical assistance on or after July 1,
14 2004, pursuant to article 7 of chapter 39 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
15 and amendments thereto, which forms the basis for a claim under
16 paragraph (2), such claim shall apply to the individual's medical assistance
17 estate. The medical assistance estate is defined as including all real and
18 personal property and other assets in which the deceased individual had
19 any legal title or interest immediately before or at the time of death to the
20 extent of that interest or title. The medical assistance estate includes
21 without limitation, assets conveyed to a survivor, heir or assign of the
22 deceased recipient through joint tenancy, tenancy in common,
23 survivorship, transfer-on-death deed, payable-on-death contract, life estate,
24 trust, annuities or similar arrangement.
25 (4) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
26 designee is authorized to file and enforce a lien against the real property of
27 a recipient of medical assistance in certain situations, subject to all prior
28 liens of record and transfers for value to a bona fide purchaser of record.
29 The lien must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county
30 where the real property is located within one year from the date of death of
31 the recipient and must contain the legal description of all real property in
32 the county subject to the lien.
33 (A) After the death of a recipient of medical assistance, the secretary
34 of health and environment or the secretary's designee may place a lien on
35 any interest in real property owned by such recipient.
36 (B) The secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
37 designee may place a lien on any interest in real property owned by a
38 recipient of medical assistance during the lifetime of such recipient. Such
39 lien may be filed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing has
40 been given. Such lien may be enforced only upon competent medical
41 testimony that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be
42 discharged and returned home. A six-month period of compensated
43 inpatient care at a nursing home or other medical institution shall

HB 2362 17
1 constitute a determination by the department of health and environment
2 that the recipient cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and
3 returned home. To return home means the recipient leaves the nursing or
4 medical facility and resides in the home on which the lien has been placed
5 for a continuous period of at least 90 days without being readmitted as an
6 inpatient to a nursing or medical facility. The amount of the lien shall be
7 for the amount of assistance paid by the department of health and
8 environment until the time of the filing of the lien and for any amount paid
9 thereafter for such medical assistance to the recipient. After the lien is filed
10 against any real property owned by the recipient, such lien will be
11 dissolved if the recipient is discharged, returns home and resides upon the
12 real property to which the lien is attached for a continuous period of at
13 least 90 days without being readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
14 medical facility. If the recipient is readmitted as an inpatient to a nursing or
15 medical facility for a continuous period of less than 90 days, another
16 continuous period of at least 90 days shall be completed prior to
17 dissolution of the lien.
18 (5) The lien filed by the secretary of health and environment or the
19 secretary's designee for medical assistance correctly received may be
20 enforced before or after the death of the recipient by the filing of an action
21 to foreclose such lien in the Kansas district court or through an estate
22 probate court action in the county where the real property of the recipient
23 is located. However, it may be enforced only:
24 (A) After the death of the surviving spouse of the recipient;
25 (B) when there is no child of the recipient, natural or adopted, who is
26 20 years of age or less residing in the home;
27 (C) when there is no adult child of the recipient, natural or adopted,
28 who is blind or disabled residing in the home; or
29 (D) when no brother or sister of the recipient is lawfully residing in
30 the home, who has resided there for at least one year immediately before
31 the date of the recipient's admission to the nursing or medical facility, and
32 has resided there on a continuous basis since that time.
33 (6) The lien remains on the property even after a transfer of the title
34 by conveyance, sale, succession, inheritance or will unless one of the
35 following events occur:
36 (A) The lien is satisfied. The recipient, the heirs, personal
37 representative or assigns of the recipient may discharge such lien at any
38 time by paying the amount of the lien to the secretary of health and
39 environment or the secretary's designee;
40 (B) the lien is terminated by foreclosure of prior lien of record or
41 settlement action taken in lieu of foreclosure; or
42 (C) the value of the real property is consumed by the lien, at which
43 time the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designee

HB 2362 18
1 may force the sale for the real property to satisfy the lien.
2 (7) If the secretary for aging and disability services or the secretary of
3 health and environment, or both, or such secretary's designee has not filed
4 an action to foreclose the lien in the Kansas district court in the county
5 where the real property is located within 10 years from the date of the
6 filing of the lien, then the lien shall become dormant, and shall cease to
7 operate as a lien on the real estate of the recipient. Such dormant lien may
8 be revived in the same manner as a dormant judgment lien is revived under
9 K.S.A. 60-2403 et seq., and amendments thereto.
10 (8) Within seven days of receipt of notice by the secretary for
11 children and families or the secretary's designee of the death of a recipient
12 of medical assistance under this subsection, the secretary for children and
13 families or the secretary's designee shall give notice of such recipient's
14 death to the secretary of health and environment or the secretary's
15 designee.
16 (9) All rules and regulations adopted on and after July 1, 2013, and
17 prior to July 1, 2014, to implement this subsection shall continue to be
18 effective and shall be deemed to be duly adopted rules and regulations of
19 the secretary of health and environment until revised, amended, revoked or
20 nullified pursuant to law.
21 (h)(i) Placement under the revised Kansas code for care of children
22 or revised Kansas juvenile justice code; assignment of support rights and
23 limited power of attorney. In any case in which the secretary for children
24 and families pays for the expenses of care and custody of a child pursuant
25 to K.S.A. 38-2201 et seq. or 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto,
26 including the expenses of any foster care placement, an assignment of all
27 past, present and future support rights of the child in custody possessed by
28 either parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
29 child is, by operation of law, conveyed to the secretary. Such assignment
30 shall become effective upon placement of a child in the custody of the
31 secretary or upon payment of the expenses of care and custody of a child
32 by the secretary without the requirement that any document be signed by
33 the parent or other person entitled to receive support payments for the
34 child. When the secretary pays for the expenses of care and custody of a
35 child or a child is placed in the custody of the secretary, the parent or other
36 person entitled to receive support payments for the child is also deemed to
37 have appointed the secretary, or the secretary's designee, as attorney in fact
38 to perform the specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks,
39 money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support
40 payments received by the secretary on behalf of the child. This limited
41 power of attorney shall be effective from the date the assignment to
42 support rights becomes effective and shall remain in effect until the
43 assignment of support rights has been terminated in full.

HB 2362 19
1 (i)(j) No person who voluntarily quits employment or who is fired
2 from employment due to gross misconduct as defined by rules and
3 regulations of the secretary or who is a fugitive from justice by reason of a
4 felony conviction or charge or violation of a condition of probation or
5 parole imposed under federal or state law shall be eligible to receive public
6 assistance benefits in this state. Any recipient of public assistance who
7 fails to timely comply with monthly reporting requirements under criteria
8 and guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
9 subject to a penalty established by the secretary by rules and regulations.
10 (j)(k) If the applicant or recipient of temporary assistance for needy
11 families is a mother of the dependent child, as a condition of the mother's
12 eligibility for temporary assistance for needy families the mother shall
13 identify by name and, if known, by current address the father of the
14 dependent child except that the secretary may adopt by rules and
15 regulations exceptions to this requirement in cases of undue hardship. Any
16 recipient of temporary assistance for needy families who fails to cooperate
17 with requirements relating to child support services under criteria and
18 guidelines prescribed by rules and regulations of the secretary shall be
19 subject to a penalty established by the secretary.
20 (k)(l) By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food
21 assistance, the applicant or recipient shall be deemed to have assigned,
22 pursuant to K.S.A. 39-756, and amendments thereto, to the secretary on
23 behalf of the state only accrued, present or future rights to support from
24 any other person such applicant may have in such person's own behalf or
25 in behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying
26 for or receiving aid. The assignment of support rights shall automatically
27 become effective upon the date of approval for or receipt of such aid
28 without the requirement that any document be signed by the applicant or
29 recipient. By applying for or receiving child care subsidy or food
30 assistance, the applicant or recipient is also deemed to have appointed the
31 secretary, or the secretary's designee, as an attorney in fact to perform the
32 specific act of negotiating and endorsing all drafts, checks, money orders
33 or other negotiable instruments representing support payments received by
34 the secretary in behalf of any person applying for, receiving or having
35 received such assistance. This limited power of attorney shall be effective
36 from the date the secretary approves the application for aid and shall
37 remain in effect until the assignment of support rights has been terminated
38 in full. An applicant or recipient who has assigned support rights to the
39 secretary pursuant to this subsection shall cooperate in establishing and
40 enforcing support obligations to the same extent required of applicants for
41 or recipients of temporary assistance for needy families.
42 (l)(m) (1) A program of drug screening for applicants for cash
43 assistance as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance and persons

HB 2362 20
1 receiving cash assistance as a condition of continued receipt of cash
2 assistance shall be established, subject to applicable federal law, by the
3 secretary for children and families on and before January 1, 2014. Under
4 such program of drug screening, the secretary for children and families
5 shall order a drug screening of an applicant for or a recipient of cash
6 assistance at any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such applicant
7 for or recipient of cash assistance is unlawfully using a controlled
8 substance or controlled substance analog. The secretary for children and
9 families may use any information obtained by the secretary for children
10 and families to determine whether such reasonable suspicion exists,
11 including, but not limited to, an applicant's or recipient's demeanor, missed
12 appointments and arrest or other police records, previous employment or
13 application for employment in an occupation or industry that regularly
14 conducts drug screening, termination from previous employment due to
15 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog or
16 prior drug screening records of the applicant or recipient indicating
17 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
18 (2) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance whose drug
19 screening results in a positive test may request that the drug screening
20 specimen be sent to a different drug testing facility for an additional drug
21 screening. Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who requests
22 an additional drug screening at a different drug testing facility shall be
23 required to pay the cost of drug screening. Such applicant or recipient who
24 took the additional drug screening and who tested negative for unlawful
25 use of a controlled substance and controlled substance analog shall be
26 reimbursed for the cost of such additional drug screening.
27 (3) Any applicant for or recipient of cash assistance who tests
28 positive for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance
29 analog shall be required to complete a substance abuse treatment program
30 approved by the secretary for children and families, secretary of labor or
31 secretary of commerce, and a job skills program approved by the secretary
32 for children and families, secretary of labor or secretary of commerce.
33 Subject to applicable federal laws, any applicant for or recipient of cash
34 assistance who fails to complete or refuses to participate in the substance
35 abuse treatment program or job skills program as required under this
36 subsection shall be ineligible to receive cash assistance until completion of
37 such substance abuse treatment and job skills programs. Upon completion
38 of both substance abuse treatment and job skills programs, such applicant
39 for or recipient of cash assistance may be subject to periodic drug
40 screening, as determined by the secretary for children and families. Upon a
41 second positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or
42 controlled substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be ordered
43 to complete again a substance abuse treatment program and job skills

HB 2362 21
1 program, and shall be terminated from cash assistance for a period of 12
2 months, or until such recipient of cash assistance completes both substance
3 abuse treatment and job skills programs, whichever is later. Upon a third
4 positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled
5 substance analog, a recipient of cash assistance shall be terminated from
6 cash assistance, subject to applicable federal law.
7 (4) If an applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is ineligible for
8 or terminated from cash assistance as a result of a positive test for
9 unlawful use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog, and
10 such applicant for or recipient of cash assistance is the parent or legal
11 guardian of a minor child, an appropriate protective payee shall be
12 designated to receive cash assistance on behalf of such child. Such parent
13 or legal guardian of the minor child may choose to designate an individual
14 to receive cash assistance for such parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
15 as approved by the secretary for children and families. Prior to the
16 designated individual receiving any cash assistance, the secretary for
17 children and families shall review whether reasonable suspicion exists that
18 such designated individual is unlawfully using a controlled substance or
19 controlled substance analog.
20 (A) In addition, any individual designated to receive cash assistance
21 on behalf of an eligible minor child shall be subject to drug screening at
22 any time when reasonable suspicion exists that such designated individual
23 is unlawfully using a controlled substance or controlled substance analog.
24 The secretary for children and families may use any information obtained
25 by the secretary for children and families to determine whether such
26 reasonable suspicion exists, including, but not limited to, the designated
27 individual's demeanor, missed appointments and arrest or other police
28 records, previous employment or application for employment in an
29 occupation or industry that regularly conducts drug screening, termination
30 from previous employment due to unlawful use of a controlled substance
31 or controlled substance analog or prior drug screening records of the
32 designated individual indicating unlawful use of a controlled substance or
33 controlled substance analog.
34 (B) Any designated individual whose drug screening results in a
35 positive test may request that the drug screening specimen be sent to a
36 different drug testing facility for an additional drug screening. Any
37 designated individual who requests an additional drug screening at a
38 different drug testing facility shall be required to pay the cost of drug
39 screening. Such designated individual who took the additional drug
40 screening and who tested negative for unlawful use of a controlled
41 substance and controlled substance analog shall be reimbursed for the cost
42 of such additional drug screening.
43 (C) Upon any positive test for unlawful use of a controlled substance

HB 2362 22
1 or controlled substance analog, the designated individual shall not receive
2 cash assistance on behalf of the parent's or legal guardian's minor child,
3 and another designated individual shall be selected by the secretary for
4 children and families to receive cash assistance on behalf of such parent's
5 or legal guardian's minor child.
6 (5) If a person has been convicted under federal or state law of any
7 offense that is classified as a felony by the law of the jurisdiction and has
8 as an element of such offense the manufacture, cultivation, distribution,
9 possession or use of a controlled substance or controlled substance analog,
10 and the date of conviction is on or after July 1, 2013, such person shall
11 thereby become forever ineligible to receive any cash assistance under this
12 subsection unless such conviction is the person's first conviction. First-
13 time offenders convicted under federal or state law of any offense that is
