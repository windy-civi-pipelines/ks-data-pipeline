37 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
38 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
39 with the modifications specified in this section.
40 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
41 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
42 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
43 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
SB 25 4
1 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
2 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
3 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
4 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
5 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
6 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
7 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after
8 December 31, 1987, shall be excluded from computation of Kansas

10 income.
11 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
12 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
13 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not

15 imposed under the provisions of K.S.A. 79-1107 or 79-1108, and

22 deduction of the taxes being refunded resulted in a tax benefit for Kansas
23 income tax purposes during a prior taxable year. Such refunds shall be
24 included in income in the year actually received regardless of the method
25 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
26 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
27 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
28 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
29 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
30 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
31 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total

9 as determined under K.S.A. 79-32,117(b)(iv), and amendments thereto,
10 and minus the deduction for federal income taxes as provided by
11 subsection (c)(ii) shall be such corporation's Kansas taxable income.

42 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
43 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of

SB 25 4
1 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
2 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
3 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
4 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
5 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
