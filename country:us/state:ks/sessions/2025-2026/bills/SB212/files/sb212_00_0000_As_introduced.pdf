43 acquisition cost that is not at least 15% lower than the referenced brand

SB 212 6
1 biologic; or
2 (3) the prescription drug product is a generic drug that, as adjusted
3 annually for inflation in accordance with the consumer price index, has a
4 wholesale acquisition cost that:
5 (A) Is $100 or more for any of the following:
6 (i) A 30-day supply that lasts a patient for a period of 30 consecutive
7 days based on the recommended dosage approved for labeling by the
8 United States food and drug administration;
9 (ii) a supply that lasts a patient for less than 30 days based on the
10 recommended dosage approved for labeling by the United States food and
11 drug administration; and

13 food and drug administration does not recommend a finite dosage; and
14 (B) increased by 200% or more during the immediately preceding 12-
15 month period, as determined by the difference between the resulting
16 wholesale acquisition cost and the average wholesale acquisition cost
17 reported over the immediately preceding 12 months; or
18 (4) the prescription drug product is a prescription drug product that
19 may create affordability challenges for healthcare systems in this state and
20 patients, including, but not limited to, a prescription drug product needed
21 to address a public health emergency.
22 (b) In selecting one or more prescription drug products under
23 subsection (a), the board shall not be required to identify each prescription
24 drug product that meets the criteria described in subsection (a).
25 (1) The board shall determine whether to conduct a cost and
26 affordability review for each prescription drug product that is selected
27 under subsection (a). In making a determination under this subsection, the
28 board shall consider input from the council and the average patient cost
29 share for each prescription drug product.
30 (2) If the board conducts a cost and affordability review of a
31 prescription drug product, the board may consider when conducting the
32 review any document or research related to the manufacturer's selection of
33 the introductory price or price increase of the prescription drug product,
34 including life cycle management, net average price in this state, market
35 competition, projected revenue and, subject to subsection (e), the
36 estimated cost-effectiveness of the prescription drug product. In its review,
37 the board shall determine whether the use of a prescription drug product
38 that is fully consistent with the labeling approved by the United States
39 food and drug administration or standard medical practice for the
40 prescription drug product has led or will lead to affordability challenges to
41 healthcare systems in this state or high out-of-pocket costs for patients in
42 this state. In making its determination under this subsection, the board
43 shall consider any information that a manufacturer chooses to provide to

SB 212 7
1 the board and all of the following factors, to the extent practicable:
2 (A) The wholesale acquisition cost for the prescription drug product
3 sold in this state;
4 (B) the average monetary price concession, discount or rebate that the
5 manufacturer provides or is expected to provide to health insurers and
6 pharmacy benefit managers in this state, expressed as a percent of the
7 wholesale acquisition cost for the prescription drug product under review;
8 (C) the price at which therapeutic alternatives for the prescription
9 drug product have been sold in this state;
10 (D) the average monetary concession, discount or rebate that another
11 manufacturer provides or is expected to provide to health insurers and
12 pharmacy benefit managers in this state for therapeutic alternatives;
13 (E) the cost to health insurers based on patient access consistent with
14 United States food and drug administration labeled indications or
15 recognized standard medical practice;
16 (F) the impact on patient access resulting from the cost of the
17 prescription drug product relative to insurance benefit design;
18 (G) the current or expected dollar value of drug-specific patient
19 access programs that are supported by the manufacturer;
20 (H) the relative financial impact to health, medical or social service
21 costs as can be quantified and compared to baseline effects of existing
22 therapeutic alternatives;
23 (I) the average patient copay or other cost-sharing measures for the
24 prescription drug product in this state; and
25 (J) any other factor established by the board.
26 (c) If the board determines that spending on a prescription drug
27 product reviewed under this section has led or will lead to affordability
28 challenges to healthcare systems in this state or high out-of-pocket costs
29 for patients in this state, the board may, subject to subsection (d), adopt
30 rules and regulations establishing an upper payment limit for the
31 prescription drug product. In establishing an upper payment limit under
32 this subsection, the board shall consider all of the following:
33 (1) Relevant administrative costs related to supplying or stocking the
34 prescription drug product; and
35 (2) the impact of an upper payment limit for the prescription drug
36 product on 340-B program entities.
37 (d) An upper payment limit established under this section shall not
38 include professional dispensing fees.
39 (e) If the board considers the estimated cost-effectiveness of a
40 prescription drug product under this section, the board:
41 (1) Shall not use a cost-per-quality adjusted life year, or a similar
42 measure, to identify a subpopulation for which a prescription drug product
43 would be less cost-effective due to severity of illness, age or preexisting

SB 212 8
1 disability; and
2 (2) if the board uses a cost-effectiveness analysis for a prescription drug
3 product that extends an individual's life, the board shall use a cost-
4 effectiveness analysis that weighs the value of all additional lifetime
5 gained equally for any individual, regardless of the severity of illness, age
6 or preexisting disability.
7 (f) An upper payment limit established under this section shall take
8 effect on the date adopted by the board by rule and regulation, except that
9 such date shall not be sooner than six months after the date that the upper
10 payment limit is established.
11 Sec. 6. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if the
12 board establishes an upper payment limit under section 5, and amendments
13 thereto, for a prescription drug product intended for use by individuals in
14 this state, beginning on the effective date of the upper payment limit, a
15 prescription drug product purchaser or third-party payer shall not
16 purchase, bill or reimburse for the prescription drug product in an amount
17 that exceeds the upper payment limit, regardless of whether the
18 prescription drug product is dispensed or distributed in person, by mail or
19 by other means.
20 (b) A prescription drug product purchaser or third-party payer shall
21 not reimburse a pharmacy for a prescription drug product in an amount
22 that is less than an upper payment limit established under section 5, and
23 amendments thereto, for the prescription drug product.
24 (c) The attorney general may investigate a violation of this section
25 and may commence a civil action against a person for appropriate relief,
26 including, but not limited to, injunctive relief for a violation of this section.
27 (d) This section shall not prohibit any other sanction against a
28 prescription drug product purchaser or third-party payor as provided by
29 law.
30 (e) A person aggrieved by a decision of the board under this act may
31 request an appeal within 30 days. A hearing and appeal is subject to the
32 Kansas administrative procedure act.
33 (f) The board may adopt rules and regulations to implement and
34 administer this act, and the board may enter into contracts with third
35 parties to assist the board in carrying out its duties under this act.
36 Sec. 7. There is hereby established in the state treasury the
37 prescription drug affordability fund, which shall be administered by the
38 commissioner. All expenditures from the prescription drug affordability
39 fund shall be to fund the board and for costs expended by the department
40 to implement and administer the prescription drug cost and affordability
41 review act. All expenditures from the prescription drug affordability fund
42 shall be made in accordance with appropriation acts upon warrants of the
43 director of accounts and reports issued pursuant to vouchers approved by

2 received by the board for the prescription drug cost and affordability
3 review act shall be deposited in the state treasury in accordance with the
4 provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of
