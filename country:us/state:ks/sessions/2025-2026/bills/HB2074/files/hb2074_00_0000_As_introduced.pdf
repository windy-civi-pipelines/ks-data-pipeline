37 several properties while occupied by the household as its homestead
38 during the year. Whenever a homestead is an integral part of a larger unit
39 such as a multi-purpose or multi-dwelling building, property taxes accrued
40 shall be that percentage of the total property taxes accrued as the value of
41 the homestead is of the total value. For the purpose of this act, the word
42 "unit" refers to that parcel of property covered by a single tax statement of
43 which the homestead is a part.

HB 2074 4
1 (g) "Disability" means:
2 (1) Inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of
3 any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be
4 expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a
5 continuous period of not less than 12 months, and an individual shall be
6 determined to be under a disability only if the physical or mental
7 impairment or impairments are of such severity that the individual is not
8 only unable to do the individual's previous work but cannot, considering
9 age, education and work experience, engage in any other kind of
10 substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless
11 of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which the individual
12 lives or whether a specific job vacancy exists for the individual, or whether
13 the individual would be hired if application was made for work. For
14 purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), "work
15 which exists in the national economy" means work which exists in
16 significant numbers either in the region where the individual lives or in
17 several regions of the country; for purposes of this subsection, a "physical
18 or mental impairment" is an impairment that results from anatomical,
19 physiological or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by
20 medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques; or
21 (2) blindness and inability by reason of blindness to engage in
22 substantial gainful activity requiring skills or abilities comparable to those
23 of any gainful activity in which the individual has previously engaged with
24 some regularity and over a substantial period of time.

200
26 better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied
27 by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the
28 visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be
29 considered for the purpose of this paragraph as having a central visual
30 acuity of 20/ or less.

31 (i) "Disabled veteran" means a person who is a resident of Kansas
32 and who:
33 (1) Served in the active military, naval, air or space service and who

35 general discharge under honorable conditions;
36 (2) received a disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of
37 duty in the active military, naval, air or space service; and
38 (3) has a service-connected evaluation percentage equal to or greater
39 than 50%, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. or 10 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq.
40 (j) "Rent constituting property taxes accrued" means 15% of the
41 gross rent actually paid in cash or its equivalent in 2025, or any taxable
42 year thereafter, by a claimant and claimant's household solely for the right
43 of occupancy of a Kansas homestead on which ad valorem property taxes

HB 2074 5
1 were levied in full for that year. When a household occupies two or more
2 different homesteads in the same calendar year, "rent constituting property
3 taxes accrued" shall be computed by adding the "rent constituting
4 property taxes accrued" for each property rented by the household while
5 occupied by the household as its homestead during the year.
6 (k) "Gross rent" means the rent paid at arm's length solely for the
7 right of occupancy of a homestead or space rent paid to a landlord for the
8 parking of a mobile home, exclusive of charges for any utilities, services,
9 furniture and furnishings or personal property appliances furnished by the
10 landlord as a part of the rental agreement, whether or not expressly set out
11 in the rental agreement. Whenever the director of taxation finds that the
12 landlord and tenant have not dealt with each other at arm's length and
13 that the "gross rent" charge was excessive, the director may adjust the
14 "gross rent" to a reasonable amount for the purposes of the claim.

16 follows: 79-4508. (a) Commencing in the tax year beginning after
17 December 31, 2005, the amount of any claim pursuant to this act and
