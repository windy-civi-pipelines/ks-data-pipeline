and amendments thereto, by the public moneys pooled method. A bank,
savings and loan association or savings bank designated as a public
depositary shall secure the deposits of one or more governmental units
by depositing, pledging or granting a security interest in a pool of
securities to secure the repayment of all public moneys deposited in
such bank, savings and loan association or savings bank by such

guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation and pursuant to
K.S.A. 9-1402 and 12-1675, and amendments thereto. To fulfill the

public moneys or public funds less the portion of such public moneys
or funds insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance
corporation and pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1402 and 12-1675, and
amendments thereto. Such bank, savings and loan association or
savings bank shall notify the administrator if additional collateral is
required to be pledged due to an increase in deposits placed by the
governmental unit. Such bank, savings and loan association or savings
bank shall notify the administrator if such bank, savings and loan
association or savings bank desires to release collateral due to a
reduction in governmental unit deposits.
(f) Each bank, savings and loan association or savings bank that
satisfies its requirement to secure the deposit of public moneys or
public funds in excess of the amount insured or guaranteed by the
federal deposit insurance corporation by depositing, pledging or
granting a security interest in a single pool of securities, or any
combination thereof, shall, on or before the 10th day of each month,
render to the administrator a statement showing as of the last business
day of the previous month the:
(1) Amount of public moneys or public funds deposited in such
bank, savings and loan association or savings bank that is not insured

(A) Each governmental unit separately; and
(B) all governmental units in the aggregate;
(2) aggregate market value of the pool of securities; and
(3) name, phone number and email address of a representative of
each governmental unit represented in the pool.
(g) Not later than 20 days after the deadline for receiving the
statement required under subsection (f), the administrator shall provide

(1) The amount of public moneys or public funds deposited in
such bank, savings and loan association or savings bank by each
governmental unit as of the last business day of the previous month that
is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance
corporation and that is secured pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1402 and 12-1675,

securities does not meet the statutory requirement, the administrator

bank allowing such bank, savings and loan association or savings bank

Sub for HOUSE BILL No. 2152—page 3
subject to a fine and potential sanctions issued by the administrator
pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the treasurer.
(i) The public moneys pooled method shall not be utilized by any
bank, savings and loan association or savings bank unless the treasurer
establishes a public moneys pooled method in accordance with this
section or designates an administrator pursuant to subsection (c).
(j) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2026.
New Sec. 2. (a) When the administrator determines that a bank,
savings and loan association or savings bank has experienced a default,
the administrator shall:
(1) Ascertain the aggregate amounts of public moneys secured
pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1402 and 12-1675, and amendments thereto, and
deposited in the defaulting bank, savings and loan association or
savings bank, as disclosed by the records of such bank, savings and
loan association or savings bank. The administrator shall determine for
each governmental unit for which public moneys are deposited in the
defaulting bank, savings and loan association or savings bank the
accounts and amount of federal deposit insurance or guarantee that is
available for each account. The administrator shall then determine for
each such governmental unit the amount of public moneys not insured
or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the
amount of public moneys secured by a pool of securities pledged. Upon
completion of such determination, the administrator shall provide each
such governmental unit with a statement that reports the amount of
public moneys deposited by such governmental unit in the defaulting
bank, savings and loan association or savings bank, the amount of
public moneys that may be insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit
insurance corporation and the amount of public moneys secured by a
pool of securities, or any combination thereof, pursuant to K.S.A. 9-

unit shall verify the information in such report with such governmental
unit's records within 10 business days after receiving the report and
information from the administrator; and
(2) shall repay each governmental unit for the public moneys not
insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation
deposited in the defaulting bank, savings and loan association or
savings bank by the governmental unit upon receipt of a verified report
from such governmental unit. The administrator may liquidate the
securities pledged for immediate distribution if the defaulting bank,
savings and loan association or savings bank is to be liquidated or if,
for any other reason, the administrator determines that public moneys
are not likely to be promptly paid upon demand. In the event that the
amount of the deposit guaranty bond or the proceeds of the securities
held by the administrator after liquidation is insufficient to cover all
public moneys not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit
insurance corporation for all governmental units served by the
administrator, the administrator shall pay out to each governmental unit
available amounts pro rata in accordance with the respective public
moneys not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance
corporation for each such governmental unit.
(b) Any liquidation occurring under the provisions of this section
shall conform to the procedures established in this section. In the event
that a federal deposit insurance agency is appointed and acts as a
liquidator or receiver of any bank, savings and loan association or
savings bank under state or federal law, the duties under this section
that are specified to be performed by the administrator in the event of
default may be delegated to and performed by such federal deposit
insurance agency.
(c) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2026.

bank and provide an itemized list of the securities in such pool. The
governmental unit shall specify the date on which such report shall be
made by such qualified trustee.
(c) This section shall take effect on and after January 1, 2026.

investment of public moneys on behalf of a governmental unit shall not
be permitted to engage in a principal transaction with the governmental
unit that is the same or directly related to the issue of securities or
financial product for which the investment adviser is providing or has
provided advice. Nothing in this section shall prevent governmental
units from engaging with a federally registered investment adviser.

municipality or other political subdivision thereof; and
