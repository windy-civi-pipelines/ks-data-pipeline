13 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:

17 engaged in combat with an enemy force.
18 (b) Each year, the governor shall issue a proclamation recognizing

25 (c) The executive director of the office of veterans services shall

30 (d) All residents of this state are enjoined to devote some portion of
31 purple heart day to recognizing and commemorating the recipients of

33 the ideals that have made this nation great, have served this nation so
34 valiantly and are role models for all to emulate.

34 subject to such automatic revocation or suspension, except for the purpose
35 of establishing the fact of revocation or suspension of the applicant's
36 license, registration or certificate by the applicant's state of residence or
37 jurisdiction in which the applicant held a license, registration or certificate.
38 (h) In the event the licensing body determines that the license,
39 registration or certificate currently held by an applicant under subsection
40 (c)(2) or the work experience or private credential held by an applicant
41 under subsections (e) or (f), who is a military spouse or military
42 servicemember does not authorize a similar scope of practice as the
43 license, registration or certification issued by the licensing body of this

HB 2274—Am. by SC 12
1 state, the licensing body shall issue a temporary permit for a limited period
2 of time to allow the applicant to lawfully practice the applicant's
3 occupation while completing any specific requirements that are required in
4 this state for licensure, registration or certification that were not required
5 in the state, district or territory of the United States in which the applicant
6 was licensed, registered, certified or otherwise credentialed, unless the
7 licensing body finds, based on specific grounds, that issuing a temporary
8 permit would jeopardize the health and safety of the public.
9 (i) In the event the licensing body determines that the license,
10 registration or certification currently held by an applicant under subsection
11 (c)(2) or the work experience or private credential held by an applicant
12 under subsections (e) or (f), who is not a military spouse or military
13 servicemember, does not authorize a similar scope of practice as the
14 license, registration or certification issued by the licensing body of this
15 state, the licensing body may issue a temporary permit for a limited period
16 of time to allow the applicant to lawfully practice the applicant's
17 occupation while completing any specific requirements that are required in
18 this state for licensure, registration or certification that was not required in
19 the state, district or territory of the United States in which the applicant
20 was licensed, registered, certified or otherwise credentialed, unless the

22 permit would jeopardize the health and safety of the public.
23 (j) Any testing, continuing education or training requirements
24 administered under subsection (d), (h) or (i) shall be limited to Kansas law
25 that regulates the occupation and that are materially different from or
26 additional to the law of another state, or shall be limited to any materially
27 different or additional body of knowledge or skill required for the
28 occupational license, registration or certification in Kansas.
29 (k) A licensing body may grant licensure, registration, certification or
30 a temporary permit to any person who meets the requirements under this
31 section but was separated from such military service under less than
32 honorable conditions or with a general discharge under honorable
33 conditions.
34 (l) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply in conflict with
35 or in a manner inconsistent with federal law or a multistate compact, or a
36 rule or regulation or a reciprocal or other applicable statutory provision
37 that would allow an applicant to receive a license. Nothing in this section
38 shall be construed as prohibiting a licensing body from denying any
39 application for licensure, registration or certification, or declining to grant
40 a temporary or probationary license, if the licensing body determines that
41 granting the application may jeopardize the health and safety of the public.
42 (m) Nothing in this section shall be construed to be in conflict with
43 any applicable Kansas statute defining the scope of practice of an

HB 2274—Am. by SC 13
1 occupation. The scope of practice as provided by Kansas law shall apply to
2 applicants under this section.
3 (n) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during a state of
4 emergency declared by the legislature, a licensing body may grant a
5 temporary emergency license to practice any profession licensed, certified,
6 registered or regulated by the licensing body to an applicant whose
7 qualifications the licensing body determines to be sufficient to protect
8 health and safety of the public and may prohibit any unlicensed person
9 from practicing any profession licensed, certified, registered or regulated
10 by the licensing body.
11 (o) Not later than January 1, 2025, licensing bodies shall provide
12 paper-based and verified electronic credentials to persons regulated by the
13 licensing body. A licensing body may prescribe the format or requirements
14 of the electronic credential to be used by the licensing body. Any statutory
15 or regulatory requirement to display, post or produce a credential issued by
16 a licensing body may be satisfied by the proffer of an electronic credential
17 authorized by the licensing body. A licensing body may use a third-party
18 electronic credential system that is not maintained by the licensing body.
19 (p) On or before January 1, 2025, and subject to appropriations
20 therefore, the secretary of administration shall develop and implement a
21 uniform or singular license verification portal for the purpose of verifying
22 or reporting license statuses such as credentials issued, renewed, revoked
23 or suspended by licensing bodies or that have expired or otherwise
24 changed in status. The secretary of administration may utilize the services
25 or facilities of a third party for the central electronic record system. The
26 central electronic record system shall comply with the requirements
27 adopted by the information technology executive council pursuant to
28 K.S.A. 75-7203, and amendments thereto. Beginning January 1, 2025,
29 each licensing body shall be able to integrate with the uniform or singular
30 license verification portal in the manner and format required by the
31 secretary of administration indicating any issuance, renewal, revocation,
32 suspension, expiration or other change in status of an electronic credential
33 that has occurred. No charge for the establishment or maintenance of the
34 uniform or singular license verification portal shall be imposed on any
35 licensing body or any person with a license, registration, certification or
36 permit issued by a licensing body. The centralized electronic credential
37 data management systems shall include an instantaneous verification
38 system that is operated by the licensing body's respective secretary, or the
39 secretary's designee, or the secretary's third-party agent on behalf of the
40 licensing body for the purpose of instantly verifying the authenticity and
41 validity of electronic credentials issued by the licensing body. Centralized
42 electronic credential data management systems shall maintain an auditable
43 record of credentials issued by each licensing body.

HB 2274—Am. by SC 14
1 (q) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or
2 preventing a licensing body from developing, operating, maintaining or
3 using a separate electronic credential system of the licensing body or of a
4 third party in addition to making the reports to the central electronic record
5 system required by subsection (p) or participating in a multistate compact
6 or a reciprocal licensure, registration or certification process as long as the
7 separate electronic credential system of the licensing body integrates with
8 the uniform or singular license verification portal.
9 (r) Each licensing body shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to
10 implement and carry out the provisions of this section.
11 (s) This section shall not apply to the practice of law or the regulation
12 of attorneys pursuant to K.S.A. 7-103, and amendments thereto, or to the

14 enforcement training act, K.S.A. 74-5601 et seq., and amendments thereto.
15 (t) The state board of healing arts and the state board of technical
16 professions, with respect to an applicant who is seeking a license to
17 practice professional engineering or engage in the practice of engineering,
18 as defined in K.S.A. 74-7003, and amendments thereto, may deny an
19 application for licensure, registration or certification, or decline to grant a
20 temporary or probationary license, if the board determines the applicant's
21 qualifications are not substantially equivalent to those established by the
22 board. Such boards shall not otherwise be exempt from the provisions of
23 this act.
24 (u) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary,
25 applicants who are military spouses of active military service members
26 shall be exempt from all fees assessed by any licensing body to obtain an
27 occupational credential in Kansas and renew such credential including
28 initial or renewal application, licensing, registration, certification,
29 endorsement, reciprocity or permit fees and any criminal background
30 report fees, whether assessed by the licensing body or another agency.
