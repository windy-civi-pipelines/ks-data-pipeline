1 or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated or placed
2 before the public, in a newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the
3 form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio or
4 television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement or
5 statement containing any assertion, misrepresentation or statement with
6 respect to the business of insurance or with respect to any person in the
7 conduct of such person's insurance business, that is untrue, deceptive or
8 misleading.
9 (3) Defamation. Making, publishing, disseminating or circulating,
10 directly or indirectly, or aiding, abetting or encouraging the making,
11 publishing, disseminating or circulating of any oral or written statement or
12 any pamphlet, circular, article or literature that is false, or maliciously
13 critical of or derogatory to the financial condition of any person, and that
14 is calculated to injure such person.
15 (4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement
16 to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott,
17 coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable
18 restraint of the business of insurance, or by any act of boycott, coercion or
19 intimidation monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of the
20 business of insurance.
21 (5) False statements and entries. (a) Knowingly filing with any
22 supervisory or other public official, or knowingly making, publishing,
23 disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before
24 the public, or knowingly causing directly or indirectly, to be made,
25 published, disseminated, circulated, delivered to any person, or placed
26 before the public, any false material statement of fact as to the financial
27 condition of a person.
28 (b) Knowingly making any false entry of a material fact in any book,
29 report or statement of any person or knowingly omitting to make a true
30 entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of such person in any
31 book, report or statement of such person.
32 (6) Stock operations and advisory board contracts. Issuing or
33 delivering or permitting agents, officers or employees to issue or deliver,
34 agency company stock or other capital stock, or benefit certificates or
35 shares in any common-law corporation, or securities or any special or
36 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns
37 and profits as an inducement to insurance. Nothing herein shall prohibit
38 the acts permitted by K.S.A. 40-232, and amendments thereto.
39 (7) Unfair discrimination. (a) Making or permitting any unfair
40 discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation
41 of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or life annuity
42 or in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the
43 terms and conditions of such contract.
SB 23—Am. by HC 3
1 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between
2 individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the
3 amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract
4 of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in
5 any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner
6 whatever.
7 (c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
8 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual, or
9 charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage solely
10 because of blindness or partial blindness. With respect to all other
11 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
12 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
13 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
14 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
15 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
16 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
17 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
18 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
19 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.
20 (d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
21 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health
22 and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a
23 different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for
24 losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based
25 on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or
26 may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
27 (d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined
28 in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto, between family members,
29 current or former household members, or current or former intimate
30 partners.
31 (i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health
32 insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may
33 be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek
34 medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse,
35 protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
36 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
37 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
38 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
39 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
40 insurance policy.
41 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
42 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
43 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
SB 23—Am. by HC 4
1 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
2 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
3 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
4 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
5 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
6 based on sound actuarial principles.
7 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
8 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
9 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
10 provided that:
11 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
12 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
13 of abuse;
14 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
15 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
16 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
17 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
18 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
19 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
20 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
21 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
22 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
23 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
24 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
25 effective date of this act.
26 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
27 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
28 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
29 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
30 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
31 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
32 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
33 donors.
34 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
35 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
36 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to
37 such contract other than as plainly expressed in the insurance contract
38 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
39 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any
40 rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage
41 in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or
42 inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or giving, selling,
43 purchasing or offering to give, sell or purchase as inducement to such
SB 23—Am. by HC 5
1 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
2 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,
3 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
4 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
5 (b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including
6 within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the following
7 practices:
8 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
9 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
10 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
11 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
12 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
13 policyholders;
14 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
15 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
16 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
17 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
18 expenses;
19 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
20 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
21 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be
22 made retroactive only for such policy year;
23 (iv) engaging in an arrangement that would not violate section 106 of
24 the bank holding company act amendments of 1972, as interpreted by the
25 board of governors of the federal reserve system or section 5(q) of the
26 home owners' loan act;
27 (v) the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through
28 employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
29 products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services
30 are not specified in the policy of insurance if the product or service:
31 (A) Relates to the insurance coverage; and
32 (B) is primarily designed to satisfy one or more of the following:
33 (1) Provide loss mitigation or loss control;
34 (2) reduce claim costs or claim settlement costs;
35 (3) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons or
36 property;
37 (4) monitor or assess risk, identify sources of risk or develop
38 strategies for eliminating or reducing risk;
39 (5) enhance health;
40 (6) enhance financial wellness through items such as education or
41 financial planning services;
42 (7) provide post-loss services;
43 (8) (a) incentivize behavioral changes to improve the health or reduce
SB 23—Am. by HC 6
1 the risk of death or disability of a customer;
2 (b) as used in this section, "customer" means a policyholder, potential
3 policyholder, certificate holder, potential certificate holder, insured,
4 potential insured or applicant; or
5 (9) assist in the administration of the employee or retiree benefit
6 insurance coverage.
7 (C) The cost to the insurer or producer offering the product or service
8 to any given customer shall be reasonable in comparison to such
9 customer's premiums or insurance coverage for the policy class.
10 (D) If the insurer or producer is providing the product or service
11 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
12 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with
13 questions regarding the product or service.
14 (E) The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations when
15 implementing the permitted practices set forth in this section to ensure
16 consumer protection. Such rules and regulations, consistent with
17 applicable law, may address, among other issues, consumer data
18 protections and privacy, consumer disclosure and unfair discrimination.
19 (F) The availability of the value-added product or service shall be
20 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
21 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
22 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
23 (G) (1) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
24 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
25 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
26 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
27 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall
28 notify the commissioner of such a pilot or testing program offered to
29 consumers in this state prior to launching and may proceed with the
30 program unless the commissioner objects within 21 days of notice.
31 (2) If the insurer or producer is unable to determine sufficient
32 evidence within the one-year pilot or testing period, the insurer or
33 producer may request that such pilot or testing period be extended for
34 such additional time as necessary to determine if the product or service
35 meets the criteria described in subsection (8)(b)(v)(B). Upon such a
36 request, the commissioner may grant an extension of a specified time.
37 (vi) An insurer or a producer may:
38 (A) Offer or give non-cash gifts, items or services, including meals to
39 or charitable donations on behalf of a customer, in connection with the
40 marketing, sale, purchase or retention of contracts of insurance, as long as
41 the cost does not exceed an amount determined to be reasonable by the
42 commissioner per policy year per term. The offer shall be made in a
43 manner that is not unfairly discriminatory. The customer shall not be
SB 23—Am. by HC 7
1 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
2 for the gift, item or service.
3 (B) Conduct raffles or drawings to the extent permitted by state law,
4 as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the drawing
5 or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance, the prizes are
6 not valued in excess of a reasonable amount determined by the
7 commissioner and the drawing or raffle is open to the public. The raffle or
8 drawing shall be offered in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory.
9 The customer shall not be required to purchase, continue to purchase or
10 renew a policy in exchange for the gift, item or service.
11 (c) An insurer, producer or representative of an insurer or producer
12 shall not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the purchase of
13 another policy.
14 (9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement
15 practice if any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining
16 thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such
17 provisions, or committed with such frequency as to indicate a general
18 business practice:
19 (a) Misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions
20 relating to coverages at issue;
21 (b) failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon
22 communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;

30 equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably
31 clear;
32 (g) compelling insureds to institute litigation to recover amounts due
33 under an insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amounts
34 ultimately recovered in actions brought by such insureds;

36 reasonable person would have believed that such person was entitled by
37 reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made
38 part of an application;
39 (i) attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was
40 altered without notice to, or knowledge or consent of the insured;
41 (j) making claims payments to insureds or beneficiaries not
42 accompanied by a statement setting forth the coverage under which
43 payments are being made;
SB 23—Am. by HC 8
1 (k) making known to insureds or claimants a policy of appealing from
2 arbitration awards in favor of insureds or claimants for the purpose of
3 compelling them to accept settlements or compromises less than the
4 amount awarded in arbitration;
5 (l) delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an
6 insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim
7 report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of
8 loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same
9 information;
10 (m) failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become
11 reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in
12 order to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy
13 coverage; or
14 (n) failing to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis
15 in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial
16 of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement.

25 its last examination under K.S.A. 40-222, and amendments thereto; but,
26 except that no such records shall be required for complaints received prior
27 to the effective date of this act. The record shall indicate the total number
28 of complaints, their classification by line of insurance, the nature of each
29 complaint, the disposition of the complaints, the date each complaint was
30 originally received by the insurer and the date of final disposition of each
31 complaint. For purposes of this subsection section, "complaint" means any
32 written communication primarily expressing a grievance related to the acts
33 and practices set out in this section.

SB 23—Am. by HC 9
1 (14)(15) Rebates and other inducements in title insurance. (a) No title
2 insurance company or title insurance agent, or any officer, employee,
3 attorney, agent or solicitor thereof, may pay, allow or give, or offer to pay,
4 allow or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining any title
5 insurance business, any rebate, reduction or abatement of any rate or
6 charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance, any special favor
7 or advantage not generally available to others of the same classification, or
8 any money, thing of value or other consideration or material inducement.
9 The words "Charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance"
10 includes, without limitations, escrow, settlement and closing charges.
11 (b) No insured named in a title insurance policy or contract nor any
12 other person directly or indirectly connected with the transaction involving
13 the issuance of the policy or contract, including, but not limited to,
14 mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, attorney or any officer,
15 employee, agent representative or solicitor thereof, or any other person
16 may knowingly receive or accept, directly or indirectly, any rebate,
17 reduction or abatement of any charge, or any special favor or advantage or
18 any monetary consideration or inducement referred to in subsection (14)(a)
19 (15)(a).
20 (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting:
21 (i) The payment of reasonable fees for services actually rendered to a
22 title insurance agent in connection with a title insurance transaction;

24 insurance agent for services actually performed in the issuance of the

29 between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or one or more
30 title insurance companies and one or more title insurance agents, if such
31 division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate under
32 the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a
33 finder's fee.
34 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) (15)(e) through (14)(i) (15)(i),
35 unless the context otherwise requires:
36 (i) "Associate" means any firm, association, organization, partnership,
37 business trust, corporation or other legal entity organized for profit in

40 second degree by blood or marriage of a producer of title business who is a
41 natural person;, any director, officer or employee of a producer of title
42 business or associate;, any legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is

SB 23—Am. by HC 10
1 any natural person or legal entity with whom a producer of title business or
2 associate has any agreement, arrangement or understanding or pursues any
3 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
4 of this section.
5 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
6 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
7 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
8 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
9 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
10 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
11 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
12 business.
13 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
14 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
15 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
16 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or
17 capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business,

20 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
21 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
22 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
23 money with such interest as security.
24 (v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any
25 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
26 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
27 with respect to the referral.
28 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
29 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
30 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
31 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
32 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
33 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
34 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
35 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
36 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
37 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
38 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
39 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
40 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
41 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
42 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
43 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The
SB 23—Am. by HC 11
1 prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall not apply to transactions
2 involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by
3 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
4 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
5 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent
6 shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which
7 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
8 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
9 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
10 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
11 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
12 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
13 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
14 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
15 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
16 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
17 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
18 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
19 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
20 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
21 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
22 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
23 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
24 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
25 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges
26 generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services. Such
27 disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated
28 to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate
29 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
30 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the

4 rebate pilot programs to exceed one year in duration; amending K.S.A.
5 2024 Supp. 40-2404 and 40-4909 and repealing the existing sections.
6
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-2404 is hereby amended to read as
9 follows: 40-2404. The following are hereby defined as unfair methods of
10 competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the business of
11 insurance:
12 (1) Misrepresentations and false advertising of insurance policies.
13 Making, issuing, circulating or causing to be made, issued or circulated,
14 any estimate, illustration, circular, statement, sales presentation, omission
15 or comparison that:
16 (a) Misrepresents the benefits, advantages, conditions or terms of any
17 insurance policy;
18 (b) misrepresents the dividends or share of the surplus to be received
19 on any insurance policy;
20 (c) makes any false or misleading statements as to the dividends or
21 share of surplus previously paid on any insurance policy;
22 (d) is misleading or is a misrepresentation as to the financial

34 disseminating, circulating or placing before the public, or causing, directly

SB 23—Am. by HC 2
1 or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated or placed
2 before the public, in a newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the
3 form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio or
4 television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement or
5 statement containing any assertion, misrepresentation or statement with
6 respect to the business of insurance or with respect to any person in the
7 conduct of such person's insurance business, that is untrue, deceptive or
8 misleading.
9 (3) Defamation. Making, publishing, disseminating or circulating,
10 directly or indirectly, or aiding, abetting or encouraging the making,
11 publishing, disseminating or circulating of any oral or written statement or
12 any pamphlet, circular, article or literature that is false, or maliciously
13 critical of or derogatory to the financial condition of any person, and that
14 is calculated to injure such person.
15 (4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement
16 to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott,
17 coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable
18 restraint of the business of insurance, or by any act of boycott, coercion or
19 intimidation monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of the
20 business of insurance.
21 (5) False statements and entries. (a) Knowingly filing with any
22 supervisory or other public official, or knowingly making, publishing,
23 disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before
24 the public, or knowingly causing directly or indirectly, to be made,
25 published, disseminated, circulated, delivered to any person, or placed
26 before the public, any false material statement of fact as to the financial
27 condition of a person.
28 (b) Knowingly making any false entry of a material fact in any book,
29 report or statement of any person or knowingly omitting to make a true
30 entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of such person in any
31 book, report or statement of such person.
32 (6) Stock operations and advisory board contracts. Issuing or
33 delivering or permitting agents, officers or employees to issue or deliver,
34 agency company stock or other capital stock, or benefit certificates or
35 shares in any common-law corporation, or securities or any special or
36 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns
37 and profits as an inducement to insurance. Nothing herein shall prohibit
38 the acts permitted by K.S.A. 40-232, and amendments thereto.
39 (7) Unfair discrimination. (a) Making or permitting any unfair
40 discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation
41 of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or life annuity
42 or in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the
43 terms and conditions of such contract.

SB 23—Am. by HC 3
1 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between
2 individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the
3 amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract
4 of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in
5 any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner
6 whatever.
7 (c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
8 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual, or
9 charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage solely
10 because of blindness or partial blindness. With respect to all other
11 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
12 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
13 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
14 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
15 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
16 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
17 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
18 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
19 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.
20 (d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
21 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health
22 and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a
23 different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for
24 losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based
25 on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or
26 may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
27 (d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined
28 in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto, between family members,
29 current or former household members, or current or former intimate
30 partners.
31 (i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health
32 insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may
33 be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek
34 medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse,
35 protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
36 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
37 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
38 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
39 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
40 insurance policy.
41 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
42 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
43 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered

SB 23—Am. by HC 4
1 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
2 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,
3 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
4 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
5 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
6 based on sound actuarial principles.
7 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
8 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
9 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
10 provided that:
11 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
12 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
13 of abuse;
14 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
15 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
16 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
17 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
18 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
19 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
20 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
21 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
22 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
23 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
24 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
25 effective date of this act.
26 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
27 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
28 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
29 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
30 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
31 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
32 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
33 donors.

12 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
13 policyholders;
14 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
15 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a

18 expenses;
19 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
20 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
21 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be

28 employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
29 products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services

19 (F) The availability of the value-added product or service shall be
20 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
21 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
22 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
23 (G) (1) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
24 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
25 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
26 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
27 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall
28 notify the commissioner of such a pilot or testing program offered to

33 producer may request that such pilot or testing period be extended for

35 meets the criteria described in subsection (8)(b)(v)(B). Upon such a
36 request, the commissioner may grant an extension of a specified time.

41 the cost does not exceed an amount determined to be reasonable by the
42 commissioner per policy year per term. The offer shall be made in a
43 manner that is not unfairly discriminatory. The customer shall not be

SB 23—Am. by HC 7
1 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
2 for the gift, item or service.
3 (B) Conduct raffles or drawings to the extent permitted by state law,
4 as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the drawing
5 or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance, the prizes are
6 not valued in excess of a reasonable amount determined by the
7 commissioner and the drawing or raffle is open to the public. The raffle or
8 drawing shall be offered in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory.
9 The customer shall not be required to purchase, continue to purchase or
10 renew a policy in exchange for the gift, item or service.
11 (c) An insurer, producer or representative of an insurer or producer
12 shall not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the purchase of
13 another policy.
14 (9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement
15 practice if any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining
16 thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such

40 altered without notice to, or knowledge or consent of the insured;

26 except that no such records shall be required for complaints received prior
27 to the effective date of this act. The record shall indicate the total number
28 of complaints, their classification by line of insurance, the nature of each

4 allow or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining any title
5 insurance business, any rebate, reduction or abatement of any rate or
6 charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance, any special favor

14 mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, attorney or any officer,
15 employee, agent representative or solicitor thereof, or any other person
16 may knowingly receive or accept, directly or indirectly, any rebate,
17 reduction or abatement of any charge, or any special favor or advantage or

13 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
14 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.

29 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
30 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
31 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
32 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
33 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
34 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
35 business or associate referring the title insurance business.

37 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any

10 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
11 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
12 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
13 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
14 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
15 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
16 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
17 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance

19 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
20 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
21 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
22 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
23 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
24 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the

29 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
30 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
31 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
32 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers

38 other person any loan or extension thereof, credit, sale, property, contract,
39 lease or service, that such other person shall purchase title insurance of any
40 kind through any title agent or title insurer if such producer has a financial
41 interest in such title agent or title insurer.
42 (3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance order
43 or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has reason to

SB 23—Am. by HC 12
1 believe that the name of the title company was pre-printed in the sales
2 contract, prior to the buyer or seller selecting that title company.
3 (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
4 business or associate of such producer from referring title business to any
5 title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice, and, if
6 such producer or associate of such producer has any financial interest in
7 the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends produced or
8 realized from such financial interest, so long as if:
9 (a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
10 insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
11 (b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange for
12 the referral of business; and
13 (c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a return
14 on the investment of the producer or associate.
15 (5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer who
16 violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any title
17 insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance knowing that
18 it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in addition to any other
19 action that may be taken by the commissioner of insurance, shall be
20 subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount equal to five times the
21 premium for the title insurance and, if licensed pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034
22 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be deemed to have committed a
23 prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3602, and amendments thereto, and
24 shall be liable to the purchaser of such title insurance in an amount equal
25 to the premium for the title insurance.
26 (6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
27 insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act, has
28 violated or is violating the provisions of this paragraph, shall have a cause
29 of action against such title insurer or title agent and, upon establishing the
30 existence of a violation of any such provision, shall be entitled, in addition
31 to any other damages or remedies provided by law, to such equitable or
32 injunctive relief as the court deems proper. In any such action under this
33 subsection, the court may award to the successful party the court costs of
34 the action together with reasonable attorney fees.
35 (7) The commissioner shall also require each title agent to provide
36 core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures act.
37 (j) The commissioner shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary
38 to carry out the provisions of this act.
39 (15)(16) Disclosure of nonpublic personal information. (a) No person
40 shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to the
41 provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (, public law
42 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations necessary to
43 carry out this subsection. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent

SB 23—Am. by HC 13
1 with and not more restrictive than the model regulation adopted on
2 September 26, 2000, by the national association of insurance
3 commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer financial and health
4 information regulation"."
5 (b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
6 authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,
7 supersedes or is inconsistent with any provision of Kansas law concerning
8 requirements for notification of, or obtaining consent from, a parent,
9 guardian or other legal custodian of a minor relating to any matter
10 pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
