SB 23—Am. by SC 2
1 form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio or
2 television station, or in any other way, an advertisement, announcement or

5 conduct of such person's insurance business, that is untrue, deceptive or
6 misleading.
7 (3) Defamation. Making, publishing, disseminating or circulating,
8 directly or indirectly, or aiding, abetting or encouraging the making,
9 publishing, disseminating or circulating of any oral or written statement or
10 any pamphlet, circular, article or literature that is false, or maliciously
11 critical of or derogatory to the financial condition of any person, and that
12 is calculated to injure such person.
13 (4) Boycott, coercion and intimidation. Entering into any agreement
14 to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott,
15 coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable
16 restraint of the business of insurance, or by any act of boycott, coercion or
17 intimidation monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of the
18 business of insurance.
19 (5) False statements and entries. (a) Knowingly filing with any
20 supervisory or other public official, or knowingly making, publishing,
21 disseminating, circulating or delivering to any person, or placing before
22 the public, or knowingly causing directly or indirectly, to be made,
23 published, disseminated, circulated, delivered to any person, or placed

27 report or statement of any person or knowingly omitting to make a true
28 entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of such person in any
29 book, report or statement of such person.
30 (6) Stock operations and advisory board contracts. Issuing or
31 delivering or permitting agents, officers or employees to issue or deliver,
32 agency company stock or other capital stock, or benefit certificates or
33 shares in any common-law corporation, or securities or any special or
34 advisory board contracts or other contracts of any kind promising returns
35 and profits as an inducement to insurance. Nothing herein shall prohibit
36 the acts permitted by K.S.A. 40-232, and amendments thereto.
37 (7) Unfair discrimination. (a) Making or permitting any unfair
38 discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation
39 of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or life annuity
40 or in the dividends or other benefits payable thereon, or in any other of the
41 terms and conditions of such contract.
42 (b) Making or permitting any unfair discrimination between
43 individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the

SB 23—Am. by SC 3
1 amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract
2 of accident or health insurance or in the benefits payable thereunder, or in
3 any of the terms or conditions of such contract, or in any other manner
4 whatever.
5 (c) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
6 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual, or
7 charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage solely
8 because of blindness or partial blindness. With respect to all other
9 conditions, including the underlying cause of the blindness or partial
10 blindness, persons who are blind or partially blind shall be subject to the
11 same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably
12 anticipated experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure includes
13 denial by an insurer of disability insurance coverage on the grounds that
14 the policy defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the
15 insured loses such person's eyesight. However, an insurer may exclude
16 from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or partial
17 blindness when such condition existed at the time the policy was issued.
18 (d) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
19 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for accident and health
20 and life insurance to an applicant who is the proposed insured or charge a
21 different rate for the same coverage or excluding or limiting coverage for
22 losses or denying a claim incurred by an insured as a result of abuse based
23 on the fact that the applicant who is the proposed insured is, has been, or
24 may be the subject of domestic abuse, except as provided in subsection (7)
25 (d)(v). "Abuse" as used in this paragraph means one or more acts defined
26 in K.S.A. 60-3102, and amendments thereto, between family members,
27 current or former household members, or current or former intimate
28 partners.
29 (i) An insurer may not ask an applicant for life or accident and health
30 insurance who is the proposed insured if the individual is, has been or may
31 be the subject of domestic abuse or seeks, has sought or had reason to seek
32 medical or psychological treatment or counseling specifically for abuse,
33 protection from abuse or shelter from abuse.
34 (ii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
35 from declining to issue an insurance policy insuring the life of an
36 individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of abuse if
37 the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the owner of the
38 insurance policy.
39 (iii) No insurer that issues a life or accident and health policy to an
40 individual who is, has been or may be the subject of domestic abuse shall
41 be subject to civil or criminal liability for the death or any injuries suffered
42 by that individual as a result of domestic abuse.
43 (iv) No person shall refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure,

SB 23—Am. by SC 4
1 limit the amount, extent or kind of coverage available to an individual or
2 charge a different rate for the same coverage solely because of physical or
3 mental condition, except where the refusal, limitation or rate differential is
4 based on sound actuarial principles.
5 (v) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
6 from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical or
7 mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
8 provided that:
9 (A) The person routinely underwrites or rates such condition in the
10 same manner with respect to an insured or an applicant who is not a victim
11 of abuse;
12 (B) the fact that an individual is, has been or may be the subject of
13 abuse may not be considered a physical or mental condition; and
14 (C) such underwriting or rating is not used to evade the intent of this
15 section or any other provision of the Kansas insurance code.
16 (vi) Any person who underwrites or rates a risk on the basis of
17 preexisting physical or mental condition as set forth in subsection (7)(d)
18 (v), shall treat such underwriting or rating as an adverse underwriting
19 decision pursuant to K.S.A. 40-2,112, and amendments thereto.
20 (vii) The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to all policies of life
21 and accident and health insurance issued in this state after the effective
22 date of this act and all existing contracts that are renewed on or after the
23 effective date of this act.
24 (e) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, or limiting
25 the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
26 individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same coverage,
27 solely because of such individual's status as a living organ donor. With
28 respect to all other conditions, persons who are living organ donors shall
29 be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial principles or actual or
30 reasonably anticipated experience as are persons who are not organ
31 donors.
32 (8) Rebates. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
33 knowingly permitting, offering to make or making any contract of life
34 insurance, life annuity or accident and health insurance, or agreement as to
35 such contract other than as plainly expressed in the insurance contract
36 issued thereon; paying, allowing, giving or offering to pay, allow or give,
37 directly or indirectly, as inducement to such insurance, or annuity, any
38 rebate of premiums payable on the contract, any special favor or advantage
39 in the dividends or other benefits thereon, or any valuable consideration or
40 inducement whatever not specified in the contract; or giving, selling,
41 purchasing or offering to give, sell or purchase as inducement to such
42 insurance contract or annuity or in connection therewith, any stocks, bonds
43 or other securities of any insurance company or other corporation,

SB 23—Am. by SC 5
1 association or partnership, or any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or
2 anything of value whatsoever not specified in the contract.
3 (b) Nothing in subsection (7) or (8)(a) shall be construed as including
4 within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the following
5 practices:
6 (i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity, paying
7 bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in whole or
8 in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating insurance. Any
9 such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair and equitable to
10 policyholders and for the best interests of the company and its
11 policyholders;
12 (ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial debit
13 plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously for a
14 specified period made premium payments directly to an office of the
15 insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
16 expenses;
17 (iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance policy
18 based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of the first
19 or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which may be
20 made retroactive only for such policy year;
21 (iv) engaging in an arrangement that would not violate section 106 of
22 the bank holding company act amendments of 1972, as interpreted by the
23 board of governors of the federal reserve system or section 5(q) of the
24 home owners' loan act;
25 (v) the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through
26 employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
27 products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or services
28 are not specified in the policy of insurance if the product or service:
29 (A) Relates to the insurance coverage; and
30 (B) is primarily designed to satisfy one or more of the following:
31 (1) Provide loss mitigation or loss control;
32 (2) reduce claim costs or claim settlement costs;
33 (3) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons or
34 property;
35 (4) monitor or assess risk, identify sources of risk or develop
36 strategies for eliminating or reducing risk;
37 (5) enhance health;
38 (6) enhance financial wellness through items such as education or
39 financial planning services;
40 (7) provide post-loss services;
41 (8) (a) incentivize behavioral changes to improve the health or reduce
42 the risk of death or disability of a customer;
43 (b) as used in this section, "customer" means a policyholder, potential

SB 23—Am. by SC 6
1 policyholder, certificate holder, potential certificate holder, insured,
2 potential insured or applicant; or
3 (9) assist in the administration of the employee or retiree benefit
4 insurance coverage.
5 (C) The cost to the insurer or producer offering the product or service
6 to any given customer shall be reasonable in comparison to such
7 customer's premiums or insurance coverage for the policy class.
8 (D) If the insurer or producer is providing the product or service
9 offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is provided
10 with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer with
11 questions regarding the product or service.
12 (E) The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations when
13 implementing the permitted practices set forth in this section to ensure
14 consumer protection. Such rules and regulations, consistent with
15 applicable law, may address, among other issues, consumer data
16 protections and privacy, consumer disclosure and unfair discrimination.
17 (F) The availability of the value-added product or service shall be
18 based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is not
19 unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be maintained by
20 the insurer or producer and produced upon request by the commissioner.
21 (G) (1) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence but
22 has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria in
23 subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the product or
24 service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part of a pilot or
25 testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or producer shall
26 notify the commissioner of such a pilot or testing program offered to
27 consumers in this state prior to launching and may proceed with the
28 program unless the commissioner objects within 21 days of notice.
29 (2) If the insurer or producer is unable to determine sufficient
30 evidence within the one-year pilot or testing period, the insurer or
31 producer may request that such pilot or testing period be extended for
32 such additional time as necessary to determine if the product or service
33 meets the criteria described in subsection (8)(b)(v)(B). Upon such a
34 request, the commissioner may grant an extension of a specified time.
35 (vi) An insurer or a producer may:
36 (A) Offer or give non-cash gifts, items or services, including meals to
37 or charitable donations on behalf of a customer, in connection with the
38 marketing, sale, purchase or retention of contracts of insurance, as long as
39 the cost does not exceed an amount determined to be reasonable by the
40 commissioner per policy year per term. The offer shall be made in a
41 manner that is not unfairly discriminatory. The customer shall not be
42 required to purchase, continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange
43 for the gift, item or service.

SB 23—Am. by SC 7
1 (B) Conduct raffles or drawings to the extent permitted by state law,
2 as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the drawing
3 or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance, the prizes are
4 not valued in excess of a reasonable amount determined by the
5 commissioner and the drawing or raffle is open to the public. The raffle or
6 drawing shall be offered in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory.
7 The customer shall not be required to purchase, continue to purchase or
8 renew a policy in exchange for the gift, item or service.
9 (c) An insurer, producer or representative of an insurer or producer
10 shall not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the purchase of
11 another policy.
12 (9) Unfair claim settlement practices. It is an unfair claim settlement
13 practice if any of the following or any rules and regulations pertaining
14 thereto are either committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of such
15 provisions, or committed with such frequency as to indicate a general
16 business practice:
17 (a) Misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions
18 relating to coverages at issue;
19 (b) failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon
20 communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies;

28 equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably
29 clear;
30 (g) compelling insureds to institute litigation to recover amounts due
31 under an insurance policy by offering substantially less than the amounts
32 ultimately recovered in actions brought by such insureds;

34 reasonable person would have believed that such person was entitled by
35 reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made
36 part of an application;
37 (i) attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was
38 altered without notice to, or knowledge or consent of the insured;

40 accompanied by a statement setting forth the coverage under which
41 payments are being made;
42 (k) making known to insureds or claimants a policy of appealing from
43 arbitration awards in favor of insureds or claimants for the purpose of

SB 23—Am. by SC 8
1 compelling them to accept settlements or compromises less than the
2 amount awarded in arbitration;
3 (l) delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an
4 insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim

7 information;
8 (m) failing to promptly settle claims, where liability has become

10 order to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy
11 coverage; or

24 except that no such records shall be required for complaints received prior
25 to the effective date of this act. The record shall indicate the total number
26 of complaints, their classification by line of insurance, the nature of each
27 complaint, the disposition of the complaints, the date each complaint was
28 originally received by the insurer and the date of final disposition of each
29 complaint. For purposes of this subsection section, "complaint" means any
30 written communication primarily expressing a grievance related to the acts
31 and practices set out in this section.

42 (14)(15) Rebates and other inducements in title insurance. (a) No title
43 insurance company or title insurance agent, or any officer, employee,

SB 23—Am. by SC 9
1 attorney, agent or solicitor thereof, may pay, allow or give, or offer to pay,
2 allow or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining any title
3 insurance business, any rebate, reduction or abatement of any rate or
4 charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance, any special favor
5 or advantage not generally available to others of the same classification, or
6 any money, thing of value or other consideration or material inducement.
7 The words "Charge made incident to the issuance of such insurance"
8 includes, without limitations, escrow, settlement and closing charges.
9 (b) No insured named in a title insurance policy or contract nor any
10 other person directly or indirectly connected with the transaction involving
11 the issuance of the policy or contract, including, but not limited to,
12 mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, attorney or any officer,
13 employee, agent representative or solicitor thereof, or any other person
14 may knowingly receive or accept, directly or indirectly, any rebate,
15 reduction or abatement of any charge, or any special favor or advantage or

27 between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or one or more
28 title insurance companies and one or more title insurance agents, if such
29 division of rates and charges does not constitute an unlawful rebate under
30 the provisions of this section and is not in payment of a forwarding fee or a
31 finder's fee.
32 (e) As used in subsections (14)(e) (15)(e) through (14)(i) (15)(i),
33 unless the context otherwise requires:

SB 23—Am. by SC 10
1 course of conduct, the purpose or effect of which is to evade the provisions
2 of this section.
3 (ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal or
4 beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or more of
5 the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest is held.
6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or any other
7 type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the primary purpose
8 of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the financial benefit to be
9 obtained as a consequence of that interest from the referral of title
10 business.
11 (iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
12 cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
13 (iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,
14 including any officer, director or owner of 5% or more of the equity or
15 capital or both of any person, engaged in this state in the trade, business,

18 (B) making loans secured by interests in real property; or
19 (C) acting as broker, agent, representative or attorney for a person
20 who buys or sells any interest in real property or who lends or borrows
21 money with such interest as security.
22 (v) "Refer" means to direct or cause to be directed or to exercise any
23 power or influence over the direction of title insurance business, whether
24 or not the consent or approval of any other person is sought or obtained
25 with respect to the referral.
26 (f) No title insurer or title agent may accept any order for, issue a title
27 insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows or has
28 reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any producer of
29 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
30 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
31 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed to the
32 buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the producer of title
33 business or associate referring the title insurance business.
34 (g) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
35 insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain any
36 premium, or charge in connection with any transaction if: (i) The title
37 insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the transaction
38 will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or title agent; and
39 (ii) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that title insurer or title agent
40 during the 12 full calendar months immediately preceding the month in
41 which the transaction takes place is derived from controlled business. The
42 prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall not apply to transactions
43 involving real estate located in a county that has a population, as shown by

SB 23—Am. by SC 11
1 the last preceding decennial census, of 10,000 or less.
2 (h) Within 90 days following the end of each business year, as
3 established by the title insurer or title agent, each title insurer or title agent
4 shall file with the department of insurance and any title insurer with which
5 the title agent maintains an underwriting agreement, a report executed by
6 the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive officer or designee, under
7 penalty of perjury, stating the percent of closed title orders originating
8 from controlled business. The failure of a title insurer or title agent to
9 comply with the requirements of this section, at the discretion of the
10 commissioner, shall be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a
11 license or other disciplinary action, with the commissioner able to mitigate
12 any such disciplinary action if the title insurer or title agent is found to be
13 in substantial compliance with competitive behavior as defined by federal
14 housing and urban development statement of policy 1996-2.
15 (i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
16 order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
17 reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
18 title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer, the
19 associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title agent
20 to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in writing
21 to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate has a
22 financial interest in the title insurer or title agent, the nature of the
23 financial interest and a written estimate of the charge or range of charges
24 generally made by the title insurer or agent for the title services. Such
25 disclosure shall include language stating that the consumer is not obligated
26 to use the title insurer or agent in which the referring producer or associate
27 has a financial interest and shall include the names and telephone numbers
28 of not less than three other title insurers or agents that operate in the
29 county in which the property is located. If fewer than three insurers or
30 agents operate in that county, the disclosure shall include all title insurers
31 or agents operating in that county. Such written disclosure shall be signed
32 by the person so referred and must have occurred prior to any commitment
