42 the licensee's compact privilege in all other member states shall be revoked
43 until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All
HB 2070 9
1 home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a
2 licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are

7 administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in
8 any remote state.

19 describe all matters discussed in a meeting and provide a full and accurate
20 summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a
21 description of the views expressed. All documents considered in
22 connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes
23 and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to

33 assessment from each member state and impose fees on licensees of
34 member states to whom it grants a compact privilege to cover the cost of
35 the operations and activities of the compact commission and its staff that
36 shall, in a total amount, be sufficient to cover its annual budget as
37 approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources.
38 The aggregate annual assessment amount for member states shall be
39 allocated based upon a formula that the compact commission shall
40 promulgate by rule.
41 (4) The compact commission shall not incur obligations of any kind

19 this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or
20 liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional
21 or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The procurement of
22 insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way
23 compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
24 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer,
25 executive director, employee and representative of the compact
26 commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
27 any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope
28 of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities or as
29 determined by the compact commission that the person against whom the
30 claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
31 scope of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities,
32 except that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from
33 retaining their own counsel at their own expense and that the actual or
34 alleged act, error or omission did not result from that person's intentional
35 or willful or wanton misconduct.
36 (3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any
37 member, officer, executive director, employee and representative of the
38 compact commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment

41 employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such person had a
42 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact
43 commission employment, duties or responsibilities, except that the actual
HB 2070 15
1 or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or
2 willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
3 (4) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on the
4 liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which
5 shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
6 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
7 abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state action affirmative
8 defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman antitrust act of
9 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27 or any other state or federal
10 antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.

32 denial;
33 (6) the presence of current significant investigative information; and
34 (7) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
35 compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the rules of the
36 compact commission.
37 (d) The records and information provided to a member state pursuant

42 proceedings in a member state.
43 (e) Current significant investigative information pertaining to a
HB 2070 16
1 licensee in any member state shall only be available to other member
2 states.
3 (f) Member states shall report any adverse action against a licensee

14 SECTION 10—RULEMAKING
15 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in
16 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
17 and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or
18 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid
19 because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
20 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the
21 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
22 review.
23 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law
24 in each member state, except that where the rules conflict with the laws or
25 regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions and
26 processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the
27 circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of
28 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be
29 ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
30 (c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
31 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted
32 thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or
33 as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
34 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
35 or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
36 manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption
37 of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any
38 member state.
39 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
40 compact commission.
41 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission
42 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written
43 comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments.
HB 2070 17
1 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission
2 and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact
3 commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact
4 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
5 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly
6 accessible platform;
7 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the compact
8 commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and
9 (3) in such other way as the compact commission may by rule
10 specify.
11 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
12 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the
13 compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and,
14 if different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the compact
15 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
16 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference or
17 other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the
18 mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
19 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
20 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
21 person; and
22 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written
23 comments.
24 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
25 written comments and documents received by the compact commission in
26 response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
27 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
28 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
29 compact commission at hearings required by this section.
30 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
31 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and
32 the full text of the rule.
33 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule
34 if the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
35 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the
36 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
37 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
38 commenters.
39 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective
40 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l),
41 the effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after issuing
42 the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
43 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact
HB 2070 18
1 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
2 notice, with an opportunity to comment, except that the usual rulemaking
3 procedures provided in the compact and this section shall be retroactively
4 applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but not later than 90 days
5 after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
6 emergency rule is one that shall be adopted immediately in order to:
7 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
8 (2) prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
9 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established
10 by federal law or rule; or
11 (4) protect public health and safety.
12 (m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the
13 compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for
14 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
15 consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be
16 posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be
17 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.
18 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results
19 in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
20 delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period.
21 If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further
22 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
23 without the approval of the compact commission.
24 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
25 compact.
26 SECTION 11—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
27 ENFORCEMENT
28 (a) Oversight.
29 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
30 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
31 appropriate to implement this compact.
32 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and
33 judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
34 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where
35 the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact
36 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
37 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
38 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
39 of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
40 misconduct or any such similar matter.
41 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
42 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of
43 the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for
HB 2070 19
1 all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process
2 shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this
3 compact or promulgated rules.
4 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
5 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has
6 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
7 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
8 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
9 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
10 other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training
11 and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
12 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
13 default to the other member states.
14 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
15 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
16 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
17 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
18 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
19 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
20 default.
21 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
22 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
23 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact
24 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
25 defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority and
26 each of the member states' licensing authority.
27 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
28 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
29 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
30 termination.
31 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact,
32 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
33 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
34 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six
35 months after the date of said notice of termination.
36 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
37 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact,
38 unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the
39 defaulting state.
40 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact
41 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
42 of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its
43 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
HB 2070 20
1 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
2 (i) Dispute resolution.
3 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall
4 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among
5 member states and among member and nonmember states.
6 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
7 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
8 (j) Enforcement.
9 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal
10 action against a member state in default in the United States district court
11 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
12 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
13 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may
14 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial
15 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
16 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein
17 shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The
18 compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under
19 federal or the defaulting member state's law.
20 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
21 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
22 or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
23 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
24 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
25 damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
26 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
27 attorney fees.
28 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact
29 against the compact commission.
30 SECTION 12—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
31 AMENDMENT
32 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
33 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
34 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact
35 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
36 seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the statute
37 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
38 model compact statute.
39 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
40 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the
41 default process set forth in section 11.
42 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
43 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall
HB 2070 21
1 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
2 number of member states should be fewer than seven.
3 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
4 initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
5 section 8(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
6 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation
7 in the compact.
8 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in
9 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
10 the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into
11 existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission
12 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
13 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
14 commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
15 the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes
16 law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact
17 commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the
18 compact becomes law in that state.
19 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
20 statute repealing such compact.
21 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
22 after enactment of the repealing statute.
23 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
24 withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
25 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
26 effective date of withdrawal.
27 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
28 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
29 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
30 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
31 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180
32 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
33 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
34 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
35 between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with
36 the provisions of this compact.
37 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
38 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
39 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
40 SECTION 13—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
41 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority
42 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
43 implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
HB 2070 22
1 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall
2 not be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority
3 solely for those purposes.
4 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
5 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
6 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
7 state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the United States,
8 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
9 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
10 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
11 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
12 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
13 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the compact commission may
14 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
15 requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation in
16 the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member
17 state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact shall be
18 held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
19 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
20 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
21 matters.
22 SECTION 14—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
23 OTHER STATE LAWS
24 (a) Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement
25 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
26 compact.
27 (b) Any laws, statutes, rules and regulations or other legal
28 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are
29 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
30 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and
31 the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
32 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
33 publication in the statute book.

39 home state.
40 SECTION 5—OBTAINING A NEW HOME STATE LICENSE BASED
41 ON A COMPACT PRIVILEGE
42

2 time.
3 (b) If a licensee changes home state by moving between two member
4 states:
5 (1) The licensee shall file an application for obtaining a new home

19 into a compact privilege once the new home state has activated the new
20 home state license in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the
21 compact commission.
22 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this compact, if the
23 licensee cannot meet the criteria in section 4, the new home state may

26 order to be issued a new home state license.
27 (c) If a licensee changes their state of residence by moving from a

29 member state, the state criteria shall apply for issuance of a single state
30 license in the new state.
31 (d) Nothing in this compact shall interfere with a licensee's ability to
32 hold a single state license in multiple states, except that for the purposes of
33 this compact, a licensee shall have only one home state license.
34 (e) Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established
35 by a member state for the issuance of a single state license.
36 SECTION 6—ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS OR THEIR SPOUSES
37 An active military member, or their spouse, shall designate a home

41 SECTION 7—ADVERSE ACTIONS
42 (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote
43 state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process

1 law, to:
2 (1) Take adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege within
3 that member state; and
4 (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
5 the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of
6 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a member state for
7 the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence
8 from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court
9 of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure
10 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before that court.
11 The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage
12 and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the
13 witnesses or evidence are located.
14 (b) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action
15 against a licensee's home state license.
16 (c) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give
17 the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member
18 state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state. In so
19 doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
20 appropriate action.
21 (d) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a
22 licensee who changes home states during the course of the investigations.
23 The home state shall also have authority to take appropriate action and
24 promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator
25 of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly
26 notify the new home state of any adverse actions.
27 (e) A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover
28 from the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of
29 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
30 (f) A member state may take adverse action based on the factual
31 findings of another remote state if the member state follows its own
32 procedures for taking the adverse action.
33 (g) Joint investigations.
34 (1) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its
35 respective state law, any member state may participate with other member
36 states in joint investigations of licensees.
37 (2) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation or
38 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint investigation initiated
39 under the compact.
40 (h) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's
41 home state license resulting in an encumbrance on the home state license,
42 the licensee's compact privilege in all other member states shall be revoked
43 until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All

HB 2070 9
1 home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a
2 licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are
3 revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.
4 (i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an
5 unencumbered license as certified by the home state's licensing authority,
6 the licensee shall meet the requirements of section 4(a) and follow the
7 administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in
8 any remote state.
9 (j) If a member state takes adverse action, such state shall promptly
10 notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data
11 system shall promptly notify the other member states state of any adverse
12 actions.
13 (k) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's decision
14 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
15 action.

19 this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or
20 liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional
21 or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The procurement of
22 insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way
23 compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
24 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer,
25 executive director, employee and representative of the compact
26 commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
27 any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope

29 determined by the compact commission that the person against whom the

31 scope of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities,
32 except that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from

41 employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such person had a
42 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact

HB 2070 15
1 or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or
2 willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
3 (4) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on the
4 liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which
5 shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.

9 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27 or any other state or federal

32 denial;
33 (6) the presence of current significant investigative information; and
34 (7) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
35 compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the rules of the
36 compact commission.
37 (d) The records and information provided to a member state pursuant
38 to this compact or through the data system, when certified by the compact

14 SECTION 10—RULEMAKING
15 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in
16 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
17 and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or
18 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid
19 because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
20 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the
21 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
22 review.
23 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law
24 in each member state, except that where the rules conflict with the laws or
25 regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions and
26 processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the
27 circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of
28 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be
29 ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
30 (c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
31 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted
32 thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or
33 as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
34 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
35 or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
36 manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption
37 of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any
38 member state.
39 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
40 compact commission.
41 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission
42 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written
43 comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments.

HB 2070 17
1 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission
2 and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact
3 commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact
4 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
5 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly
6 accessible platform;
7 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the compact
8 commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and
9 (3) in such other way as the compact commission may by rule
10 specify.
11 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
12 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the
13 compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and,
14 if different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the compact
15 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
16 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference or
17 other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the
18 mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
19 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
20 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
21 person; and
22 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written
23 comments.
24 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
25 written comments and documents received by the compact commission in
26 response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
27 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
28 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
29 compact commission at hearings required by this section.
30 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
31 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and
32 the full text of the rule.
33 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule
34 if the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
35 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the
36 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
37 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
38 commenters.
39 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective
40 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l),
41 the effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after issuing
42 the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
43 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact

HB 2070 18
1 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
2 notice, with an opportunity to comment, except that the usual rulemaking
3 procedures provided in the compact and this section shall be retroactively
4 applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but not later than 90 days
5 after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
6 emergency rule is one that shall be adopted immediately in order to:
7 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
8 (2) prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
9 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established
10 by federal law or rule; or
11 (4) protect public health and safety.
12 (m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the
13 compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for
14 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
15 consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be
16 posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be
17 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.
18 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results
19 in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
20 delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period.
21 If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further
22 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
23 without the approval of the compact commission.
24 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
25 compact.
26 SECTION 11—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
27 ENFORCEMENT
28 (a) Oversight.
29 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
30 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
31 appropriate to implement this compact.
32 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and
33 judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
34 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where
35 the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact
36 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
37 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
38 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
39 of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
40 misconduct or any such similar matter.
41 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
42 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of
43 the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for

HB 2070 19
1 all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process
2 shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this
3 compact or promulgated rules.
4 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
5 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has
6 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
7 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
8 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
9 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
10 other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training
11 and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
12 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
13 default to the other member states.
14 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
15 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
16 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
17 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
18 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
19 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
20 default.
21 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
22 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
23 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact
24 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
25 defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority and
26 each of the member states' licensing authority.
27 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
28 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
29 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
30 termination.
31 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact,
32 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
33 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
34 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six
35 months after the date of said notice of termination.
36 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
37 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact,
38 unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the
39 defaulting state.
40 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact
41 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
42 of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its
43 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such

HB 2070 20
1 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
2 (i) Dispute resolution.
3 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall
4 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among
5 member states and among member and nonmember states.
6 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
7 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
8 (j) Enforcement.
9 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal
10 action against a member state in default in the United States district court
11 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
12 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
13 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may
14 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial
15 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
16 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein
17 shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The
18 compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under
19 federal or the defaulting member state's law.
20 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
21 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
22 or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
23 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
24 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
25 damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
26 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
27 attorney fees.
28 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact
29 against the compact commission.
30 SECTION 12—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
31 AMENDMENT
32 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
33 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
34 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact
35 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
36 seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the statute
37 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
38 model compact statute.
39 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
40 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the
41 default process set forth in section 11.
42 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
43 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall

HB 2070 21
1 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
2 number of member states should be fewer than seven.
3 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
4 initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
5 section 8(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
6 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation
7 in the compact.
8 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in
9 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
10 the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into
11 existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission
12 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
13 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
14 commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
15 the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes
16 law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact
17 commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the
18 compact becomes law in that state.
19 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
20 statute repealing such compact.
21 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
22 after enactment of the repealing statute.
23 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
24 withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
25 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
26 effective date of withdrawal.
27 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
28 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
29 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
30 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
31 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180
32 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
33 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
34 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
35 between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with
36 the provisions of this compact.
37 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
38 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
39 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
40 SECTION 13—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
41 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority
42 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
43 implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the

HB 2070 22
1 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall
2 not be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority
3 solely for those purposes.
4 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
5 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
6 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
7 state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the United States,
8 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
9 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
10 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
11 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
12 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
13 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the compact commission may
14 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
15 requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation in
16 the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member
17 state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact shall be
18 held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
