43 the licensee's compact privilege in all other member states shall be revoked
HB 2070—Am. by HC 9
1 until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All
2 home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a

7 the licensee shall meet the requirements of section 4(a) and follow the
8 administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in
9 any remote state.
10 (j) If a member state takes adverse action, such state shall promptly

9 behalf of or for use of the compact commission or other committee
10 charged with responsibility of investigation or determination of
11 compliance issues pursuant to the compact;
12 (K) matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal or
13 member state law; or
14 (L) other matters as specified in the rules of the compact commission.
15 (3) If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed, the presiding
16 officer shall state that the meeting will be closed and reference each
17 relevant exempting provision, and such reference shall be recorded in the
18 minutes.
19 (4) The compact commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly
20 describe all matters discussed in a meeting and provide a full and accurate
21 summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a
22 description of the views expressed. All documents considered in
23 connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes
24 and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to
25 release only by a majority vote of the compact commission or order of a
26 court of competent jurisdiction.
27 (g) Financing of the compact commission.
28 (1) The compact commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of,
29 the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing
30 activities.
31 (2) The compact commission may accept any and all appropriate
32 revenue sources as provided in subsection (c)(13).
33 (3) The compact commission may levy on and collect an annual
34 assessment from each member state and impose fees on licensees of
35 member states to whom it grants a compact privilege to cover the cost of
36 the operations and activities of the compact commission and its staff that
37 shall, in a total amount, be sufficient to cover its annual budget as
38 approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources.
39 The aggregate annual assessment amount for member states shall be
40 allocated based upon a formula that the compact commission shall
41 promulgate by rule.
42 (4) The compact commission shall not incur obligations of any kind
43 prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same, nor shall the
HB 2070—Am. by HC 14
1 compact commission pledge the credit of any of the member states except
2 by and with the authority of the member state.
3 (5) The compact commission shall keep accurate accounts of all
4 receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the compact
5 commission shall be subject to the financial review and accounting
6 procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of
7 funds handled by the compact commission shall be subject to an annual
8 financial review by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report
9 of the financial review shall be included in and become part of the annual
10 report of the compact commission.
11 (h) Qualified immunity, defense and indemnification.
12 (1) The members, officers, executive director, employees and
13 representatives of the compact commission shall be immune from suit and
14 liability, both personally and in their official capacity, for any claim for
15 damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability
16 caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that
17 occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a
18 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact
19 commission employment, duties or responsibilities, except that nothing in
20 this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or
21 liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional
22 or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The procurement of
23 insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way
24 compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
25 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer,
26 executive director, employee and representative of the compact
27 commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
28 any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope
29 of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities or as
30 determined by the compact commission that the person against whom the
31 claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the
32 scope of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities,
33 except that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from
34 retaining their own counsel at their own expense and that the actual or
35 alleged act, error or omission did not result from that person's intentional
36 or willful or wanton misconduct.
37 (3) The compact commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any
38 member, officer, executive director, employee and representative of the
39 compact commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment
40 obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error
41 or omission that occurred within the scope of compact commission
42 employment, duties or responsibilities, or that such person had a
43 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of compact
HB 2070—Am. by HC 15
1 commission employment, duties or responsibilities, except that the actual
2 or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or
3 willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
4 (4) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on the
5 liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which
6 shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
7 (5) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
8 abrogate a member state's state action immunity or state action affirmative
9 defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman antitrust act of
10 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27 or any other state or federal
11 antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.
12 (6) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
13 sovereign immunity by the member states or by the compact commission.
14 SECTION 9—DATA SYSTEMS
15 (a) The compact commission shall provide for the development,
16 maintenance, operation and utilization of a coordinated data system.
17 (b) The compact commission shall assign each applicant for a
18 compact privilege a unique identifier, as determined by the rules of the
19 compact commission.
20 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a
21 member state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on all
22 individuals to whom this compact is applicable as required by the rules of
23 the compact commission, including:
24 (1) Identifying information;
25 (2) licensure data;
26 (3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege and
27 information related thereto;
28 (4) nonconfidential information related to alternative program
29 participation, the beginning and ending dates of such participation and
30 other information related to such participation not made confidential under
31 member state law;
32 (5) any denial of application for licensure and the reason for such
33 denial;
34 (6) the presence of current significant investigative information; and
35 (7) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
36 compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the rules of the
37 compact commission.
38 (d) The records and information provided to a member state pursuant
39 to this compact or through the data system, when certified by the compact
40 commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business
41 records of the compact commission and shall be entitled to any associated
42 hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative
43 proceedings in a member state.
HB 2070—Am. by HC 16
1 (e) Current significant investigative information pertaining to a
2 licensee in any member state shall only be available to other member
3 states.
4 (f) Member states shall report any adverse action against a licensee
5 and to monitor the data system to determine whether any adverse action
6 has been taken against a licensee. Adverse action information pertaining to
7 a licensee in any member state shall be available to any other member
8 state.
9 (g) Member states contributing information to the data system may
10 designate information that shall not be shared with the public without the
11 express permission of the contributing state.
12 (h) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently
13 expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the member state
14 contributing the information shall be removed from the data system.
15 SECTION 10—RULEMAKING
16 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in
17 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
18 and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or
19 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid
20 because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
21 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the
22 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
23 review.
24 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law
25 in each member state, except that where the rules conflict with the laws or
26 regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions and
27 processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the
28 circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of
29 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be
30 ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
31 (c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
32 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted
33 thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or
34 as of the date specified in the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
35 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
36 or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
37 manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption
38 of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any
39 member state.
40 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
41 compact commission.
42 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission
43 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written
HB 2070—Am. by HC 17
1 comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments.
2 (g) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the compact commission
3 and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the compact
4 commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact
5 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
6 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly
7 accessible platform;
8 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the compact
9 commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and
10 (3) in such other way as the compact commission may by rule
11 specify.
12 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
13 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the
14 compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and,
15 if different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the compact
16 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
17 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference or
18 other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the
19 mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
20 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
21 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
22 person; and
23 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written
24 comments.
25 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
26 written comments and documents received by the compact commission in
27 response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
28 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
29 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
30 compact commission at hearings required by this section.
31 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
32 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and
33 the full text of the rule.
34 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule
35 if the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
36 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the
37 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
38 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
39 commenters.
40 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective
41 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l),
42 the effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after issuing
43 the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
HB 2070—Am. by HC 18
1 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact
2 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
3 notice, with an opportunity to comment, except that the usual rulemaking
4 procedures provided in the compact and this section shall be retroactively
5 applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but not later than 90 days
6 after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
7 emergency rule is one that shall be adopted immediately in order to:
8 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
9 (2) prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
10 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established
11 by federal law or rule; or
12 (4) protect public health and safety.
13 (m) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the
14 compact commission may direct revision to a previously adopted rule for
15 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
16 consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be
17 posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be
18 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.
19 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results
20 in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
21 delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period.
22 If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further
23 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
24 without the approval of the compact commission.
25 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
26 compact.
27 SECTION 11—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
28 ENFORCEMENT
29 (a) Oversight.
30 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
31 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
32 appropriate to implement this compact.
33 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and
34 judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
35 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where
36 the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact
37 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
38 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
39 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
40 of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
41 misconduct or any such similar matter.
42 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
43 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of
HB 2070—Am. by HC 19
1 the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for
2 all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process
3 shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this
4 compact or promulgated rules.
5 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
6 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has
7 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
8 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
9 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
10 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
11 other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training
12 and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
13 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
14 default to the other member states.
15 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
16 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
17 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
18 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
19 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
20 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
21 default.
22 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
23 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
24 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact
25 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
26 defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority and
27 each of the member states' licensing authority.
28 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
29 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
30 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
31 termination.
32 (f) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact,
33 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
34 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
35 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six
36 months after the date of said notice of termination.
37 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
38 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact,
39 unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the
40 defaulting state.
41 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact
42 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
43 of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its
HB 2070—Am. by HC 20
1 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
2 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
3 (i) Dispute resolution.
4 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall
5 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among
6 member states and among member and nonmember states.
7 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
8 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
9 (j) Enforcement.
10 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal
11 action against a member state in default in the United States district court
12 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
13 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
14 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may
15 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial
16 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
17 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein
18 shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The
19 compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under
20 federal or the defaulting member state's law.
21 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
22 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
23 or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
24 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
25 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
26 damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
27 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
28 attorney fees.
29 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact
30 against the compact commission.
31 SECTION 12—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
32 AMENDMENT
33 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
34 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
35 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact
36 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
37 seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the statute
38 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
39 model compact statute.
40 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
41 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the
42 default process set forth in section 11.
43 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is
HB 2070—Am. by HC 21
1 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall
2 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
3 number of member states should be fewer than seven.
4 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
5 initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
6 section 8(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
7 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation
8 in the compact.
9 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in
10 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
11 the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into
12 existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission
13 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
14 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
15 commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
16 the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes
17 law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact
18 commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the
19 compact becomes law in that state.
20 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
21 statute repealing such compact.
22 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
23 after enactment of the repealing statute.
24 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
25 withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
26 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
27 effective date of withdrawal.
28 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
29 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
30 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
31 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
32 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180
33 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
34 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
35 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
36 between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with
37 the provisions of this compact.
38 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
39 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
40 member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
41 SECTION 13—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
42 (a) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority
43 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
HB 2070—Am. by HC 22
1 implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
2 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall
3 not be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority
4 solely for those purposes.
5 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
6 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
7 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
8 state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the United States,
9 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
10 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
11 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
12 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
13 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
14 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the compact commission may
15 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
16 requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation in
17 the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member
18 state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact shall be
19 held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
20 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
21 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
22 matters.
23 SECTION 14—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
24 OTHER STATE LAWS
25 (a) Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement
26 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
27 compact.
28 (b) Any laws, statutes, rules and regulations or other legal
29 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are
30 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
31 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and
32 the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
33 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
34 publication in the statute book.

41 SECTION 5—OBTAINING A NEW HOME STATE LICENSE BASED
42 ON A COMPACT PRIVILEGE
43

HB 2070—Am. by HC 7
1 (a) A licensee may hold a home state license that allows for a

3 time.
4 (b) If a licensee changes home state by moving between two member
5 states:
6 (1) The licensee shall file an application for obtaining a new home
7 state license based on a compact privilege, pay all applicable fees and
8 notify the current and new home state in accordance with the rules of the
9 compact commission.
10 (2) Upon receipt of an application for obtaining a new home state

17 home state; and
18 (C) any jurisprudence requirements of the new home state.
19 (3) The former home state shall convert the former home state license
20 into a compact privilege once the new home state has activated the new
21 home state license in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the
22 compact commission.
23 (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this compact, if the
24 licensee cannot meet the criteria in section 4, the new home state may

26 (5) The licensee shall pay all applicable fees to the new home state in
27 order to be issued a new home state license.
28 (c) If a licensee changes their state of residence by moving from a
29 member state to a nonmember state, or from a nonmember state to a
30 member state, the state criteria shall apply for issuance of a single state
31 license in the new state.
32 (d) Nothing in this compact shall interfere with a licensee's ability to
33 hold a single state license in multiple states, except that for the purposes of
34 this compact, a licensee shall have only one home state license.
35 (e) Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established
36 by a member state for the issuance of a single state license.
37 SECTION 6—ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS OR THEIR SPOUSES
38 An active military member, or their spouse, shall designate a home
39 state where the individual has a current license in good standing. The
40 individual may retain the home state designation during the period the
41 service member is on active duty.
42 SECTION 7—ADVERSE ACTIONS
43 (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote

HB 2070—Am. by HC 8
1 state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process
2 law, to:
3 (1) Take adverse action against a licensee's compact privilege within
4 that member state; and
5 (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
6 the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of
7 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a member state for
8 the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence
9 from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court
10 of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure
11 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before that court.
12 The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage
13 and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the
14 witnesses or evidence are located.
15 (b) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action
16 against a licensee's home state license.
17 (c) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give
18 the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member
19 state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state. In so
20 doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
21 appropriate action.
22 (d) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a
23 licensee who changes home states during the course of the investigations.
24 The home state shall also have authority to take appropriate action and
25 promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator
26 of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly
27 notify the new home state of any adverse actions.
28 (e) A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover
29 from the affected licensee the costs of investigations and dispositions of
30 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
31 (f) A member state may take adverse action based on the factual
32 findings of another remote state if the member state follows its own
33 procedures for taking the adverse action.
34 (g) Joint investigations.
35 (1) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its
36 respective state law, any member state may participate with other member
37 states in joint investigations of licensees.
38 (2) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation or
39 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint investigation initiated
40 under the compact.
41 (h) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's
42 home state license resulting in an encumbrance on the home state license,
43 the licensee's compact privilege in all other member states shall be revoked

HB 2070—Am. by HC 9
1 until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All
2 home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a
3 licensee shall include a statement that the licensee's compact privileges are
4 revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.
5 (i) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an
6 unencumbered license as certified by the home state's licensing authority,
7 the licensee shall meet the requirements of section 4(a) and follow the
8 administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in
9 any remote state.
10 (j) If a member state takes adverse action, such state shall promptly
11 notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data
12 system shall promptly notify the other member states state of any adverse
13 actions.
14 (k) Nothing in this compact shall override a member state's decision
15 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
16 action.
17 SECTION 8—ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DIETITIAN LICENSURE
18 COMPACT COMMISSION

22 or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The procurement of
23 insurance of any type by the compact commission shall not in any way
24 compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
25 (2) The compact commission shall defend any member, officer,
26 executive director, employee and representative of the compact
27 commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
28 any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope

32 scope of compact commission employment, duties or responsibilities,
33 except that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from

1 commission employment, duties or responsibilities, except that the actual
2 or alleged act, error or omission did not result from the intentional or
3 willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
4 (4) Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a limitation on the
5 liability of any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which
6 shall be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.

10 1890, the Clayton act 15 U.S.C. §§ 12-27 or any other state or federal

15 SECTION 10—RULEMAKING
16 (a) The compact commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in
17 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes
18 and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force or
19 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid
20 because the compact commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
21 manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the
22 powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
23 review.
24 (b) The rules of the compact commission shall have the force of law
25 in each member state, except that where the rules conflict with the laws or
26 regulations of a member state that relate to the procedures, actions and
27 processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the
28 circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of
29 competent jurisdiction, the rules of the compact commission shall be
30 ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
31 (c) The compact commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
32 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted
33 thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or

35 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule
36 or portion of a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
37 manner used to adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption
38 of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any
39 member state.
40 (e) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
41 compact commission.
42 (f) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission
43 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written

4 commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the compact
5 commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
6 (1) On the website of the compact commission or other publicly
7 accessible platform;
8 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the compact
9 commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and
10 (3) in such other way as the compact commission may by rule
11 specify.
12 (h) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
13 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing at which the
14 compact commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and,
15 if different, the time, date and location of the meeting where the compact
16 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
17 (2) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference or
18 other means of communication, the compact commission shall include the
19 mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
20 (3) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
21 (4) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
22 person; and
23 (5) the manner in which interested persons may submit written
24 comments.
25 (i) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
26 written comments and documents received by the compact commission in
27 response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
28 (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
29 hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
30 compact commission at hearings required by this section.
31 (k) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
32 take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and
33 the full text of the rule.
34 (1) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule
35 if the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
36 (2) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the
37 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
38 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
39 commenters.
40 (3) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective
41 date for the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l),
42 the effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after issuing
43 the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.

HB 2070—Am. by HC 18
1 (l) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact
2 commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours'
3 notice, with an opportunity to comment, except that the usual rulemaking
4 procedures provided in the compact and this section shall be retroactively
5 applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but not later than 90 days
6 after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
7 emergency rule is one that shall be adopted immediately in order to:

15 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
16 consistency or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be
17 posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be
18 subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.
19 The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results
20 in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and
21 delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period.
22 If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further
23 action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
24 without the approval of the compact commission.
25 (n) No member state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
26 compact.
27 SECTION 11—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
28 ENFORCEMENT
29 (a) Oversight.
30 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
31 member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and
32 appropriate to implement this compact.
33 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and
34 judicial proceedings by or against the compact commission shall be
35 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where
36 the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact
37 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
38 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
39 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
40 of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
41 misconduct or any such similar matter.
42 (3) The compact commission shall be entitled to receive service of
43 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of

HB 2070—Am. by HC 19
1 the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for
2 all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process
3 shall render a judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this
4 compact or promulgated rules.
5 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
6 (1) If the compact commission determines that a member state has
7 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
8 this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
9 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall
10 describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
11 other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training
12 and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
13 (2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
14 default to the other member states.
15 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
16 may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
17 majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
18 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on
19 the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
20 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
21 default.
22 (d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only
23 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
24 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact
25 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the
26 defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's licensing authority and
27 each of the member states' licensing authority.
28 (e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
29 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
30 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of

33 that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state
34 of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all
35 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six
36 months after the date of said notice of termination.
37 (g) The compact commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
38 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact,
39 unless agreed upon in writing between the compact commission and the
40 defaulting state.
41 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact
42 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
43 of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its

HB 2070—Am. by HC 20
1 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
2 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
3 (i) Dispute resolution.
4 (1) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall
5 attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among
6 member states and among member and nonmember states.
7 (2) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
8 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
9 (j) Enforcement.
10 (1) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal
11 action against a member state in default in the United States district court
12 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact
13 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
14 provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may
15 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event that judicial
16 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
17 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein
18 shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The
19 compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under
20 federal or the defaulting member state's law.
21 (2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact
22 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
23 or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
24 offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
25 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
26 damages. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
27 party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
28 attorney fees.
29 (3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact
30 against the compact commission.
31 SECTION 12—EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL AND
32 AMENDMENT
33 (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date that the compact
34 statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.
35 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact
36 commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first
37 seven member states, "charter member states," to determine if the statute
38 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the
39 model compact statute.
40 (A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be
41 materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the
42 default process set forth in section 11.
43 (B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is

HB 2070—Am. by HC 21
1 terminated or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall
2 remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the
3 number of member states should be fewer than seven.
4 (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
5 initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in
6 section 8(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
7 from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation
8 in the compact.
9 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in
10 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
11 the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into
12 existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission
13 unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.
14 (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact
15 commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to
16 the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that the compact becomes

18 commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the
19 compact becomes law in that state.
20 (b) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
21 statute repealing such compact.
22 (1) A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days
23 after enactment of the repealing statute.

25 withdrawing state's licensing authority to comply with the investigative
26 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
27 effective date of withdrawal.
28 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a
29 state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees
30 within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to
31 the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all
32 compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180
33 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
34 (c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
35 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
36 between a member state and a nonmember state that does not conflict with
37 the provisions of this compact.
38 (d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No
39 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any

43 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the

HB 2070—Am. by HC 22
1 implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
2 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall
3 not be construed to limit the compact commission's rulemaking authority
4 solely for those purposes.
5 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any
6 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
7 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member
8 state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the United States,
9 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
10 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
11 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
12 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
13 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
14 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the compact commission may
15 deny a state's participation in the compact or, in accordance with the
16 requirements of section 11(b), terminate a member state's participation in
17 the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member
18 state is a material departure from the compact. If this compact shall be
19 held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
20 shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and
21 in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable
22 matters.
23 SECTION 14—CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
24 OTHER STATE LAWS

26 of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the
27 compact.
28 (b) Any laws, statutes, rules and regulations or other legal
29 requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are
30 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
31 (c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and
32 the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
33 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
34 publication in the statute book.
