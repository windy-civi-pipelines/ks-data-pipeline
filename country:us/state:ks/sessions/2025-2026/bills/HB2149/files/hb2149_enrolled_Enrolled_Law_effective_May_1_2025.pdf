for the use of the utility's system; and
(2) authorize a utility to charge a distributed energy customer for
power exported to the utility by such customer.
(m) (1) Any customer who has received approval from a utility to
construct or operate a distributed energy system pursuant to this
section shall notify the utility within 30 calendar days following the
date that the construction has been canceled or the system is
permanently shut down. Upon receipt of such notice, the utility shall

Substitute for HOUSE BILL No. 2149—page 10
cancel the parallel generation service contract with such customer.
(2) If a utility has reason to suspect that a customer's distributed
energy system has been abandoned and is no longer producing energy,
such utility may request verification from the customer that the system
is still functioning, or that the customer has a reasonable plan to
reenergize the system. If the customer fails to repair the system or
provide a reasonable plan to complete such repairs within six months,
the utility shall have the option to cancel the parallel generation
service contract with such customer.
(3) Upon cancellation of any parallel generation service contract
pursuant to this subsection, the utility shall not be obligated to refund
any fees previously paid by the customer.
(n) (1) A customer shall have the right to repair or rebuild such
customer's distributed energy system with listed equipment as long as
such repair or rebuilding does not cause an increase in export
capacity.
(2) If a customer repairs or replaces a distributed energy system,
the customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or replacement
and provide proof that the new equipment complies with the same
rules, regulations and approved capacity as the original installation.
The utility shall have the right to require and conduct a witness test
prior to authorizing operation of the system. A customer who repairs or
replaces a system pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to
submit a new parallel generation service application to the utility.
(3) A customer shall not repair or replace a distributed energy
system in a way that increases the export capacity of the system without
providing prior notification to the utility. The utility may require the
customer to submit a new parallel generation service application to
include the new provisions and requirements relating to such system.
(f)(o) (1) The governing body of any school desiring to proceed
under this section shall, prior to taking any action permitted by this
section, make a finding that either:
(1)(A) Net energy cost savings will accrue to the school from such
renewable generation over a 20-year period; or
(2)(B) that such renewable generation is a science project being
conducted for educational purposes and that such project may not
recoup the expenses of the project through energy cost savings.
(2) Any school proceeding under this section may contract or
enter into a finance, pledge, loan or lease-purchase agreement with the
Kansas development finance authority as a means of financing the cost
of such renewable generation.
(g)(p) Each kilowatt of nameplate capacity of the parallel
generation of electricity provided for in this section shall count as 1.10
kilowatts toward the compliance of the affected utility, as defined in
K.S.A. 66-1257, and amendments thereto, and with whom the
customer-generator has contracted, with the renewable energy
standards act in K.S.A. 66-1256 through 66-1262, and amendments
theretoNothing in this section shall be construed to require any
cooperative as defined in K.S.A. 17-4603, and amendments thereto,
electric utility owned by one or more such cooperatives, nonstock
member-owned electric cooperative corporation incorporated in this
state or municipally owned or operated electric utility to opt in to or
otherwise participate in any demand response or distributed energy
resource aggregation programs.
(h)(q) The provisions of the net metering and easy connection act
shall not preclude the state corporation commission from approving net
metering tariffs upon request of an electric utility for other methods of
renewable generation not prescribed in subsection (b)(1) of K.S.A. 66-
1264(b)(1), and amendments thereto.
Sec. 5. K.S.A. 66-1268 is hereby amended to read as follows: 66-
1268. (a) Net metered facilities must meet all applicable safety,
performance, interconnection and reliability standards established by
the national electrical code, the national electrical safety code, the
institute of electrical and electronics engineers, underwriters

Substitute for HOUSE BILL No. 2149—page 11
laboratories, the federal energy regulatory commission and any local
governing authorities. A utility may require that a customer-generator's
system contain a switch, circuit breaker, fuse or other easily accessible
device or feature located in immediate proximity to the customer-
generator's metering equipment that would allow a utility worker the
ability to manually and instantly disconnect the unit from the utility's
electric distribution system.
(b) A utility may not require a customer-generator whose net
metering facility meets the standards in subsection (a) to comply with
additional safety or performance standards or perform or pay for
additional tests or purchase additional liability insurance. A utility shall
not be liable directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow
an attachment of a net metered facility or for the acts or omissions of
the customer-generator that cause loss or injury, including death, to any
third party.
(c) (1) Any customer-generator who has received approval from a
utility to construct or operate a net metering facility shall notify the
utility within 30 calendar days following the date that the construction
has been canceled or the facility is permanently shut down. Upon
receipt of such notice, the utility shall cancel the interconnection
agreement with such customer.
(2) If a utility has reason to suspect that a customer-generator's
facility has been abandoned and is no longer producing energy, such
utility may request verification from the customer-generator that the
facility is still functioning or that the customer-generator has a
reasonable plan to reenergize the facility. If the customer-generator
fails to repair the facility or provide a reasonable plan to complete
such repairs within six months, the utility shall have the option to
cancel the interconnection agreement with such customer-generator.
(3) Upon cancellation of any interconnection agreement pursuant
to this subsection, the utility shall not be obligated to refund any fees
previously paid by the customer-generator.
(d) (1) A customer-generator shall have the right to repair or
rebuild such customer-generator's net metering facility that is subject
to an interconnection agreement with listed equipment as long as such
repair or rebuilding does not cause an increase in export capacity.
(2) If a customer-generator repairs or replaces a facility, the
customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or replacement and
provide proof that the new equipment complies with the same rules,
regulations and approved capacity as the original installation. The
utility shall have the right to require and conduct a witness test prior to
authorizing operation of the facility. A customer who repairs or
replaces a facility pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to
submit a new net metering interconnection application to the utility.
(3) A customer-generator shall not repair or replace a facility
system in a way that increases the export capacity of the system without
providing prior notification to the utility. The utility may require the
customer-generator to submit a new net metering interconnection
application to include the new provisions and requirements relating to
such facility.
