7 canceled or the facility is permanently shut down. Upon receipt of such
8 notice, the utility shall cancel the interconnection agreement with such
9 customer.
10 (2) If a utility has reason to suspect that a customer-generator's
11 facility has been abandoned and is no longer producing energy, such
12 utility may request verification from the customer-generator that the
13 facility is still functioning or that the customer-generator has a reasonable
14 plan to reenergize the facility. If the customer-generator fails to repair the
15 facility or provide a reasonable plan to complete such repairs within six
16 months, the utility shall have the option to cancel the interconnection
17 agreement with such customer-generator.

19 this subsection, the utility shall not be obligated to refund any fees
20 previously paid by the customer-generator.
21 (d) (1) A customer-generator shall have the right to repair or rebuild
22 such customer-generator's net metering facility that is subject to an
23 interconnection agreement with listed equipment as long as such repair or
24 rebuilding does not cause an increase in export capacity.
25 (2) If a customer-generator repairs or replaces a facility, the
26 customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or replacement and
27 provide proof that the new equipment complies with the same rules,
28 regulations and approved capacity as the original installation. The utility
29 shall have the right to require and conduct a witness test prior to
30 authorizing operation of the facility. A customer who repairs or replaces a
31 facility pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to submit a new
32 net metering interconnection application to the utility.
33 (3) A customer-generator shall not repair or replace a facility system
34 in a way that increases the export capacity of the system without providing
35 prior notification to the utility. The utility may require the customer-
36 generator to submit a new net metering interconnection application to
37 include the new provisions and requirements relating to such facility.
38 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 66-1,184 and 66-1268 are hereby repealed.
39 Sec. 7. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
40 publication in the Kansas register.
