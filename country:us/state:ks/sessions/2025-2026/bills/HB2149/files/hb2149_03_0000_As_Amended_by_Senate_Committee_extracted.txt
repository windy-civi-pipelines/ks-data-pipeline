17 of electricity provided for in this section shall count as 1.10 kilowatts
18 toward the compliance of the affected utility, as defined in K.S.A. 66-
19 1257, and amendments thereto, and with whom the customer-generator has
20 contracted, with the renewable energy standards act in K.S.A. 66-1256
21 through 66-1262, and amendments theretoNothing in this section shall be
22 construed to require any cooperative as defined in K.S.A. 17-4603, and
23 amendments thereto, electric utility owned by one or more such
24 cooperatives, nonstock member-owned electric cooperative corporation
25 incorporated in this state or municipally owned or operated electric utility
26 to opt in to or otherwise participate in any demand response or distributed
27 energy resource aggregation programs.
28 (h)(q) The provisions of the net metering and easy connection act
29 shall not preclude the state corporation commission from approving net
30 metering tariffs upon request of an electric utility for other methods of
31 renewable generation not prescribed in subsection (b)(1) of K.S.A. 66-
32 1264(b)(1), and amendments thereto.
33 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 66-1268 is hereby amended to read as follows: 66-
34 1268. (a) Net metered facilities must meet all applicable safety,
35 performance, interconnection and reliability standards established by the
36 national electrical code, the national electrical safety code, the institute of
37 electrical and electronics engineers, underwriters laboratories, the federal
38 energy regulatory commission and any local governing authorities. A
39 utility may require that a customer-generator's system contain a switch,
40 circuit breaker, fuse or other easily accessible device or feature located in
41 immediate proximity to the customer-generator's metering equipment that
42 would allow a utility worker the ability to manually and instantly
43 disconnect the unit from the utility's electric distribution system.

HB 2149—Am. by SC 16
1 (b) A utility may not require a customer-generator whose net
2 metering facility meets the standards in subsection (a) to comply with
3 additional safety or performance standards or perform or pay for additional
4 tests or purchase additional liability insurance. A utility shall not be liable
5 directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow an attachment of
6 a net metered facility or for the acts or omissions of the customer-
7 generator that cause loss or injury, including death, to any third party.
8 (c) (1) Any customer-generator who has received approval from a
9 utility to construct or operate a net metering facility shall notify the utility
10 within 30 calendar days following the date that the construction has been
11 canceled or the facility is permanently shut down. Upon receipt of such
12 notice, the utility shall cancel the interconnection agreement with such
13 customer.
14 (2) If a utility has reason to suspect that a customer-generator's
15 facility has been abandoned and is no longer producing energy, such
16 utility may request verification from the customer-generator that the
17 facility is still functioning or that the customer-generator has a reasonable
18 plan to reenergize the facility. If the customer-generator fails to repair the
19 facility or provide a reasonable plan to complete such repairs within six
20 months, the utility shall have the option to cancel the interconnection
21 agreement with such customer-generator.
22 (3) Upon cancellation of any interconnection agreement pursuant to
23 this subsection, the utility shall not be obligated to refund any fees
24 previously paid by the customer-generator.
25 (d) (1) A customer-generator shall have the right to repair or rebuild
26 such customer-generator's net metering facility that is subject to an
27 interconnection agreement with listed equipment as long as such repair or
28 rebuilding does not cause an increase in export capacity.
29 (2) If a customer-generator repairs or replaces a facility, the
30 customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or replacement and
31 provide proof that the new equipment complies with the same rules,
32 regulations and approved capacity as the original installation. The utility
33 shall have the right to require and conduct a witness test prior to
34 authorizing operation of the facility. A customer who repairs or replaces a
35 facility pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to submit a new
36 net metering interconnection application to the utility.
37 (3) A customer-generator shall not repair or replace a facility system
38 in a way that increases the export capacity of the system without providing
39 prior notification to the utility. The utility may require the customer-
40 generator to submit a new net metering interconnection application to
41 include the new provisions and requirements relating to such facility.
42 Sec. 6. K.S.A. 66-1,184 and 66-1268 are hereby repealed.
43 Sec. 7. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
