1 with such customer.
2 (3) Upon cancellation of any parallel generation service contract
3 pursuant to this subsection, the utility shall:
4 (A) Make the associated export capacity available to other customers
5 of the utility; and
6 (B) not be obligated to refund any fees previously paid by the
7 customer.
8 (o) (1) A customer shall have the right to repair or rebuild such
9 customer's renewable energy system subject to a parallel generation
10 service contract if the repair does not materially affect the portion of the
11 system that interacts with the utility or cause an increase in export
12 capacity.
13 (2) If a customer will repair or replace a system in a way that
14 materially affects the portion of the system that interacts with the utility,
15 the customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or replacement
16 and provide proof that the new equipment complies with the same rules,
17 regulations and approved capacity as the original installation. A customer
18 who repairs or replaces a system pursuant to this paragraph shall not be
19 required to submit a new parallel generation service application to the
20 utility.
21 (3) If a customer will repair or replace a system in a way that

23 utility prior to such repair or replacement. The utility may require the
24 customer to submit a new parallel generation service application to
25 include the new provisions and requirements relating to such system.
26 (f)(p) (1) The governing body of any school desiring to proceed under
27 this section shall, prior to taking any action permitted by this section, make
28 a finding that either:
29 (1)(A) Net energy cost savings will accrue to the school from such
30 renewable generation over a 20-year period; or
31 (2)(B) that such renewable generation is a science project being
32 conducted for educational purposes and that such project may not recoup
33 the expenses of the project through energy cost savings.
34 (2) Any school proceeding under this section may contract or enter
35 into a finance, pledge, loan or lease-purchase agreement with the Kansas
36 development finance authority as a means of financing the cost of such

21 tests or purchase additional liability insurance. A utility shall not be liable
22 directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow an attachment of
23 a net metered facility or for the acts or omissions of the customer-
24 generator that cause loss or injury, including death, to any third party.
25 (c) (1) Any customer-generator who has received approval from a
26 utility to construct or operate a net metering facility shall notify the utility
27 when the construction has been canceled or the facility is permanently
28 shut down. Upon receipt of such notice, the utility shall cancel the
29 interconnection agreement with such customer.
30 (2) If a utility has reason to suspect that a customer-generator's
31 facility has been abandoned and is no longer producing energy, such
32 utility may request verification from the customer-generator that the
33 facility is still functioning or that the customer-generator has a reasonable
34 plan to reenergize the facility. If the customer-generator fails to repair the
35 facility or provide a reasonable plan to complete such repairs within 24
36 months, the utility shall have the option to cancel the interconnection
37 agreement with such customer-generator.
38 (3) Upon cancellation of any interconnection agreement pursuant to
39 this subsection, the utility shall:
40 (A) Make the associated export capacity available to other customer-
41 generators of the utility; and
42 (B) not be obligated to refund any fees previously paid by the
43 customer-generator.
HB 2149 14
1 (d) (1) A customer-generator shall have the right to repair or rebuild
2 such customer-generator's net metering facility that is subject to an
3 interconnection agreement if the repair does not materially affect the
4 portion of the facility that interacts with the utility or cause an increase in
5 export capacity.
6 (2) If a customer-generator will repair or replace a facility in a way
7 that materially affects the portion of the facility that interacts with the
8 utility, the customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or
9 replacement and provide proof that the new equipment complies with the
10 same rules, regulations and approved capacity as the original installation.
11 A customer who repairs or replaces a facility pursuant to this paragraph
12 shall not be required to submit a new net metering interconnection
13 application to the utility.
14 (3) If a customer-generator will repair or replace a facility in a way
15 that increases the export capacity, the customer-generator shall notify the
16 utility prior to such repair or replacement. The utility may require the
17 customer-generator to submit a new net metering interconnection
18 application to include the new provisions and requirements relating to
19 such facility.
20 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 66-1,184 and 66-1268 are hereby repealed.
21 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
22 publication in the statute book.

1 contribute to the customer's export capacity shall not be considered when
2 determining the appropriate system size.
3 (i) A utility shall not be required to approve a customer's request for
4 parallel generation service if such service would cause the utility's
5 aggregate export capacity from all renewable energy systems subject to
6 parallel generation service to exceed 10% of such utility's historic peak
7 demand. The utility may limit the number and size export capacity of
8 additional renewable generators energy systems to be connected to the
9 utility's system due to the capacity of the distribution line to which such
10 renewable generator would energy system will be connected, and in no
11 case shall the utility be obligated to purchase an amount greater than 4% of
12 such utility's peak power requirements.
13 (j) (1) A utility may require any customer who is seeking to construct
14 and install a renewable energy system that limits the export to the utility's
15 system in an amount that differs from the system's nameplate capacity to
16 submit an application prior to any connection of the renewable energy
17 system with the utility's system, notify the utility of the proposed renewable
18 energy system and verify that such system is installed and connected in
19 accordance with all applicable standards and codes. A utility may assess
20 upon any such customer a nonrefundable application fee in an amount not
21 to exceed the applicable nonrefundable interconnection application fee
22 established pursuant to subsection (c). The amount of the nonrefundable

7 customer.
8 (o) (1) A customer shall have the right to repair or rebuild such
9 customer's renewable energy system subject to a parallel generation
10 service contract if the repair does not materially affect the portion of the
11 system that interacts with the utility or cause an increase in export
12 capacity.
13 (2) If a customer will repair or replace a system in a way that
14 materially affects the portion of the system that interacts with the utility,
15 the customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or replacement
16 and provide proof that the new equipment complies with the same rules,
17 regulations and approved capacity as the original installation. A customer
18 who repairs or replaces a system pursuant to this paragraph shall not be
19 required to submit a new parallel generation service application to the
20 utility.
21 (3) If a customer will repair or replace a system in a way that
22 increases the export capacity of the system, the customer shall notify the
23 utility prior to such repair or replacement. The utility may require the
24 customer to submit a new parallel generation service application to
25 include the new provisions and requirements relating to such system.
26 (f)(p) (1) The governing body of any school desiring to proceed under
27 this section shall, prior to taking any action permitted by this section, make
28 a finding that either:
29 (1)(A) Net energy cost savings will accrue to the school from such
30 renewable generation over a 20-year period; or
31 (2)(B) that such renewable generation is a science project being
32 conducted for educational purposes and that such project may not recoup
33 the expenses of the project through energy cost savings.
34 (2) Any school proceeding under this section may contract or enter
35 into a finance, pledge, loan or lease-purchase agreement with the Kansas
36 development finance authority as a means of financing the cost of such
37 renewable generation.
38 (g)(q) Each kilowatt of nameplate export capacity of the associated
39 with a utility's parallel generation of electricity provided for in this section
40 service shall count as 1.10 kilowatts toward the compliance of the an
41 affected utility, as defined in K.S.A. 66-1257, and amendments thereto,
42 and with whom the customer-generator has contracted, with the renewable
43 energy standards act in K.S.A. 66-1256 through 66-1262, and amendments

HB 2149 13
1 thereto.
2 (h)(r) The provisions of the net metering and easy connection act

13 utility may require that a customer-generator's system contain a switch,
14 circuit breaker, fuse or other easily accessible device or feature located in
15 immediate proximity to the customer-generator's metering equipment that
16 would allow a utility worker the ability to manually and instantly
17 disconnect the unit from the utility's electric distribution system.
18 (b) A utility may not require a customer-generator whose net
19 metering facility meets the standards in subsection (a) to comply with
20 additional safety or performance standards or perform or pay for additional
21 tests or purchase additional liability insurance. A utility shall not be liable
22 directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow an attachment of
23 a net metered facility or for the acts or omissions of the customer-
24 generator that cause loss or injury, including death, to any third party.
25 (c) (1) Any customer-generator who has received approval from a
26 utility to construct or operate a net metering facility shall notify the utility
27 when the construction has been canceled or the facility is permanently
28 shut down. Upon receipt of such notice, the utility shall cancel the
29 interconnection agreement with such customer.
30 (2) If a utility has reason to suspect that a customer-generator's
31 facility has been abandoned and is no longer producing energy, such
32 utility may request verification from the customer-generator that the
33 facility is still functioning or that the customer-generator has a reasonable
34 plan to reenergize the facility. If the customer-generator fails to repair the
35 facility or provide a reasonable plan to complete such repairs within 24
36 months, the utility shall have the option to cancel the interconnection
37 agreement with such customer-generator.
38 (3) Upon cancellation of any interconnection agreement pursuant to
39 this subsection, the utility shall:
40 (A) Make the associated export capacity available to other customer-
41 generators of the utility; and
42 (B) not be obligated to refund any fees previously paid by the
43 customer-generator.

HB 2149 14
1 (d) (1) A customer-generator shall have the right to repair or rebuild
2 such customer-generator's net metering facility that is subject to an
3 interconnection agreement if the repair does not materially affect the
4 portion of the facility that interacts with the utility or cause an increase in
5 export capacity.
6 (2) If a customer-generator will repair or replace a facility in a way
7 that materially affects the portion of the facility that interacts with the
8 utility, the customer shall notify the utility prior to such repair or
9 replacement and provide proof that the new equipment complies with the
10 same rules, regulations and approved capacity as the original installation.
11 A customer who repairs or replaces a facility pursuant to this paragraph
12 shall not be required to submit a new net metering interconnection
13 application to the utility.
14 (3) If a customer-generator will repair or replace a facility in a way
15 that increases the export capacity, the customer-generator shall notify the
16 utility prior to such repair or replacement. The utility may require the
17 customer-generator to submit a new net metering interconnection
18 application to include the new provisions and requirements relating to
19 such facility.
20 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 66-1,184 and 66-1268 are hereby repealed.
21 Sec. 5. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
22 publication in the statute book.
