31 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
32 New Section 1. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), without
33 limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be documented or
34 the manner in which a document may be signed or delivered:
35 (A) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the Kansas
HB 2371—Am. by HC 2
1 revised limited liability company act or the operating agreement may be
2 provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission is the
3 equivalent of a written document.
4 (B) Whenever the Kansas revised limited liability company act or the
5 operating agreement requires or permits a signature, the signature may be
6 a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. "Electronic
7 signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or
8 logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person
9 with an intent to execute, authenticate or adopt the document. A person
10 may execute a document with such person's signature.
11 (C) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or agreed
12 between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is delivered to
13 a person for purposes of the Kansas revised limited liability company act
14 and the operating agreement when it enters an information processing
15 system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving
16 electronic transmissions of the type delivered if the electronic transmission
17 is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is
18 able to retrieve the electronic transmission. Whether a person has so
19 designated an information processing system is determined by the
20 operating agreement or from the context and surrounding circumstances,
21 including the parties' conduct. An electronic transmission is delivered
22 under this section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an
23 electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system
24 establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does
25 not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
26 (2) The Kansas revised limited liability company act shall not
27 prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance
28 with the uniform electronic transactions act, K.S.A. 16-601 et seq., and
29 amendments thereto, if the part or parts of the transaction that are
30 governed by the Kansas revised limited liability company act are
31 documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this subsection or
32 otherwise in accordance with the Kansas revised limited liability company
33 act. This subsection shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether
34 an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been
35 signed and delivered, in accordance with the Kansas revised limited
36 liability company act and the operating agreement.
37 (b) (1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to:
38 (A) A document filed with or submitted to the secretary of state or a
39 court or other judicial or governmental body of this state;
40 (B) a certificate of limited liability company interest, except that a
41 signature on a certificate of limited liability company interest may be
42 manual, facsimile or electronic signature; and
43 (C) an act or transaction effected pursuant to article 79 of chapter 17
HB 2371—Am. by HC 3
1 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A. 17-
2 7667, 17-76,130, 17-76,131, 17-76,132 and 17-76,133, and amendments
3 thereto.
4 (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not create any presumption
5 about the lawful means to document a matter addressed by this subsection
6 or the lawful means to sign or deliver a document addressed by this
7 subsection. A provision of the operating agreement shall not limit the
8 application of subsection (a) unless the provision expressly restricts one or
9 more of the means of documenting an act or transaction, or of signing or
10 delivering a document, permitted by subsection (a).
11 (c) In the event that any provision of the Kansas revised limited
12 liability company act is deemed to modify, limit or supersede the federal
13 electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. §
14 7001 et. seq., the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
15 company act shall control to the fullest extent permitted by 15 U.S.C. §
16 7002(a)(2).
17 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
18 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
19 New Sec. 2. (a) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a
20 subscription for a limited liability company interest, whether submitted in
21 writing, by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
22 applicable law, is irrevocable if the subscription states that such
23 subscription is irrevocable to the extent provided by the terms of the
24 subscription.
25 (b) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
26 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.

30 transaction that may be taken by or in respect of a limited liability
31 company under the Kansas revised limited liability company act or an
32 operating agreement, but that is void or voidable when taken, may be
33 ratified, or the failure to comply with any requirements of the operating
34 agreement making such act or transaction void or voidable may be
35 waived, by the members, managers or other persons whose approval
36 would be required under the operating agreement (i) for such act or
37 transaction to be validly taken, or (ii) to amend the operating agreement
38 in a manner that would permit such act or transaction to be validly taken,
39 in each case at the time of such ratification or waiver.
40 (B) If the void or voidable act or transaction was the issuance or
41 assignment of any limited liability company interests, the limited liability
42 company interests purportedly issued or assigned shall be deemed not to
43 have been issued or assigned for purposes of determining whether the void
HB 2371—Am. by HC 9
1 or voidable act or transaction was ratified or waived pursuant to this
2 subsection.
3 (2) Any act or transaction that is ratified, or with respect to which the
4 failure to comply with any requirements of the operating agreement is
5 waived, pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed validly taken at the
6 time of such act or transaction.
7 (3) If an amendment to the operating agreement to permit any such
8 act or transaction to be validly taken would require notice to any
9 members, managers or other persons under the operating agreement and
10 the ratification or waiver of such act or transaction is effectuated pursuant
11 to this subsection by the members, managers or other persons whose
12 approval would be required to amend the operating agreement, notice of
13 such ratification or waiver shall be given following such ratification or
14 waiver to the members, managers or other persons who would have been
15 entitled to notice of such an amendment and who have not otherwise
16 received notice of, or participated in, such ratification or waiver.
17 (4) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit
18 the accomplishment of a ratification or waiver of a void or voidable act by
19 other means permitted by law.
20 (5) Upon application of the limited liability company, any member,
21 manager or person claiming to be substantially and adversely affected by
22 a ratification or waiver pursuant to this subsection, excluding any harm
23 that would have resulted if such act or transaction had been valid when
24 taken, the district court may hear and determine the validity and
25 effectiveness of the ratification of, or waiver with respect to, any void or
26 voidable act or transaction effectuated pursuant to this subsection. In any
27 such application, the limited liability company shall be named as a party
28 and service of the application upon the resident agent of the limited
29 liability company shall be deemed to be service upon the limited liability
30 company, and no other party need be joined in order for the court to
31 adjudicate the validity and effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The
32 court may make such order respecting further or other notice of such
33 application as it deems proper under these circumstances. Nothing in this
34 paragraph limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner
35 now or hereafter provided by law, and this provision is an extension of and
36 not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal
37 process upon nonresidents.

43 (b) (1) Except as provided in the operating agreement, to the extent

3 as a plaintiff in an action to determine that the plaintiff is a member of a
4 limited liability company or in defense of any threatened, pending or
5 completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
6 administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or
7 was a member, manager, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability
8 company, or is or was serving at the request of the limited liability
9 company as a member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of
10 another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture,
11 trust or other enterprise, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
12 such member, manager, officer, employee or agent shall be indemnified by
13 the limited liability company against expenses actually and reasonably
14 incurred by such person in connection therewith, including attorney fees.

4 members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by
5 members who own more than 50% of the then current percentage or other

14 lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights
15 or securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102,
16 and amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting limited
17 liability company in the merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding,
18 or may be canceled.

22 of merger or consolidation.
23 (b) The limited liability company surviving or resulting in or from the
24 merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation
25 executed by one or more authorized persons on behalf of the domestic
26 limited liability company when it is the surviving or resulting entity with

1 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
2 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
3 agreement, in either case, in connection with a merger or consolidation.
4 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the
5 accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by
6 any other means provided for in an operating agreement or other
7 agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the operating
8 agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or
9 consolidation, including a limited liability company formed for the
10 purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the operating
11 agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company.
12 (e) When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective
13 under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of
14 the rights, privileges and powers of each of the limited liability companies

16 mixed, and all debts due to any of the limited liability companies, as well
17 as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such limited
18 liability companies, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting limited
19 liability company, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or
20 resulting limited liability company as they were of each of the limited
21 liability companies that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any
22 real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state of
23 Kansas, in any of such limited liability companies, shall not revert or be in
24 any way impaired by reason of this act, but all rights of creditors and all
25 liens upon any property of any of the limited liability companies shall be
26 preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the
27 limited liability companies that have merged or consolidated shall
28 thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting limited liability company,
29 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities
30 and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed,
31 a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company,
32 including a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
33 surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not
34 require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs
35 under K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and
36 distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and
37 the merger or consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such

4 validity or enforceability of any obligations or liabilities of the dividing
5 company incurred prior to such division;, except that such the obligations

36 shall not constitute a dissolution of such limited liability company.

10 in its capacity as a domestic limited liability company.
11 (5) In the event that any allocation of assets, debts, liabilities and
12 duties to division companies in accordance with a plan of division is

25 company or as otherwise provided in the operating agreement.
26 (b) After the formation of a limited liability company, a person is
27 admitted as a member of the limited liability company:
28 (1) In the case of a person who is not an assignee of a limited liability
29 company interest, including a person acquiring a limited liability company
30 interest directly from the limited liability company and a person to be
31 admitted as a member of the limited liability company without acquiring a
32 limited liability company interest in the limited liability company at the

41 operating agreement or, if the operating agreement does not so provide,
42 when any such person's permitted admission is reflected in the records of
43 the limited liability company; or
HB 2371—Am. by HC 22

6 upon compliance with the operating agreement of the surviving or
7 resulting limited liability company; and in the case of a person being
8 admitted as a member of a limited liability company pursuant to a merger

18 and in the case of a person being admitted as a member of a limited
19 liability company pursuant to a division in which such limited liability
20 company is not a division company in the division, as provided in the
21 operating agreement of such limited liability company.

26 liability company. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
27 person may be admitted to a limited liability company as a member of the
28 limited liability company without acquiring a limited liability company
29 interest in the limited liability company. Unless otherwise provided in an
30 operating agreement, a person may be admitted as the sole member of a
31 limited liability company without making a contribution or being obligated
32 to make a contribution to the limited liability company or without
33 acquiring a limited liability company interest in the limited liability

35 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement or another
36 agreement, a member shall have no preemptive right to subscribe to any
37 additional issue of limited liability company interests or another interest in
38 a limited liability company.
39 Sec. 11. K.S.A. 17-7687 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
40 7687. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
41 members having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
42 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
43 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
HB 2371—Am. by HC 23
1 groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
2 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
3 senior to existing classes and groups of members. An operating agreement
4 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
5 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any member
6 or class or group of members, including an action to create under the
7 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability
8 company interests that was not previously outstanding. An operating
9 agreement may provide that any member or class or group of members
10 shall have no voting rights.
11 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
12 members or a specified class or group of the members the right to vote
13 separately or with all or any class or group of the members or managers,
14 on any matter. Voting by members may be on a per capita, number,
15 financial interest, class, group or any other basis.
16 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
17 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
18 voted on by any members, waiver of any such notice, action by consent or
19 approval without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum
20 requirements, voting in person or by proxy, or any other matter with
21 respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.
22 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
23 members may be held by means of conference telephone or other
24 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
25 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
26 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
27 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
28 voted on, consented to or approved by members, the members may take
29 such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if
30 consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or by any
31 other means permitted by law, by members having not less than the
32 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
33 such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon
34 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
35 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a member, consents to or
36 approves as a member any matter and provides that such consent or
37 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
38 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
39 consented or approved as a member at such future time so long as such
40 person is then a member. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
41 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by members, the members
42 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
43 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
HB 2371—Am. by HC 24
1 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
2 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a member or
3 by a person or persons authorized to act for a member shall be deemed to
4 be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of this
5 subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
6 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
7 including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks
8 or databases, including one or more distributed electronic networks or
9 databases, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and
10 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
11 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
12 (e) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or in the
13 Kansas revised limited liability company act, every member holding an
14 interest in profits shall be entitled to vote.
15 (f) If an operating agreement provides for the manner in which it may
16 be amended, including by requiring the approval or consent of a person
17 who is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction of
18 conditions, it may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise
19 permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
20 amendments thereto, provided that the approval or consent of any person
21 may be waived by such person and that any such conditions may be
22 waived by all persons for whose benefit such conditions were intended.
23 Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a supermajority
24 amendment provision shall only apply to provisions of the operating
25 agreement that are expressly included in the operating agreement. As used
26 in this section, "supermajority amendment provision" means any
27 amendment provision set forth in an operating agreement requiring that an
28 amendment to a provision of the operating agreement be adopted by no
29 less than the vote or consent or approval required to take action under such
30 latter provision.
31 (g) If an operating agreement does not provide for the manner in
32 which it may be amended, the operating agreement may be amended with
33 the approval or consent of all of the members or as otherwise permitted by
34 law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and amendments
35 thereto. This subsection shall only apply to a limited liability company
36 whose original articles of organization were filed with the secretary of
37 state on or after July 1, 2014.
38 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 17-7690 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
39 7690. (a) Each member of a limited liability company, in person or by
40 attorney or other agent, has the right, subject to such reasonable standards,
41 including standards governing what information, including books, records
42 and other documents are, is to be furnished at what time and location and
43 at whose expense, as may be set forth in an operating agreement or
HB 2371—Am. by HC 25
1 otherwise established by the manager or, if there is no manager, then by
2 the members, to obtain from the limited liability company from time to
3 time upon reasonable demand for any purpose reasonably related to the
4 member's interest as a member of the limited liability company:
5 (1) True and full information regarding the status of the business and
6 financial condition of the limited liability company;
7 (2) promptly after becoming available, a copy of the limited liability
8 company's federal, state and local income tax returns for each year;
9 (3) a current list of the name and last known business, residence or
10 mailing address of each member and manager;
11 (4) a copy of any written operating agreement and articles of
12 organization and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of
13 any written powers of attorney pursuant to which the operating agreement
14 and any certificate and all amendments thereto have been executed;
15 (5) true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
16 description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or
17 services contributed by each member and which each member has agreed
18 to contribute in the future, and the date on which each became a member;
19 and
20 (6) other information regarding the affairs of the limited liability
21 company as is just and reasonable.
22 (b) Each manager shall have the right to examine all of the
23 information described in subsection (a) for a purpose reasonably related to
24 the position of manager.
25 (c) The manager of a limited liability company shall have the right to
26 keep confidential from the members, for such period of time as the
27 manager deems reasonable, any information which that the manager
28 reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information
29 the disclosure of which the manager in good faith believes is not in the
30 best interest of the limited liability company or could damage the limited
31 liability company or its business or which the limited liability company is
32 required by law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
33 (d) A limited liability company may maintain its books, records and
34 other documents in other than a written paper form, including on, by
35 means of, or in the form of any information storage device, method, or one
36 or more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
37 distributed electronic networks or databases, if such form is capable of
38 conversion into written paper form within a reasonable time.
39 (e) Any demand under this section shall be in writing and shall state
40 the purpose of such demand. In every instance where an attorney or other
41 agent is the person who seeks the right to obtain the information described
42 in subsection (a), the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
43 or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act
HB 2371—Am. by HC 26
1 on behalf of the member.
2 (f) Any action to enforce any right arising under this section shall be
3 brought in the district court. If the limited liability company refuses to
4 permit a member, or attorney or other agent acting for the member, to
5 obtain or a manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)
6 or does not reply to the demand that has been made within five business
7 days, or such shorter or longer period of time as is provided for in an
8 operating agreement, but not longer than 30 business days, after the
9 demand has been made, the demanding member or manager may apply to
10 the district court for an order to compel such disclosure. The district court
11 may summarily order the limited liability company to permit the
12 demanding member to obtain or manager to examine the information
13 described in subsection (a) and to make copies or abstracts therefrom, or
14 the district court may summarily order the limited liability company to
15 furnish to the demanding member or manager the information described in
16 subsection (a) on the condition that the demanding member or manager
17 first pay to the limited liability company the reasonable cost of obtaining
18 and furnishing such information and on such other conditions as the
19 district court deems appropriate. When a demanding member seeks to
20 obtain or a manager seeks to examine the information described in
21 subsection (a), the demanding member or manager shall first establish: (1)
22 That the demanding member or manager has complied with the provisions
23 of this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for
24 obtaining or examining of such information; and (2) that the information
25 the demanding member or manager seeks is reasonably related to the
26 member's interest as a member or the manager's position as a manager, as
27 the case may be. The district court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
28 limitations or conditions with reference to the obtaining or examining of
29 information, or award such other or further relief as the district court may
30 deem just and proper. The district court may order books, documents and
31 records and other documents, pertinent extracts therefrom, or duly
32 authenticated copies thereof, to be brought within the state of Kansas and
33 kept in the state of Kansas upon such terms and conditions as the order
34 may prescribe.
35 (g) If a member is entitled to obtain information under the Kansas
36 revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement for a
37 purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member or other
38 stated purpose, the member's right shall be to obtain such information as
39 is necessary and essential to achieving that purpose. The rights of a
40 member or manager to obtain or examine information as provided in this
41 section may be expanded or restricted in an original operating agreement
42 or in any subsequent amendment consented to, approved or adopted by all
43 of the members or in compliance with any applicable requirements of the
HB 2371—Am. by HC 27
1 operating agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
2 construed to limit the ability to impose restrictions on expand or restrict
3 the rights of a member or manager to obtain or examine information by
4 any other means permitted under the Kansas revised limited liability
5 company act by law.
6 (h) A limited liability company shall maintain a current record that
7 identifies the name and last known business, residence, or mailing address
8 of each member and manager.
9 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 17-7695 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
10 7695. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
11 managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
12 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
13 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
14 groups of managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
15 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
16 senior to existing classes and groups of managers. An operating agreement
17 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
18 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any manager
19 or class or group of managers, including an action to create under the
20 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability
21 company interests that was not previously outstanding.
22 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
23 managers or a specified class or group of the managers the right to vote,
24 separately or with all or any class or group of managers or members, on
25 any matter. Voting by managers may be on a per capita, number, financial
26 interest, class, group or any other basis. Unless otherwise provided in an
27 operating agreement, if more than one manager is appointed, all managers
28 shall have an equal vote per capita.
29 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
30 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
31 voted on by any manager or class or group of managers, waiver of any
32 such notice, action by consent or approval without a meeting, the
33 establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or
34 by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right
35 to vote.
36 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
37 managers may be held by means of conference telephone or other
38 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
39 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
40 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
41 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
42 voted on, consented to or approved by the managers, the managers may
43 take such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
HB 2371—Am. by HC 28
1 vote, if consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or
2 by any other means permitted by law, by managers having not less than the
3 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
4 such action at a meeting at which all managers entitled to vote thereon
5 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
6 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a manager, consents to or
7 approves as a manager any matter and provides that such consent or
8 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
9 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
10 consented or approved as a manager at such future time, so long as such
11 person is then a manager. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
12 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers
13 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
14 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
15 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
16 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a manager
17 or by a person or persons authorized to act for a manager shall be deemed
18 to be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of
19 this subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
20 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
21 including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks
22 or databases, including one or more distributed electronic networks or
23 databases, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and
24 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
25 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
26 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 17-7698 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
27 7698. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member or
28 manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority to
29 delegate to one or more other persons any or all of the member's or
30 manager's, as the case may be, rights, powers and duties to manage and
31 control the business and affairs of the limited liability company. Any such
32 delegation may be made irrespective of whether the member or manager
33 has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter as to which its rights,
34 powers or duties are being delegated, and the person or persons to whom
35 any such rights, powers or duties are being delegated shall not be deemed
36 conflicted solely by reason of the conflict of interest of the member or
37 manager. Any such delegation may be to agents, officers and employees
38 of a member or manager or the limited liability company, and by a
39 management agreement or another agreement with, or otherwise to, other
40 persons, including a committee of one or more persons. Unless otherwise
41 provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a member or
42 manager shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable. Unless
43 otherwise provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a
HB 2371—Am. by HC 29
1 member or manager of a limited liability company shall not cause the
2 member or manager to cease to be a member or manager, as the case may
3 be, of the limited liability company or cause the person to whom any such
4 rights, powers and duties have been delegated to be a member or manager,
5 as the case may be, of the limited liability company. No other provision of
6 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or other law shall be
7 construed to restrict a member's or manager's power and authority to
8 delegate any or all of its rights, powers, and duties to manage and control
9 the business and affairs of the limited liability company.
10 Sec. 15. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 17-76,136 is hereby amended to read as
11 follows: 17-76,136. (a) The secretary of state shall charge each domestic
12 and foreign limited liability company the following fees:
13 (1) A fee of $20 for issuing or filing and indexing any of the
14 following documents:

20 (D) a certificate of change of location of registered office or resident
21 agent;
22 (E) a certificate of merger or consolidation;
23 (F) a certificate of division; and

25 for in the Kansas revised limited liability company act, for which no
26 different fee is specifically prescribed;
27 (2) a fee of $7.50 for each certified copy, regardless of whether the
28 secretary of state supplies the copy;
29 (3) a fee of $7.50 for each certificate of good standing, including a
30 certificate of good standing for a series of a limited liability company,
31 issued by the secretary of state; and
32 (4) a fee of $20 for a copy of an instrument on file or prepared by the
33 secretary of state's office, whether or not the copy is certified.
34 (b) Every limited liability company hereafter formed in this state shall
35 pay to the secretary of state, at the time of filing its articles of organization,
36 an application and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of
37 the secretary of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
38 (c) At the time of filing its application to do business, every foreign
39 limited liability company shall pay to the secretary of state an application
40 and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of the secretary
41 of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
42 (d) The fee for filing a certificate of reinstatement shall be the same
43 as that prescribed by K.S.A. 17-7506, and amendments thereto, for filing a
HB 2371—Am. by HC 30
1 certificate of reinstatement of a corporation's articles of incorporation.
2 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 17-76,143 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
3 76,143. (a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the
4 establishment of one or more designated series of members, managers,
5 limited liability company interests or assets. If an operating agreement so
6 provides for the establishment or formation of one or more series, then a
7 series may be formed by complying with this section. Any such series may
8 have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or
9 obligations of the limited liability company or profits and losses associated
10 with specified property or obligations, and to the extent provided in the
11 operating agreement, any such series may have a separate business
12 purpose or investment objective. A series is formed by the filing of a
13 certificate of designation in the office of the secretary of state. Other than
14 pursuant to K.S.A. 17-76,143a, and amendments thereto, a series may not
15 merge, convert, or consolidate pursuant to any section of the Kansas
16 revised limited liability company act, the business entity transactions act,
17 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto, or any other statute of
18 this state.
19 (b) Notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in
20 subsection (c) shall be set forth in the articles of organization of the limited
21 liability company. Notice in articles of organization of the limitation on
22 liabilities of a series as referenced in subsection (c) shall be sufficient for
23 all purposes of this subsection whether or not the limited liability company
24 has formed any series when such notice is included in the articles of
25 organization, and there shall be no requirement that any specific series of
26 the limited liability company be referenced in such notice. The fact that
27 articles of organization that contain the foregoing notice of the limitation
28 on liabilities of a series is on file in the office of the secretary of state shall
29 constitute notice of such limitation on liabilities of a series.
30 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Kansas
31 revised limited liability company act or under other applicable law, in the
32 event that an operating agreement establishes or provides for the
33 establishment of one or more series, and if to the extent the records
34 maintained for any series account for the assets associated with such series
35 separately from the other assets of the limited liability company, or any
36 other series thereof, and if the operating agreement so provides, and if
37 notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this
38 subsection is set forth in the articles of organization of the limited liability
39 company and if the limited liability company has filed a certificate of
40 designation for each series which that is to have limited liability under this
41 section, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred,
42 contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such series shall be
43 enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets
HB 2371—Am. by HC 31
1 of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, and,
2 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, none of the debts,
3 liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise
4 existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any
5 other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.
6 Neither the preceding sentences nor any provision pursuant thereto in an
7 operating agreement, articles of organization or certificate of designation
8 shall: Restrict a series or limited liability company on behalf of a series
9 from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of
10 the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
11 otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally
12 or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such
13 series; or restrict a limited liability company from agreeing in the
14 operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, liabilities,
15 obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing
16 with respect to a series shall be enforceable against the assets of the
17 limited liability company generally. Assets associated with a series may be
18 held directly or indirectly, including in the name of such series, in the
19 name of the limited liability company, through a nominee or otherwise.
20 Records maintained for a series that reasonably identify its assets,
21 including by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational, or
22 allocational formula or procedure, including a percentage or share of any
23 asset or assets, or by any other method where the identity of such assets is
24 objectively determinable, will be deemed to account for the assets
25 associated with such series separately from the other assets of the limited
26 liability company, or any other series thereof. As used in the Kansas
27 revised limited liability company act, a reference to assets of a series
28 includes assets associated with such series, a reference to assets associated
29 with a series includes assets of such series, a reference to members or
30 managers of a series includes members or managers associated with such
31 series, and a reference to members or managers associated with a series
32 includes members or managers of such series. The following shall apply to
33 a series:
34 (1) A series may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity,
35 whether or not for profit, with the exception of the business of granting
36 policies of insurance, assuming insurance risks, or banking as defined in
37 K.S.A. 9-702, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise provided in an
38 operating agreement, a series shall have the power and capacity to, in its
39 own name, contract, hold title to assets, including real, personal, and
40 intangible property, grant liens and security interests, and sue and be sued
41 and otherwise conduct business and exercise the power of a limited
42 liability company under this article. The limited liability company and
43 any of its series may elect to consolidate its operations as a single
HB 2371—Am. by HC 32
1 taxpayer to the extent required to file consolidated tax returns as
2 permitted under applicable law and elect to be treated as a single
3 business for the purposes of qualification or authorization to do
4 business in this or any other state. Such elections shall not affect the
5 limitation of liability set forth in this section except to the extent that
6 the series have specifically accepted joint liability by contract.
7 (2) Except as otherwise provided by the Kansas revised limited
8 liability company act, no member or manager of a series shall be obligated
9 personally for any debt, obligation or liability of such series, whether
10 arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member
11 or acting as manager of such series. Notwithstanding the preceding
12 sentence, under an operating agreement or under another agreement, a
13 member or manager may agree to be obligated personally for any or all of
14 the debts, obligations and liabilities of one or more series.
15 (3) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
16 members or managers associated with a series having such relative rights,
17 powers and duties as the operating agreement may provide, and may make
18 provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the operating
19 agreement of additional classes or groups of members or managers
20 associated with such series having such relative rights, powers and duties
21 as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and
22 duties senior to existing classes and groups of members or managers
23 associated with such series. An operating agreement may provide for the
24 taking of an action, including the amendment of the operating agreement,
25 without the vote, consent or approval of any member or manager or class
26 or group of members or managers, including an action to create under the
27 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of a series of
28 limited liability company interests that was not previously outstanding. An
29 operating agreement may provide that any member or class or group of
30 members associated with a series shall have no voting rights or ability to
31 otherwise participate in the management or governance of such series,
32 but any such member or class or group of members are owners of the
33 series.
34 (4) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
35 members or managers or a specified class or group of the members or
36 managers associated with a series the right to vote separately or with all or
37 any class or group of the members or managers associated with such
38 series, on any matter. Voting by members or managers associated with a
39 series may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or
40 any other basis.
41 (5) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the
42 management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with
43 such series in proportion to the then-current percentage or other interest of
HB 2371—Am. by HC 33
1 members in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
2 associated with such series, the decision of members owning more than
3 50% of such percentage or other interest in the profits controlling, except
4 that if an operating agreement provides for the management of a series, in
5 whole or in part, by a manager or managers, the management of such
6 series, to the extent so provided, shall be vested in the manager or
7 managers who shall be chosen in the manner provided in the operating
8 agreement. The manager of a series shall also hold the offices and have the
9 responsibilities accorded to the manager as set forth in an operating
10 agreement. A series may have more than one manager. Subject to K.S.A.
11 17-76,105, and amendments thereto, a manager shall cease to be a
12 manager with respect to a series as provided in an operating agreement.
13 Except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event under
14 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or in an operating
15 agreement that causes a manager to cease to be a manager with respect to a
16 series shall not, in itself, cause such manager to cease to be a manager of
17 the limited liability company or with respect to any other series thereof.
18 (6) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,109, and amendments thereto, but
19 subject to subsections (c)(7) and (c)(10), and unless otherwise provided in
20 an operating agreement, at the time a member of a series becomes entitled
21 to receive a distribution with respect to such series, the member has the
22 status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of such
23 series, with respect to the distribution. An operating agreement may
24 provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations
25 and distributions with respect to a series.
26 (7) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,110(a), and amendments thereto, a
27 limited liability company may make a distribution with respect to a series.
28 A limited liability company shall not make a distribution with respect to a
29 series to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after
30 giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of such series, other than
31 liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company
32 interests with respect to such series and liabilities for which the recourse of
33 creditors is limited to specified property of such series, exceed the fair
34 value of the assets associated with such series, except that the fair value of
35 property of such series that is subject to a liability for which the recourse
36 of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets associated with such
37 series only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that
38 liability. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
39 "distribution" shall not include amounts constituting reasonable
40 compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in
41 the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or
42 other benefits program. A member who receives a distribution in violation
43 of this subsection, and who knew at the time of the distribution that the
HB 2371—Am. by HC 34
1 distribution violated this subsection, shall be liable to the series for the
2 amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in
3 violation of this subsection, and who did not know at the time of the
4 distribution that the distribution violated this subsection, shall not be liable
5 for the amount of the distribution. Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,110(c), and
6 amendments thereto, which shall apply to any distribution made with
7 respect to a series under this subsection, this subsection shall not affect any
8 obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable
9 law for the amount of a distribution.
10 (8) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member
11 shall cease to be associated with a series and to have the power to exercise
12 any rights or powers of a member with respect to such series upon the
13 assignment of all of the member's limited liability company interest with
14 respect to such series. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
15 agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability company
16 act or an operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be
17 associated with a series shall not, in itself, cause such member to cease to
18 be associated with any other series or terminate the continued membership
19 of a member in the limited liability company or cause the dissolution of
20 the series, regardless of whether such member was the last remaining
21 member associated with such series.
22 (9) Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments thereto, except to
23 the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series may be
24 dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the
25 limited liability company. The dissolution of a series shall not affect the
26 limitation on liabilities of such series provided by this subsection (c). A
27 series is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the dissolution of
28 the limited liability company under K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments
29 thereto, or otherwise upon the first to occur of the following:
30 (A) At the time specified in the operating agreement;
31 (B) upon the happening of events specified in the operating
32 agreement;
33 (C) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, upon the
34 vote, consent or approval of members associated with such series who own
35 2/ or more of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of
3
36 such series of the limited liability company owned by all of the members
37 associated with such series; or
38 (D) the dissolution of such series under subsection (c)(11).
39 (10) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,118(a), and amendments thereto,
40 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a manager
41 associated with a series who has not wrongfully dissolved such series or, if
42 none, the members associated with such series or a person consented to or
43 approved by the members associated with such series, in either case, by
HB 2371—Am. by HC 35
1 members who own more than 50% of the then-current percentage or other
2 interest in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
3 associated with such series, may wind up the affairs of such series, but the
4 district court, upon cause shown, may wind up the affairs of a series upon
5 application of any member or manager associated with such series, or the
6 member's personal representative or assignee, and in connection therewith,
7 may appoint a liquidating trustee. The persons winding up the affairs of a
8 series may, in the name of the limited liability company and for and on
9 behalf of the limited liability company and such series, take all actions
10 with respect to such series as are permitted under K.S.A. 17-76,118(b), and
11 amendments thereto. The persons winding up the affairs of a series shall
12 provide for the claims and obligations of such series and distribute the
13 assets of such series as provided in K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments
14 thereto, which section shall apply to the winding up and distribution of
15 assets of a series. Actions taken in accordance with this subsection shall
16 not affect the liability of members and shall not impose liability on a
17 liquidating trustee.
18 (11) On application by or for a member or manager associated with a
19 series, the district court may decree dissolution of such series whenever it
20 is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of such series in
21 conformity with an operating agreement.
22 (12) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a series is an
23 association, regardless of the number of members or managers, if any, of
24 such series.
25 (d) In order to form a series of a limited liability company, a
26 certificate of designation must be filed in accordance with this subsection.
27 (1) (A) A certificate of designation shall set forth:
28 (i) The name of the limited liability company; and

18 under the operating agreement to revoke a dissolution contemplated by
19 this paragraph; and
20 (B) in the case of dissolution under subsection (c)(9)(A) or (B), other

35 liability company in accordance with K.S.A. 17-76,145, and amendments
36 thereto.
37 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit
38 the accomplishment of a revocation of dissolution of a series by other

13 delay or defraud creditors of their just and lawful debts or damages,
14 or to defraud, shall be subject to K.S.A. 33-102, and amendments
15 thereto.
16 Sec. 17. K.S.A. 17-76,143a is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
17 76,143a. (a) Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, one or
18 more series may merge or consolidate with or into one or more other series
19 of the same limited liability company with such series as the agreement
20 shall provide being the surviving or resulting series. Unless otherwise
21 provided in the operating agreement, an agreement of merger or
22 consolidation shall be consented to or approved by each series that is to
23 merge or consolidate by members of such series who own more than 50%
24 of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of such series
25 owned by all of the members of such series. In connection with a merger
26 or consolidation hereunder, rights or securities of, or interests in, a series
27 which that is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be
28 exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights, or securities of, or
29 interests in, the surviving or resulting series or, in addition to or in lieu
30 thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights, or
31 securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102, and
32 amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting series in the
33 merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding or may be canceled.
34 Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, an agreement of merger or
35 consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for
36 such termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or
37 consolidation.
38 (b) If a series is merging or consolidating under this section, the
39 series surviving or resulting in or from the merger or consolidation shall
40 file a certificate of merger or consolidation of series executed by one or
41 more authorized persons on behalf of the series when it is the surviving or
42 resulting series in the office of the secretary of state. The certificate of
43 merger or consolidation of series shall state:
HB 2371—Am. by HC 40
1 (1) The name of each series that is to merge or consolidate and the
2 name of the limited liability company that formed such series;
3 (2) that an agreement of merger or consolidation has been consented
4 to or approved and executed by or on behalf of each series that is to merge
5 or consolidate;
6 (3) the name of the surviving or resulting series;
7 (4) such amendment amendments, if any, to the certificate of
8 designation of the series that is the surviving or resulting series to change
9 the name of the surviving series, as is are desired to be effected by the
10 merger, and such amendments may amend and restate the certificate of
11 designation of the surviving series in its enirety;
12 (5) the future effective date or time, which shall be a date or time
13 certain, of the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the
14 filing of the certificate of merger or consolidation;
15 (6) that the agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at a place
16 of business of the surviving or resulting series or the limited liability
17 company that formed such series and shall state the address thereof; and
18 (7) that a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be
19 furnished by the surviving or resulting series, upon request and without
20 cost, to any member of any series that is to merge or consolidate.
21 (c) Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate of
22 merger or consolidation, a merger or consolidation of series pursuant to
23 this section shall be effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger or
24 consolidation of series in the office of the secretary of state.
25 (d) A certificate of merger or consolidation of series shall act as a
26 certificate of cancellation of the certificate of designation of the series that
27 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation. A
28 certificate of merger or consolidation of series that sets forth any
29 amendment in accordance with subsection (b)(4) shall be deemed to be an
30 amendment to the certificate of designation of the surviving or resulting
31 series, and no further action shall be required to amend the certificate of
32 designation of the surviving or resulting series under K.S.A. 17-76,143,
33 and amendments thereto, with respect to such amendments set forth in the
34 such certificate of merger or consolidation of series. Whenever this section
35 requires the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation of series, such
36 requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of
37 merger or consolidation containing the information required by this section
38 to be set forth in the such certificate of merger or consolidation.
39 (e) An agreement of merger or consolidation consented to or
40 approved in accordance with subsection (a) may effect any amendment to
41 the operating agreement relating solely to the series that are constituent
42 parties to the merger or consolidation. Any amendment to an operating
43 agreement relating solely to the series that are constituent parties to the
HB 2371—Am. by HC 41
1 merger or consolidation made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be
2 effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation and
3 shall be effective notwithstanding any provision of the operating
4 agreement relating to amendment of the operating agreement, other than a
5 provision that by its terms applies to an amendment to the operating
6 agreement in connection with a merger or consolidation. The provisions of
7 this subsection shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a
8 merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by any other means
9 provided for in an operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise
10 permitted by law, including that the operating agreement relating to any
11 constituent series to the merger or consolidation, including a series formed
12 for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the
13 operating agreement of the surviving or resulting series.
14 (f) (1) (A) When any merger or consolidation shall have become
15 effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of
16 Kansas, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the series that
17 have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
18 and all debts due to any of such series, as well as all other things and
19 causes of action belonging to each of such series, shall be vested in the
20 surviving or resulting series, and shall thereafter be the property of the
21 surviving or resulting series as they were of each of the series that have
22 merged or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or
23 otherwise, under the laws of the state of Kansas, in any of such series,
24 shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Kansas revised
25 limited liability company act.
26 (B) All rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of
27 the series that have merged or consolidated shall be preserved unimpaired,
28 and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of such series that have merged
29 or consolidated shall thereafter attach to the surviving or resulting series,
30 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts,
31 liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.
32 (2) Unless otherwise agreed, a merger or consolidation of a series that
33 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation, shall
34 not require such series to wind up its affairs under K.S.A. 17-76,143, and
35 amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under
36 K.S.A. 17-76,143, and amendments thereto, and the merger or
37 consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such series.
38 (g) An operating agreement may provide that a series of such limited
39 liability company shall not have the power to merge or consolidate as set
40 forth in this section.
41 (h) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2020.

26 limited liability company shall be managed in a manner that balances the
27 members' pecuniary interests, the best interests of those materially affected
28 by the limited liability company's conduct, and the public benefit or public
29 benefits set forth in its operating agreement and in its articles of
30 organization. A statutory public benefit limited liability company shall
31 state in its operating agreement and in the heading of its articles of
32 organization that it is a statutory public benefit limited liability company,
33 and shall set forth in its operating agreement and articles of organization
34 one or more specific public benefits to be promoted by the limited liability
35 company. In the event of any inconsistency between the public benefit or

39 persons who are party to or otherwise bound by the operating agreement.
40 A manager of a statutory public benefit limited liability company may not
41 contain any provision or, if there is no manager, then any member of a
42 statutory public benefit limited liability company who becomes aware that
43 the specific public benefit or benefits to be promoted by the limited
HB 2371—Am. by HC 46
1 liability company as set forth in its operating agreement are inaccurately
2 set forth in its articles of organization, shall promptly amend the articles
3 of organization. Any provision in the operating agreement or articles of
4 organization of a statutory public benefit limited liability company that is
5 inconsistent with K.S.A. 17-76,148 through 17-76,155, and amendments
6 thereto, shall not be effective to the extent of such inconsistency.
7 (b) "Public benefit" means a positive effect, or reduction of negative
8 effects, on one or more categories of persons, entities, communities or
9 interests, other than members in their capacities as members, including,

11 educational, environmental, literary, medical, religious, scientific or
12 technological nature. "Public benefit provisions" means the provisions of
13 the articles of organization, an operating agreement, or both, in either case
14 as contemplated by K.S.A. 17-76,148 through 17-76,155, and amendments

16 (c) If the name of a statutory public benefit limited liability company
17 does not contain the term "statutory public benefit limited liability
18 company," or the abbreviation "S.P.B.L.L.C.," or the designation
19 "SPBLLC," or words or abbreviations of like import in other languages if
20 they are written in Roman characters or letters, the statutory public benefit
21 limited liability company shall, prior to issuing any limited liability
22 company interest, provide notice to any person to whom such limited
23 liability company interest is issued that it is a statutory public benefit
24 limited liability company. Such notice need not be provided if the issuance
25 is pursuant to an offering registered under the securities act of 1933, 15
26 U.S.C. § 77r et seq., or if, at the time of issuance, the statutory public
27 benefit limited liability company has a class of securities that is registered
28 under the securities exchange act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.
29 Sec. 22. K.S.A. 17-76,151 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
30 76,151. (a) The members, managers or other persons with authority to
31 manage or direct the business and affairs of a statutory public benefit
32 limited liability company shall manage or direct the business and affairs of
33 the statutory public benefit limited liability company in a manner that
34 balances the pecuniary interests of the members, the best interests of those
35 materially affected by the limited liability company's conduct, and the
36 specific public benefit or public benefits set forth in its operating
37 agreement and articles of organization. Unless otherwise provided in an
38 operating agreement, a member, manager or other person with authority to
39 manage or direct the business and affairs of the statutory public benefit
40 limited liability company shall not have any liability for monetary
41 damages for the failure to manage or direct the business and affairs of the
42 statutory public benefit limited liability company as provided in this
43 subsection.
HB 2371—Am. by HC 47
1 (b) A member, manager or other person with authority to manage or
2 direct the business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited
3 liability company shall not, by virtue of the public benefit provisions or
4 K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 17-76,149(a), and amendments thereto, have any duty

6 benefit or public benefits set forth in its operating agreement and articles
7 of organization or on account of any interest materially affected by the
8 limited liability company's conduct and, with respect to a decision
9 implicating the balance requirement in subsection (a), will be deemed to
10 satisfy such person's fiduciary duties to members and the limited liability
11 company if such person's decision is both informed and disinterested and
12 not such that no person of ordinary, sound judgment would approve.
13 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 17-76,152 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
14 76,152. (a) A statutory public benefit limited liability company, at least
15 annually, shall provide its members with a statement as to the limited
16 liability company's promotion of the public benefit or public benefits set

30 benefits and interests.
31 (b) A statutory public benefit limited liability company shall provide
32 the statement in subsection (a) to its members at the time prescribed by

HB 2371—Am. by HC 48
1 relative weightings of those factors; and (C) the identity of the persons
2 who developed the standard and who control changes to the standard and
3 the process by which those changes are made. For purposes of this section,
4 the term "independent" means having no material relationship with the
5 statutory public benefit limited liability company or any of its members,
6 managers, affiliates or other persons with authority to manage or direct the
7 business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited liability
8 company.
9 (d) A statutory public benefit limited liability company shall post its
10 most recent statement described in subsection (a) on the public portion of
11 its website, if any, concurrently with the delivery of such statement to its
12 members under subsection (b). If a statutory public benefit limited liability
13 company does not have a website, it shall provide a copy of such
14 statement, without charge, to any person that requests a copy. Any
15 compensation paid to any person and any other financial or proprietary
16 information contained in the statement described in subsection (a) may be
17 omitted from any statement that is publicly posted or provided to any
18 person pursuant to this subsection, other than a statement provided to a
19 member, manager or other person with authority to manage or direct the
20 business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited liability
21 company.
22 (e) The articles of organization or the operating agreement of a
23 statutory public benefit limited liability company may require that the
24 statutory public benefit limited liability company obtain a periodic third-
25 party certification addressing the statutory public benefit limited liability
26 company's promotion of the public benefit or public benefits identified in

28 those materially affected by the statutory public benefit limited liability
29 company's conduct, or both.

24 7662, 17-7663, 17-7668, 17-7670, 17-7681, 17-7682, 17-7685a, 17-
25 7686, 17-7687, 17-7690, 17-7695, 17-7698, 17-76,143, 17-76,143a, 17-

30
31 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
32 New Section 1. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), without
33 limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be documented or
34 the manner in which a document may be signed or delivered:
35 (A) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the Kansas

HB 2371—Am. by HC 2
1 revised limited liability company act or the operating agreement may be
2 provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission is the
3 equivalent of a written document.
4 (B) Whenever the Kansas revised limited liability company act or the
5 operating agreement requires or permits a signature, the signature may be
6 a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. "Electronic
7 signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or
8 logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person
9 with an intent to execute, authenticate or adopt the document. A person
10 may execute a document with such person's signature.
11 (C) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or agreed
12 between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is delivered to
13 a person for purposes of the Kansas revised limited liability company act
14 and the operating agreement when it enters an information processing
15 system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving
16 electronic transmissions of the type delivered if the electronic transmission
17 is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is
18 able to retrieve the electronic transmission. Whether a person has so
19 designated an information processing system is determined by the
20 operating agreement or from the context and surrounding circumstances,
21 including the parties' conduct. An electronic transmission is delivered
22 under this section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an
23 electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system
24 establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does
25 not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
26 (2) The Kansas revised limited liability company act shall not
27 prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance
28 with the uniform electronic transactions act, K.S.A. 16-601 et seq., and
29 amendments thereto, if the part or parts of the transaction that are
30 governed by the Kansas revised limited liability company act are
31 documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this subsection or
32 otherwise in accordance with the Kansas revised limited liability company
33 act. This subsection shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether
34 an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been
35 signed and delivered, in accordance with the Kansas revised limited
36 liability company act and the operating agreement.
37 (b) (1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to:
38 (A) A document filed with or submitted to the secretary of state or a
39 court or other judicial or governmental body of this state;
40 (B) a certificate of limited liability company interest, except that a
41 signature on a certificate of limited liability company interest may be
42 manual, facsimile or electronic signature; and
43 (C) an act or transaction effected pursuant to article 79 of chapter 17

HB 2371—Am. by HC 3
1 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A. 17-
2 7667, 17-76,130, 17-76,131, 17-76,132 and 17-76,133, and amendments
3 thereto.
4 (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not create any presumption
5 about the lawful means to document a matter addressed by this subsection
6 or the lawful means to sign or deliver a document addressed by this
7 subsection. A provision of the operating agreement shall not limit the
8 application of subsection (a) unless the provision expressly restricts one or
9 more of the means of documenting an act or transaction, or of signing or
10 delivering a document, permitted by subsection (a).
11 (c) In the event that any provision of the Kansas revised limited
12 liability company act is deemed to modify, limit or supersede the federal
13 electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. §
14 7001 et. seq., the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
15 company act shall control to the fullest extent permitted by 15 U.S.C. §
16 7002(a)(2).
17 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
18 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
19 New Sec. 2. (a) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a
20 subscription for a limited liability company interest, whether submitted in
21 writing, by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
22 applicable law, is irrevocable if the subscription states that such
23 subscription is irrevocable to the extent provided by the terms of the
24 subscription.
25 (b) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
26 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
27 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 17-7662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
28 7662. K.S.A. 17-7662 through 17-76,142, and amendments thereto, and
29 K.S.A. 17-76,143 through 17-76,146, 17-7676a, 17-7685a, 17-76,143a and
30 17-76,147 through 17-76,155, and amendments thereto, and sections 1
31 and 2, and amendments thereto, shall be known and may be cited as the
32 Kansas revised limited liability company act.
33 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 17-7663 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
34 7663. As used in the Kansas revised limited liability company act unless
35 the context otherwise requires:
36 (a) "Articles of organization" means the articles of organization
37 referred to in K.S.A. 17-7673, and amendments thereto, and the articles of
38 organization as amended.
39 (b) "Bankruptcy" means an event that causes a person to cease to be a
40 member as provided in K.S.A. 17-7689, and amendments thereto.
41 (c) "Contribution" means any cash, property, services rendered or a
42 promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or property or to
43 perform services, which that a person contributes to a limited liability

HB 2371—Am. by HC 4

30 transaction that may be taken by or in respect of a limited liability
31 company under the Kansas revised limited liability company act or an
32 operating agreement, but that is void or voidable when taken, may be
33 ratified, or the failure to comply with any requirements of the operating
34 agreement making such act or transaction void or voidable may be
35 waived, by the members, managers or other persons whose approval
36 would be required under the operating agreement (i) for such act or

40 (B) If the void or voidable act or transaction was the issuance or
41 assignment of any limited liability company interests, the limited liability

HB 2371—Am. by HC 9
1 or voidable act or transaction was ratified or waived pursuant to this
2 subsection.
3 (2) Any act or transaction that is ratified, or with respect to which the
4 failure to comply with any requirements of the operating agreement is
5 waived, pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed validly taken at the
6 time of such act or transaction.
7 (3) If an amendment to the operating agreement to permit any such
8 act or transaction to be validly taken would require notice to any
9 members, managers or other persons under the operating agreement and
10 the ratification or waiver of such act or transaction is effectuated pursuant
11 to this subsection by the members, managers or other persons whose
12 approval would be required to amend the operating agreement, notice of
13 such ratification or waiver shall be given following such ratification or
14 waiver to the members, managers or other persons who would have been
15 entitled to notice of such an amendment and who have not otherwise
16 received notice of, or participated in, such ratification or waiver.

24 taken, the district court may hear and determine the validity and
25 effectiveness of the ratification of, or waiver with respect to, any void or
26 voidable act or transaction effectuated pursuant to this subsection. In any
27 such application, the limited liability company shall be named as a party
28 and service of the application upon the resident agent of the limited
29 liability company shall be deemed to be service upon the limited liability
30 company, and no other party need be joined in order for the court to
31 adjudicate the validity and effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The
32 court may make such order respecting further or other notice of such
33 application as it deems proper under these circumstances. Nothing in this
34 paragraph limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner
35 now or hereafter provided by law, and this provision is an extension of and
36 not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal
37 process upon nonresidents.

8 company, or is or was serving at the request of the limited liability
9 company as a member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of
10 another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture,
11 trust or other enterprise, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,

30 foreign jurisdiction, or any combination thereof, with such limited liability
31 company as the agreement shall provide being the surviving or resulting

37 percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited liability
38 company owned by all of the members;
39 (B) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a limited
40 liability company whose original articles of organization were filed with

15 or securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102,
16 and amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting limited
17 liability company in the merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding,
18 or may be canceled.
19 (3) Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, an agreement of
20 merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a

19 surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or

36 (2)(B) effect the adoption of a new operating agreement, for a limited
37 liability company if it is the surviving or resulting limited liability
38 company in the merger or consolidation.
39 (2) Any amendment to an operating agreement or adoption of a new
40 operating agreement made pursuant to the foregoing sentence paragraph
41 (1) shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
42 consolidation and shall be effective notwithstanding any provision of the
43 operating agreement relating to amendment or adoption of a new operating

HB 2371—Am. by HC 13
1 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
2 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
3 agreement, in either case, in connection with a merger or consolidation.
4 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the
5 accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by
6 any other means provided for in an operating agreement or other
7 agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the operating
8 agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or
9 consolidation, including a limited liability company formed for the
10 purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the operating
11 agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company.
12 (e) When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective
13 under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of
14 the rights, privileges and powers of each of the limited liability companies

16 mixed, and all debts due to any of the limited liability companies, as well
17 as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such limited
18 liability companies, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting limited
19 liability company, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or
20 resulting limited liability company as they were of each of the limited
21 liability companies that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any
22 real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state of
23 Kansas, in any of such limited liability companies, shall not revert or be in
24 any way impaired by reason of this act, but all rights of creditors and all
25 liens upon any property of any of the limited liability companies shall be
26 preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the
27 limited liability companies that have merged or consolidated shall
28 thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting limited liability company,
29 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities
30 and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed,
31 a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company,
32 including a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
33 surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not
34 require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs
35 under K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and
36 distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and
37 the merger or consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such
38 limited liability company.
39 (f) A limited liability company may merge or consolidate with or into
40 any other entity in accordance with the business entity transactions act,
41 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto.

9 amendment of an operating agreement, any merger or consolidation in
10 which the limited liability company or a series of the limited liability
11 company is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation, any division
12 of the limited liability company, or the sale of all or substantially all of the
13 limited liability company's assets. The district court shall have jurisdiction
14 to hear and determine any matter relating to any such appraisal rights
15 provided in an operating agreement or an agreement of merger or
16 consolidation or a plan of division.

37 liability company for such debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing
38 company as are allocated to such division company pursuant to the plan of
39 division in the manner and on the basis provided in subsection (g)(1)(B).

HB 2371—Am. by HC 20
1 and basis and with such effect as is specified in the plan of division, and no

5 unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company
6 shall remain attached to the division company to which such debts,
7 liabilities and duties have been allocated in the plan of division, and may

10 in its capacity as a domestic limited liability company.
11 (5) In the event that any allocation of assets, debts, liabilities and
12 duties to division companies in accordance with a plan of division is

26 property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties is objectively
27 determinable.

30 as the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company that have been
31 allocated to such division company pursuant to a plan of division, shall
32 remain vested in each such division company and shall not be deemed, as
33 a result of the division, to have been assigned or transferred to such

36 may be continued against the surviving company, if any, as if the division
37 did not occur, but subject to paragraph (4), and against any resulting
38 company to which the asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty
39 associated with such action or proceeding was allocated pursuant to the
40 plan of division by adding or substituting such resulting company as a
41 party in the action or proceeding.

HB 2371—Am. by HC 23
1 groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
2 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties

23 members may be held by means of conference telephone or other
24 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
25 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
26 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
27 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
28 voted on, consented to or approved by members, the members may take
29 such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if
30 consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or by any
31 other means permitted by law, by members having not less than the
32 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
33 such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon
34 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
35 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a member, consents to or
36 approves as a member any matter and provides that such consent or
37 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
38 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have

13 Kansas revised limited liability company act, every member holding an
14 interest in profits shall be entitled to vote.
15 (f) If an operating agreement provides for the manner in which it may
16 be amended, including by requiring the approval or consent of a person
17 who is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction of
18 conditions, it may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise
19 permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
20 amendments thereto, provided that the approval or consent of any person
21 may be waived by such person and that any such conditions may be
22 waived by all persons for whose benefit such conditions were intended.
23 Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a supermajority
24 amendment provision shall only apply to provisions of the operating
25 agreement that are expressly included in the operating agreement. As used
26 in this section, "supermajority amendment provision" means any

32 which it may be amended, the operating agreement may be amended with
33 the approval or consent of all of the members or as otherwise permitted by
34 law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and amendments
35 thereto. This subsection shall only apply to a limited liability company
36 whose original articles of organization were filed with the secretary of
37 state on or after July 1, 2014.
38 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 17-7690 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
39 7690. (a) Each member of a limited liability company, in person or by
40 attorney or other agent, has the right, subject to such reasonable standards,
41 including standards governing what information, including books, records
42 and other documents are, is to be furnished at what time and location and
43 at whose expense, as may be set forth in an operating agreement or

HB 2371—Am. by HC 25
1 otherwise established by the manager or, if there is no manager, then by
2 the members, to obtain from the limited liability company from time to
3 time upon reasonable demand for any purpose reasonably related to the
4 member's interest as a member of the limited liability company:
5 (1) True and full information regarding the status of the business and
6 financial condition of the limited liability company;
7 (2) promptly after becoming available, a copy of the limited liability
8 company's federal, state and local income tax returns for each year;
9 (3) a current list of the name and last known business, residence or
10 mailing address of each member and manager;
11 (4) a copy of any written operating agreement and articles of
12 organization and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of
13 any written powers of attorney pursuant to which the operating agreement
14 and any certificate and all amendments thereto have been executed;
15 (5) true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
16 description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or
17 services contributed by each member and which each member has agreed
18 to contribute in the future, and the date on which each became a member;
19 and
20 (6) other information regarding the affairs of the limited liability
21 company as is just and reasonable.
22 (b) Each manager shall have the right to examine all of the
23 information described in subsection (a) for a purpose reasonably related to
24 the position of manager.
25 (c) The manager of a limited liability company shall have the right to
26 keep confidential from the members, for such period of time as the
27 manager deems reasonable, any information which that the manager
28 reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information
29 the disclosure of which the manager in good faith believes is not in the
30 best interest of the limited liability company or could damage the limited
31 liability company or its business or which the limited liability company is
32 required by law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
33 (d) A limited liability company may maintain its books, records and
34 other documents in other than a written paper form, including on, by
35 means of, or in the form of any information storage device, method, or one
36 or more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
37 distributed electronic networks or databases, if such form is capable of
38 conversion into written paper form within a reasonable time.
39 (e) Any demand under this section shall be in writing and shall state
40 the purpose of such demand. In every instance where an attorney or other
41 agent is the person who seeks the right to obtain the information described
42 in subsection (a), the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
43 or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act

HB 2371—Am. by HC 26
1 on behalf of the member.
2 (f) Any action to enforce any right arising under this section shall be
3 brought in the district court. If the limited liability company refuses to
4 permit a member, or attorney or other agent acting for the member, to
5 obtain or a manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)
6 or does not reply to the demand that has been made within five business
7 days, or such shorter or longer period of time as is provided for in an
8 operating agreement, but not longer than 30 business days, after the
9 demand has been made, the demanding member or manager may apply to
10 the district court for an order to compel such disclosure. The district court
11 may summarily order the limited liability company to permit the
12 demanding member to obtain or manager to examine the information
13 described in subsection (a) and to make copies or abstracts therefrom, or
14 the district court may summarily order the limited liability company to
15 furnish to the demanding member or manager the information described in
16 subsection (a) on the condition that the demanding member or manager
17 first pay to the limited liability company the reasonable cost of obtaining
18 and furnishing such information and on such other conditions as the
19 district court deems appropriate. When a demanding member seeks to
20 obtain or a manager seeks to examine the information described in
21 subsection (a), the demanding member or manager shall first establish: (1)
22 That the demanding member or manager has complied with the provisions
23 of this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for
24 obtaining or examining of such information; and (2) that the information
25 the demanding member or manager seeks is reasonably related to the
26 member's interest as a member or the manager's position as a manager, as
27 the case may be. The district court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
28 limitations or conditions with reference to the obtaining or examining of
29 information, or award such other or further relief as the district court may
30 deem just and proper. The district court may order books, documents and
31 records and other documents, pertinent extracts therefrom, or duly
32 authenticated copies thereof, to be brought within the state of Kansas and
33 kept in the state of Kansas upon such terms and conditions as the order
34 may prescribe.
35 (g) If a member is entitled to obtain information under the Kansas
36 revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement for a
37 purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member or other
38 stated purpose, the member's right shall be to obtain such information as
39 is necessary and essential to achieving that purpose. The rights of a
40 member or manager to obtain or examine information as provided in this
41 section may be expanded or restricted in an original operating agreement
42 or in any subsequent amendment consented to, approved or adopted by all
43 of the members or in compliance with any applicable requirements of the

HB 2371—Am. by HC 27
1 operating agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
2 construed to limit the ability to impose restrictions on expand or restrict
3 the rights of a member or manager to obtain or examine information by
4 any other means permitted under the Kansas revised limited liability
5 company act by law.
6 (h) A limited liability company shall maintain a current record that
7 identifies the name and last known business, residence, or mailing address
8 of each member and manager.
9 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 17-7695 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
10 7695. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
11 managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
12 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
13 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
14 groups of managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
15 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
16 senior to existing classes and groups of managers. An operating agreement
17 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
18 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any manager
19 or class or group of managers, including an action to create under the
20 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability
21 company interests that was not previously outstanding.
22 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
23 managers or a specified class or group of the managers the right to vote,
24 separately or with all or any class or group of managers or members, on
25 any matter. Voting by managers may be on a per capita, number, financial
26 interest, class, group or any other basis. Unless otherwise provided in an
27 operating agreement, if more than one manager is appointed, all managers
28 shall have an equal vote per capita.
29 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
30 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
31 voted on by any manager or class or group of managers, waiver of any
32 such notice, action by consent or approval without a meeting, the
33 establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or
34 by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right
35 to vote.
36 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
37 managers may be held by means of conference telephone or other
38 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
39 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
40 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
41 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
42 voted on, consented to or approved by the managers, the managers may
43 take such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a

HB 2371—Am. by HC 28
1 vote, if consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or
2 by any other means permitted by law, by managers having not less than the
3 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
4 such action at a meeting at which all managers entitled to vote thereon
5 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
6 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a manager, consents to or
7 approves as a manager any matter and provides that such consent or
8 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
9 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
10 consented or approved as a manager at such future time, so long as such
11 person is then a manager. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
12 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers
13 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
14 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
15 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
16 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a manager
17 or by a person or persons authorized to act for a manager shall be deemed
18 to be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of
19 this subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
20 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
21 including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks
22 or databases, including one or more distributed electronic networks or
23 databases, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and
24 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
25 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
26 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 17-7698 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
27 7698. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member or
28 manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority to
29 delegate to one or more other persons any or all of the member's or
30 manager's, as the case may be, rights, powers and duties to manage and
31 control the business and affairs of the limited liability company. Any such
32 delegation may be made irrespective of whether the member or manager
33 has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter as to which its rights,
34 powers or duties are being delegated, and the person or persons to whom
35 any such rights, powers or duties are being delegated shall not be deemed
36 conflicted solely by reason of the conflict of interest of the member or
37 manager. Any such delegation may be to agents, officers and employees
38 of a member or manager or the limited liability company, and by a
39 management agreement or another agreement with, or otherwise to, other
40 persons, including a committee of one or more persons. Unless otherwise
41 provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a member or
42 manager shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable. Unless
43 otherwise provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a

HB 2371—Am. by HC 29
1 member or manager of a limited liability company shall not cause the
2 member or manager to cease to be a member or manager, as the case may
3 be, of the limited liability company or cause the person to whom any such
4 rights, powers and duties have been delegated to be a member or manager,
5 as the case may be, of the limited liability company. No other provision of
6 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or other law shall be
7 construed to restrict a member's or manager's power and authority to
8 delegate any or all of its rights, powers, and duties to manage and control
9 the business and affairs of the limited liability company.
10 Sec. 15. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 17-76,136 is hereby amended to read as
11 follows: 17-76,136. (a) The secretary of state shall charge each domestic
12 and foreign limited liability company the following fees:
13 (1) A fee of $20 for issuing or filing and indexing any of the
14 following documents:
15 (A) A certificate of amendment of articles of organization;
16 (B) restated articles of organization;
17 (C) a certificate of cancellation, which shall be multiplied by the
18 number of series of the limited liability company named in the certificate
19 of cancellation;
20 (D) a certificate of change of location of registered office or resident
21 agent;
22 (E) a certificate of merger or consolidation;
23 (F) a certificate of division; and
24 (G) any certificate, affidavit, agreement or any other paper provided
25 for in the Kansas revised limited liability company act, for which no
26 different fee is specifically prescribed;
27 (2) a fee of $7.50 for each certified copy, regardless of whether the
28 secretary of state supplies the copy;
29 (3) a fee of $7.50 for each certificate of good standing, including a
30 certificate of good standing for a series of a limited liability company,
31 issued by the secretary of state; and
32 (4) a fee of $20 for a copy of an instrument on file or prepared by the
33 secretary of state's office, whether or not the copy is certified.
34 (b) Every limited liability company hereafter formed in this state shall
35 pay to the secretary of state, at the time of filing its articles of organization,
36 an application and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of
37 the secretary of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
38 (c) At the time of filing its application to do business, every foreign
39 limited liability company shall pay to the secretary of state an application
40 and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of the secretary
41 of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
42 (d) The fee for filing a certificate of reinstatement shall be the same
43 as that prescribed by K.S.A. 17-7506, and amendments thereto, for filing a

HB 2371—Am. by HC 30
1 certificate of reinstatement of a corporation's articles of incorporation.
2 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 17-76,143 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
3 76,143. (a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the
4 establishment of one or more designated series of members, managers,
5 limited liability company interests or assets. If an operating agreement so
6 provides for the establishment or formation of one or more series, then a
7 series may be formed by complying with this section. Any such series may
8 have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or
9 obligations of the limited liability company or profits and losses associated
10 with specified property or obligations, and to the extent provided in the
11 operating agreement, any such series may have a separate business
12 purpose or investment objective. A series is formed by the filing of a
13 certificate of designation in the office of the secretary of state. Other than
14 pursuant to K.S.A. 17-76,143a, and amendments thereto, a series may not
15 merge, convert, or consolidate pursuant to any section of the Kansas
16 revised limited liability company act, the business entity transactions act,
17 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto, or any other statute of
18 this state.
19 (b) Notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in
20 subsection (c) shall be set forth in the articles of organization of the limited
21 liability company. Notice in articles of organization of the limitation on
22 liabilities of a series as referenced in subsection (c) shall be sufficient for
23 all purposes of this subsection whether or not the limited liability company
24 has formed any series when such notice is included in the articles of
25 organization, and there shall be no requirement that any specific series of
26 the limited liability company be referenced in such notice. The fact that
27 articles of organization that contain the foregoing notice of the limitation
28 on liabilities of a series is on file in the office of the secretary of state shall
29 constitute notice of such limitation on liabilities of a series.
30 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Kansas
31 revised limited liability company act or under other applicable law, in the
32 event that an operating agreement establishes or provides for the
33 establishment of one or more series, and if to the extent the records
34 maintained for any series account for the assets associated with such series
35 separately from the other assets of the limited liability company, or any
36 other series thereof, and if the operating agreement so provides, and if
37 notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this
38 subsection is set forth in the articles of organization of the limited liability
39 company and if the limited liability company has filed a certificate of
40 designation for each series which that is to have limited liability under this
41 section, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred,
42 contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such series shall be
43 enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets

HB 2371—Am. by HC 31
1 of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, and,
2 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, none of the debts,
3 liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise
4 existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any
5 other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.
6 Neither the preceding sentences nor any provision pursuant thereto in an
7 operating agreement, articles of organization or certificate of designation
8 shall: Restrict a series or limited liability company on behalf of a series
9 from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of
10 the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
11 otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally
12 or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such
13 series; or restrict a limited liability company from agreeing in the
14 operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, liabilities,
15 obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing
16 with respect to a series shall be enforceable against the assets of the
17 limited liability company generally. Assets associated with a series may be
18 held directly or indirectly, including in the name of such series, in the
19 name of the limited liability company, through a nominee or otherwise.
20 Records maintained for a series that reasonably identify its assets,
21 including by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational, or
22 allocational formula or procedure, including a percentage or share of any
23 asset or assets, or by any other method where the identity of such assets is
24 objectively determinable, will be deemed to account for the assets
25 associated with such series separately from the other assets of the limited
26 liability company, or any other series thereof. As used in the Kansas
27 revised limited liability company act, a reference to assets of a series
28 includes assets associated with such series, a reference to assets associated
29 with a series includes assets of such series, a reference to members or
30 managers of a series includes members or managers associated with such
31 series, and a reference to members or managers associated with a series
32 includes members or managers of such series. The following shall apply to
33 a series:
34 (1) A series may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity,
35 whether or not for profit, with the exception of the business of granting
36 policies of insurance, assuming insurance risks, or banking as defined in
37 K.S.A. 9-702, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise provided in an
38 operating agreement, a series shall have the power and capacity to, in its
39 own name, contract, hold title to assets, including real, personal, and
40 intangible property, grant liens and security interests, and sue and be sued
41 and otherwise conduct business and exercise the power of a limited
42 liability company under this article. The limited liability company and
43 any of its series may elect to consolidate its operations as a single

HB 2371—Am. by HC 32
1 taxpayer to the extent required to file consolidated tax returns as
2 permitted under applicable law and elect to be treated as a single
3 business for the purposes of qualification or authorization to do
4 business in this or any other state. Such elections shall not affect the
5 limitation of liability set forth in this section except to the extent that
6 the series have specifically accepted joint liability by contract.
7 (2) Except as otherwise provided by the Kansas revised limited
8 liability company act, no member or manager of a series shall be obligated
9 personally for any debt, obligation or liability of such series, whether
10 arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member
11 or acting as manager of such series. Notwithstanding the preceding
12 sentence, under an operating agreement or under another agreement, a
13 member or manager may agree to be obligated personally for any or all of
14 the debts, obligations and liabilities of one or more series.
15 (3) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
16 members or managers associated with a series having such relative rights,
17 powers and duties as the operating agreement may provide, and may make
18 provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the operating
19 agreement of additional classes or groups of members or managers
20 associated with such series having such relative rights, powers and duties
21 as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and
22 duties senior to existing classes and groups of members or managers
23 associated with such series. An operating agreement may provide for the
24 taking of an action, including the amendment of the operating agreement,
25 without the vote, consent or approval of any member or manager or class
26 or group of members or managers, including an action to create under the
27 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of a series of
28 limited liability company interests that was not previously outstanding. An
29 operating agreement may provide that any member or class or group of
30 members associated with a series shall have no voting rights or ability to
31 otherwise participate in the management or governance of such series,
32 but any such member or class or group of members are owners of the
33 series.
34 (4) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
35 members or managers or a specified class or group of the members or
36 managers associated with a series the right to vote separately or with all or
37 any class or group of the members or managers associated with such
38 series, on any matter. Voting by members or managers associated with a
39 series may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or
40 any other basis.
41 (5) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the
42 management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with
43 such series in proportion to the then-current percentage or other interest of

HB 2371—Am. by HC 33
1 members in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
2 associated with such series, the decision of members owning more than
3 50% of such percentage or other interest in the profits controlling, except
4 that if an operating agreement provides for the management of a series, in
5 whole or in part, by a manager or managers, the management of such
6 series, to the extent so provided, shall be vested in the manager or
7 managers who shall be chosen in the manner provided in the operating
8 agreement. The manager of a series shall also hold the offices and have the
9 responsibilities accorded to the manager as set forth in an operating
10 agreement. A series may have more than one manager. Subject to K.S.A.
11 17-76,105, and amendments thereto, a manager shall cease to be a
12 manager with respect to a series as provided in an operating agreement.
13 Except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event under
14 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or in an operating
15 agreement that causes a manager to cease to be a manager with respect to a
16 series shall not, in itself, cause such manager to cease to be a manager of
17 the limited liability company or with respect to any other series thereof.
18 (6) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,109, and amendments thereto, but
19 subject to subsections (c)(7) and (c)(10), and unless otherwise provided in
20 an operating agreement, at the time a member of a series becomes entitled
21 to receive a distribution with respect to such series, the member has the
22 status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of such
23 series, with respect to the distribution. An operating agreement may
24 provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations
25 and distributions with respect to a series.
26 (7) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,110(a), and amendments thereto, a
27 limited liability company may make a distribution with respect to a series.
28 A limited liability company shall not make a distribution with respect to a
29 series to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after
30 giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of such series, other than
31 liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company
32 interests with respect to such series and liabilities for which the recourse of
33 creditors is limited to specified property of such series, exceed the fair
34 value of the assets associated with such series, except that the fair value of
35 property of such series that is subject to a liability for which the recourse
36 of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets associated with such
37 series only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that
38 liability. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
39 "distribution" shall not include amounts constituting reasonable
40 compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in
41 the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or
42 other benefits program. A member who receives a distribution in violation
43 of this subsection, and who knew at the time of the distribution that the

HB 2371—Am. by HC 34
1 distribution violated this subsection, shall be liable to the series for the
2 amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in
3 violation of this subsection, and who did not know at the time of the
4 distribution that the distribution violated this subsection, shall not be liable
5 for the amount of the distribution. Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,110(c), and
6 amendments thereto, which shall apply to any distribution made with
7 respect to a series under this subsection, this subsection shall not affect any
8 obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable
9 law for the amount of a distribution.
10 (8) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member
11 shall cease to be associated with a series and to have the power to exercise
12 any rights or powers of a member with respect to such series upon the
13 assignment of all of the member's limited liability company interest with
14 respect to such series. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
15 agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability company
16 act or an operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be
17 associated with a series shall not, in itself, cause such member to cease to
18 be associated with any other series or terminate the continued membership
19 of a member in the limited liability company or cause the dissolution of
20 the series, regardless of whether such member was the last remaining
21 member associated with such series.
22 (9) Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments thereto, except to
23 the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series may be
24 dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the
25 limited liability company. The dissolution of a series shall not affect the
26 limitation on liabilities of such series provided by this subsection (c). A
27 series is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the dissolution of
28 the limited liability company under K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments
29 thereto, or otherwise upon the first to occur of the following:
30 (A) At the time specified in the operating agreement;
31 (B) upon the happening of events specified in the operating
32 agreement;
33 (C) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, upon the
34 vote, consent or approval of members associated with such series who own
35 2/ or more of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of
3
36 such series of the limited liability company owned by all of the members
37 associated with such series; or
38 (D) the dissolution of such series under subsection (c)(11).
39 (10) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,118(a), and amendments thereto,
40 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a manager
41 associated with a series who has not wrongfully dissolved such series or, if
42 none, the members associated with such series or a person consented to or
43 approved by the members associated with such series, in either case, by

29 benefits set forth in its operating agreement and in its articles of
30 organization. A statutory public benefit limited liability company shall
31 state in its operating agreement and in the heading of its articles of

42 statutory public benefit limited liability company who becomes aware that
43 the specific public benefit or benefits to be promoted by the limited

HB 2371—Am. by HC 46
1 liability company as set forth in its operating agreement are inaccurately
2 set forth in its articles of organization, shall promptly amend the articles
3 of organization. Any provision in the operating agreement or articles of
4 organization of a statutory public benefit limited liability company that is

16 (c) If the name of a statutory public benefit limited liability company
17 does not contain the term "statutory public benefit limited liability
18 company," or the abbreviation "S.P.B.L.L.C.," or the designation
19 "SPBLLC," or words or abbreviations of like import in other languages if
20 they are written in Roman characters or letters, the statutory public benefit
21 limited liability company shall, prior to issuing any limited liability
22 company interest, provide notice to any person to whom such limited
23 liability company interest is issued that it is a statutory public benefit
24 limited liability company. Such notice need not be provided if the issuance
25 is pursuant to an offering registered under the securities act of 1933, 15
26 U.S.C. § 77r et seq., or if, at the time of issuance, the statutory public
27 benefit limited liability company has a class of securities that is registered

40 limited liability company shall not have any liability for monetary
41 damages for the failure to manage or direct the business and affairs of the
42 statutory public benefit limited liability company as provided in this
43 subsection.

HB 2371—Am. by HC 47
1 (b) A member, manager or other person with authority to manage or
2 direct the business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited
3 liability company shall not, by virtue of the public benefit provisions or

2 who developed the standard and who control changes to the standard and

5 statutory public benefit limited liability company or any of its members,
6 managers, affiliates or other persons with authority to manage or direct the
7 business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited liability
8 company.

13 company does not have a website, it shall provide a copy of such
14 statement, without charge, to any person that requests a copy. Any
15 compensation paid to any person and any other financial or proprietary
16 information contained in the statement described in subsection (a) may be
17 omitted from any statement that is publicly posted or provided to any
18 person pursuant to this subsection, other than a statement provided to a

21 company.

9 directed; and

11 agent documents sent by the secretary of state.
12 (c) Unless the context otherwise requires, whenever the term
13 "resident agent" or "registered agent" or "resident agent in charge of a
14 (applicable covered entity's) principal office or place of business in this
15 state," or other term of like import which that refers to a covered entity's
16 agent required by statute to be located in this state, is or has been used in a
17 covered entity's public organic documents, or in any other document, or in
18 any statute, it shall be deemed to mean and refer to the covered entity's
19 resident agent required by this section, and it shall not be necessary for any
20 covered entity to amend its public organic documents, or any other
21 document, to comply with this section.
22 Sec. 32. K.S.A. 17-7927 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
23 7927. (a) A resident agent may change the address of the registered office
24 of any covered entities for which such agent is resident agent to another
25 address in this state by paying a fee if authorized by law, as provided by
26 K.S.A. 17-7910, and amendments thereto, and filing with the secretary of
27 state a certificate, executed by such resident agent, setting forth the names
28 of all the covered entities represented by such resident agent, and the
29 address at which such resident agent has maintained the registered office
30 for each of such covered entities, and further certifying to the new address
31 to which each such registered office will be changed on a given day, and at
32 which new address such resident agent will thereafter maintain the
33 registered office for each of the covered entities recited in the certificate.
34 Thereafter, or until further change of address, as authorized by law, the
35 registered office in this state of each of the covered entities for which it is
36 a resident agent shall be located at the new address of the resident agent
37 thereof as given in the certificate.
38 (b) Whenever the location of a resident agent's office is moved to
39 another room or suite within the same structure and such change is
40 reported in writing to the secretary of state, no fee shall be charged for
41 recording such change on the appropriate records on file with the secretary
42 of state.
43 (c) In the event of a change of name of any person or entity acting as

HB 2371—Am. by HC 58
1 resident agent in this state, such resident agent shall pay a fee if authorized
2 by law, as provided by K.S.A. 17-7910, and amendments thereto, and file
3 with the secretary of state a certificate, executed by such resident agent,
4 setting forth the new name of such resident agent, the name of such
5 resident agent before it was changed, the names of all the covered entities
6 represented by such resident agent, and the address at which such resident
7 agent has maintained the registered office for each of such covered
8 entities. A change of name of any person or entity acting as a resident
9 agent as a result of the following shall be deemed a change of name for
10 purposes of this section:
11 (1) A merger or consolidation of the resident agent, with or into
12 another entity which that succeeds to its assets by operation of law, shall
13 be deemed a change of name for purposes of this section;
14 (2) the conversion of the resident agent into another person; or
15 (3) a division of the resident agent in which an identified resulting
16 person succeeds to all of the assets and liabilities of the resident agent
17 related to its resident agent business pursuant to the plan of division, as
18 set forth in the certificate of division.
19 (d) In the event of both a change of name of any person or entity
20 acting as resident agent for any covered entity and a change of address,
21 such resident agent shall pay a fee if authorized by law, as provided by
22 K.S.A. 17-7910, and amendments thereto, and file with the secretary of
23 state a certificate, executed by such resident agent, setting forth the new
24 name of such resident agent, the name of such resident agent before it was
25 changed, the names of all the covered entities represented by such resident
26 agent and the address at which such resident agent has maintained the
27 registered office for each such covered entity, and further certifying to the
28 new address to which each such registered office will be changed on a
29 given day, and at which new address such resident agent will thereafter
30 maintain the registered office for each of the covered entities recited in the
31 certificate. Upon the filing of such certificate, and thereafter, or until
32 further change of address or change of name, as authorized by law, the
33 registered office in this state of each of the covered entities recited in the
34 certificate shall be located at the new address of the resident agent as given
35 in the certificate and the change of name shall be effective.
36 Sec. 33. K.S.A. 17-7929 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
37 7929. (a) The resident agent of a covered entity, including a resident agent
38 that no longer qualifies to be a resident agent under K.S.A. 17-7925, and
39 amendments thereto, may resign without appointing a successor by paying
40 a fee if authorized by law, as provided by K.S.A. 17-7910, and
41 amendments thereto, and filing a certificate of resignation, with the
42 secretary of state stating that the resident agent resigns as resident agent
43 for the covered entity or entities identified in the certificate, but such

HB 2371—Am. by HC 59
1 resignation shall not become effective until 30 days after the certificate is
2 filed. The certificate shall be executed by the resident agent, shall contain a
3 statement that written notice of resignation was given to each affected the
4 covered entity at least 30 days prior to the filing of the certificate by
5 mailing or delivering such notice to the covered entity at its address last
6 known to the resident agent and shall set forth the date of such notice. The
7 certificate shall also include the postal address and name and contact
8 information of an officer, director, employee or designated agent who is
9 then authorized to receive communications from the resident agent with
10 respect to the affected covered entities last known to the resident agent,
11 and such information shall not be deemed public information and will not
12 constitute a public record as defined in K.S.A. 45-217, and amendments
13 thereto.
14 (b) After receipt of the notice of the resignation of its resident agent,
15 provided for in subsection (a), any covered entity for which such resident
16 agent was acting shall obtain and designate a new resident agent to take
17 the place of the resident agent so resigning. Such covered entity shall pay a
18 fee if authorized by law, as provided by K.S.A. 17-7910, and amendments
19 thereto, and file with the secretary of state a certificate setting forth the
20 name and postal address of the successor resident agent. Upon such filing,
21 the successor resident agent shall become the resident agent of such
22 covered entity and the successor resident agent's postal address, as stated
23 in such certificate, shall become the postal address of the covered entity's
24 registered office in this state. If such covered entity fails to obtain and
25 designate a new resident agent as aforesaid, prior to the expiration of the
26 period of 60 days after the filing by the resident agent of the certificate of
27 resignation, the secretary of state shall declare the entity's organizing
28 documents forfeited.
29 (c) After the resignation of the resident agent shall have become
30 effective, as provided in subsection (a), and if no new resident agent shall
31 have been obtained and designated in the time and manner provided for in
32 subsection (b), service of legal process against the covered entity, or in the
33 case of a domestic or foreign limited liability company, any series of such
34 limited liability company, for which the resigned resident agent had been
35 acting shall thereafter be upon the secretary of state in the manner
36 prescribed by K.S.A. 60-304, and amendments thereto.
37 (d) Any covered entity affected by the filing of a certificate under this
38 section shall not be required to take any further action to amend its public
39 organic documents to reflect a change of registered office or resident
40 agent.
