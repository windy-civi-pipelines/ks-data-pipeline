31 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
32 New Section 1. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), without
33 limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be documented or
HB 2371—Am. by SC 2
1 the manner in which a document may be signed or delivered:
2 (A) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the Kansas
3 revised limited liability company act or the operating agreement may be
4 provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission is the
5 equivalent of a written document.
6 (B) Whenever the Kansas revised limited liability company act or the
7 operating agreement requires or permits a signature, the signature may be
8 a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. "Electronic
9 signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or
10 logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person
11 with an intent to execute, authenticate or adopt the document. A person
12 may execute a document with such person's signature.
13 (C) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or agreed
14 between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is delivered to
15 a person for purposes of the Kansas revised limited liability company act
16 and the operating agreement when it enters an information processing
17 system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving
18 electronic transmissions of the type delivered if the electronic transmission
19 is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is
20 able to retrieve the electronic transmission. Whether a person has so
21 designated an information processing system is determined by the
22 operating agreement or from the context and surrounding circumstances,
23 including the parties' conduct. An electronic transmission is delivered
24 under this section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an
25 electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system
26 establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does
27 not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
28 (2) The Kansas revised limited liability company act shall not
29 prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance
30 with the uniform electronic transactions act, K.S.A. 16-601 et seq., and
31 amendments thereto, if the part or parts of the transaction that are
32 governed by the Kansas revised limited liability company act are
33 documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this subsection or
34 otherwise in accordance with the Kansas revised limited liability company
35 act. This subsection shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether
36 an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been
37 signed and delivered, in accordance with the Kansas revised limited
38 liability company act and the operating agreement.
39 (b) (1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to:
40 (A) A document filed with or submitted to the secretary of state or a
41 court or other judicial or governmental body of this state;
42 (B) a certificate of limited liability company interest, except that a
43 signature on a certificate of limited liability company interest may be
HB 2371—Am. by SC 3
1 manual, facsimile or electronic signature; and
2 (C) an act or transaction effected pursuant to article 79 of chapter 17
3 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A. 17-
4 7667, 17-76,130, 17-76,131, 17-76,132 and 17-76,133, and amendments
5 thereto.
6 (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not create any presumption
7 about the lawful means to document a matter addressed by this subsection
8 or the lawful means to sign or deliver a document addressed by this
9 subsection. A provision of the operating agreement shall not limit the
10 application of subsection (a) unless the provision expressly restricts one or
11 more of the means of documenting an act or transaction, or of signing or
12 delivering a document, permitted by subsection (a).
13 (c) In the event that any provision of the Kansas revised limited
14 liability company act is deemed to modify, limit or supersede the federal
15 electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. §
16 7001 et. seq., the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
17 company act shall control to the fullest extent permitted by 15 U.S.C. §
18 7002(a)(2).
19 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
20 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
21 New Sec. 2. (a) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a
22 subscription for a limited liability company interest, whether submitted in
23 writing, by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
24 applicable law, is irrevocable if the subscription states that such
25 subscription is irrevocable to the extent provided by the terms of the
26 subscription.
27 (b) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
28 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.

35 ratified, or the failure to comply with any requirements of the operating
36 agreement making such act or transaction void or voidable may be
37 waived, by the members, managers or other persons whose approval
38 would be required under the operating agreement (i) for such act or
39 transaction to be validly taken, or (ii) to amend the operating agreement
40 in a manner that would permit such act or transaction to be validly taken,
41 in each case at the time of such ratification or waiver.
42 (B) If the void or voidable act or transaction was the issuance or
43 assignment of any limited liability company interests, the limited liability
HB 2371—Am. by SC 9
1 company interests purportedly issued or assigned shall be deemed not to
2 have been issued or assigned for purposes of determining whether the void
3 or voidable act or transaction was ratified or waived pursuant to this
4 subsection.
5 (2) Any act or transaction that is ratified, or with respect to which the
6 failure to comply with any requirements of the operating agreement is
7 waived, pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed validly taken at the
8 time of such act or transaction.
9 (3) If an amendment to the operating agreement to permit any such
10 act or transaction to be validly taken would require notice to any
11 members, managers or other persons under the operating agreement and
12 the ratification or waiver of such act or transaction is effectuated pursuant
13 to this subsection by the members, managers or other persons whose
14 approval would be required to amend the operating agreement, notice of
15 such ratification or waiver shall be given following such ratification or
16 waiver to the members, managers or other persons who would have been
17 entitled to notice of such an amendment and who have not otherwise
18 received notice of, or participated in, such ratification or waiver.
19 (4) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit
20 the accomplishment of a ratification or waiver of a void or voidable act by
21 other means permitted by law.
22 (5) Upon application of the limited liability company, any member,
23 manager or person claiming to be substantially and adversely affected by
24 a ratification or waiver pursuant to this subsection, excluding any harm
25 that would have resulted if such act or transaction had been valid when
26 taken, the district court may hear and determine the validity and
27 effectiveness of the ratification of, or waiver with respect to, any void or
28 voidable act or transaction effectuated pursuant to this subsection. In any
29 such application, the limited liability company shall be named as a party
30 and service of the application upon the resident agent of the limited
31 liability company shall be deemed to be service upon the limited liability
32 company, and no other party need be joined in order for the court to
33 adjudicate the validity and effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The
34 court may make such order respecting further or other notice of such
35 application as it deems proper under these circumstances. Nothing in this
36 paragraph limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner
37 now or hereafter provided by law, and this provision is an extension of and
38 not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal
39 process upon nonresidents.

5 as a plaintiff in an action to determine that the plaintiff is a member of a
6 limited liability company or in defense of any threatened, pending or
7 completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

10 company, or is or was serving at the request of the limited liability
11 company as a member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of
12 another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture,
13 trust or other enterprise, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,

6 members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by
7 members who own more than 50% of the then current percentage or other
8 interest in the profits of the domestic limited liability company owned by
9 all of the members or by the members in each class or group, as

13 that is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be exchanged
14 for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in,
15 the surviving or resulting limited liability company or, in addition to or in
16 lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights
17 or securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102,
18 and amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting limited
19 liability company in the merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding,
20 or may be canceled.
21 (3) Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, an agreement of
22 merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a
23 provision for such termination or amendment contained in the agreement
24 of merger or consolidation.
25 (b) The limited liability company surviving or resulting in or from the
26 merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation
27 executed by one or more authorized persons on behalf of the domestic
28 limited liability company when it is the surviving or resulting entity with

19 (c) A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate of
20 cancellation for a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
21 surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or
22 consolidation. A certificate of merger that sets forth any amendment in
23 accordance with subsection (b)(4) shall be deemed to be an amendment to
24 the articles of organization of the limited liability company, and the limited
25 liability company shall not be required to take any further action to amend
26 its articles of organization under K.S.A. 17-7674 or 17-7680, and
27 amendments thereto, with respect to such amendments set forth in the

36 accordance with subsection (a) may:
37 (1)(A) Effect any amendment to the operating agreement; or
38 (2)(B) effect the adoption of a new operating agreement, for a limited
39 liability company if it is the surviving or resulting limited liability
40 company in the merger or consolidation.

42 operating agreement made pursuant to the foregoing sentence paragraph
43 (1) shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
HB 2371—Am. by SC 13
1 consolidation and shall be effective notwithstanding any provision of the

3 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
4 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
5 agreement, in either case, in connection with a merger or consolidation.
6 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the
7 accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by
8 any other means provided for in an operating agreement or other
9 agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the operating
10 agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or
11 consolidation, including a limited liability company formed for the
12 purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the operating
13 agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company.
14 (e) When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective
15 under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of
16 the rights, privileges and powers of each of the limited liability companies
17 that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and
18 mixed, and all debts due to any of the limited liability companies, as well
19 as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such limited
20 liability companies, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting limited
21 liability company, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or
22 resulting limited liability company as they were of each of the limited
23 liability companies that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any
24 real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state of
25 Kansas, in any of such limited liability companies, shall not revert or be in
26 any way impaired by reason of this act, but all rights of creditors and all
27 liens upon any property of any of the limited liability companies shall be
28 preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the
29 limited liability companies that have merged or consolidated shall
30 thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting limited liability company,
31 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities
32 and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed,
33 a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company,
34 including a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
35 surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not
36 require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs
37 under K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and
38 distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and
39 the merger or consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such
40 limited liability company.

42 any other entity in accordance with the business entity transactions act,
43 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto.

13 company is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation, any division
14 of the limited liability company, or the sale of all or substantially all of the
15 limited liability company's assets. The district court shall have jurisdiction
16 to hear and determine any matter relating to any such appraisal rights
17 provided in an operating agreement or an agreement of merger or
18 consolidation or a plan of division.
19 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 17-7685a is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-

HB 2371—Am. by SC 15
1 limited liability company in accordance with this section and, if
2 applicable, the resulting cessation of the existence of the dividing company
3 pursuant to a certificate of division shall not be deemed to affect the
4 personal liability of any person incurred prior to such division with respect
5 to matters arising prior to such division, nor shall it be deemed to affect the
6 validity or enforceability of any obligations or liabilities of the dividing
7 company incurred prior to such division;, except that such the obligations
8 and liabilities of the dividing company shall be allocated to and vested in,

37 assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and the division
38 shall not constitute a dissolution of such limited liability company.
39 (e) In connection with a division under this section, rights or
40 securities of, or interests in, the dividing company may be exchanged for
41 or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the

2 certificate of division, a certificate of amendment of certificate of division
3 is effective at the time of its filing with the secretary of state.
4 (7) Subject to the Kansas revised limited liability company act, the

21 section.
22 (l) Upon the division of a domestic limited liability company
23 becoming effective:
24 (1) The dividing company shall be subdivided divided into the
25 distinct and independent resulting division companies named in the plan of
26 division, and, if the dividing company is not a surviving company, the
27 existence of the dividing company shall cease.
28 (2) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of the

32 shall without further action be allocated to and vested in the applicable
33 division company in such a manner and basis and with such effect as is
34 specified in the plan of division, and the title to any real property or
35 interest therein allocated to and vested in any division company shall not
36 revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the division.
37 (3) Each division company shall, from and after effectiveness of the
38 certificate of division, be liable as a separate and distinct domestic limited
39 liability company for such debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing
40 company as are allocated to such division company pursuant to the plan of
41 division in the manner and on the basis provided in subsection (g)(1)(B).

1 duties of such division company as is specified in the plan of division as
2 having such debts, liabilities and duties allocated to it, in such a manner
3 and basis and with such effect as is specified in the plan of division, and no

5 division does not constitute a fraudulent transfer under applicable law, and
6 all liens upon any property of the dividing company shall be preserved
7 unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company
8 shall remain attached to the division company to which such debts,
9 liabilities and duties have been allocated in the plan of division, and may
10 be enforced against such division company to the same extent as if such
11 debts, liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it
12 in its capacity as a domestic limited liability company.
13 (5) In the event that any allocation of assets, debts, liabilities and
14 duties to division companies in accordance with a plan of division is
15 determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute a fraudulent
16 transfer, each division company shall be jointly and severally liable on
17 account of such fraudulent transfer notwithstanding the allocations made
18 in the plan of division, except that the validity and effectiveness of the
19 division are not otherwise affected thereby.
20 (6) Debts and liabilities of the dividing company that are not
21 allocated by the plan of division shall be the joint and several debts and
22 liabilities of all of the division companies.
23 (7) It shall not be necessary for a plan of division to list each
24 individual asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty of the
25 dividing company to be allocated to a division company so long as the
26 assets, property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties so allocated are
27 reasonably identified by any method where the identity of such assets,

29 determinable.

32 as the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company that have been
33 allocated to such division company pursuant to a plan of division, shall
34 remain vested in each such division company and shall not be deemed, as
35 a result of the division, to have been assigned or transferred to such
36 division company for any purpose of the laws of the state of Kansas.
37 (9) Any action or proceeding pending against a dividing company
38 may be continued against the surviving company, if any, as if the division
39 did not occur, but subject to paragraph (4), and against any resulting
40 company to which the asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty
41 associated with such action or proceeding was allocated pursuant to the
42 plan of division by adding or substituting such resulting company as a
43 party in the action or proceeding.

15 the dividing company with or into another party, or the transfer of assets
16 by the dividing company to another party, then such restriction, condition
17 or prohibition shall be deemed to apply to a division as if it were a merger,

41 Sec. 11. K.S.A. 17-7687 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
42 7687. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
43 members having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
HB 2371—Am. by SC 23
1 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
2 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
3 groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
4 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
5 senior to existing classes and groups of members. An operating agreement

7 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any member
8 or class or group of members, including an action to create under the
9 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability

17 financial interest, class, group or any other basis.
18 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
19 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
20 voted on by any members, waiver of any such notice, action by consent or
21 approval without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum
22 requirements, voting in person or by proxy, or any other matter with

24 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
25 members may be held by means of conference telephone or other
26 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
27 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
28 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
29 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
30 voted on, consented to or approved by members, the members may take
31 such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if
32 consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or by any
33 other means permitted by law, by members having not less than the
34 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
35 such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon
36 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
37 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a member, consents to or
38 approves as a member any matter and provides that such consent or
39 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
40 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
41 consented or approved as a member at such future time so long as such
42 person is then a member. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
43 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by members, the members

2 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
3 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
4 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a member or
5 by a person or persons authorized to act for a member shall be deemed to
6 be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of this
7 subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
8 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,

15 Kansas revised limited liability company act, every member holding an
16 interest in profits shall be entitled to vote.
17 (f) If an operating agreement provides for the manner in which it may
18 be amended, including by requiring the approval or consent of a person
19 who is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction of
20 conditions, it may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise
21 permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
22 amendments thereto, provided that the approval or consent of any person
23 may be waived by such person and that any such conditions may be
24 waived by all persons for whose benefit such conditions were intended.
25 Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a supermajority
26 amendment provision shall only apply to provisions of the operating
27 agreement that are expressly included in the operating agreement. As used
28 in this section, "supermajority amendment provision" means any
29 amendment provision set forth in an operating agreement requiring that an
30 amendment to a provision of the operating agreement be adopted by no
31 less than the vote or consent or approval required to take action under such
32 latter provision.
33 (g) If an operating agreement does not provide for the manner in
34 which it may be amended, the operating agreement may be amended with
35 the approval or consent of all of the members or as otherwise permitted by
36 law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and amendments
37 thereto. This subsection shall only apply to a limited liability company

31 the disclosure of which the manager in good faith believes is not in the
32 best interest of the limited liability company or could damage the limited
33 liability company or its business or which the limited liability company is
34 required by law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
35 (d) A limited liability company may maintain its books, records and
36 other documents in other than a written paper form, including on, by
37 means of, or in the form of any information storage device, method, or one
38 or more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
39 distributed electronic networks or databases, if such form is capable of
40 conversion into written paper form within a reasonable time.
41 (e) Any demand under this section shall be in writing and shall state
42 the purpose of such demand. In every instance where an attorney or other
43 agent is the person who seeks the right to obtain the information described
HB 2371—Am. by SC 26
1 in subsection (a), the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
2 or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act
3 on behalf of the member.
4 (f) Any action to enforce any right arising under this section shall be
5 brought in the district court. If the limited liability company refuses to
6 permit a member, or attorney or other agent acting for the member, to
7 obtain or a manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)
8 or does not reply to the demand that has been made within five business
9 days, or such shorter or longer period of time as is provided for in an
10 operating agreement, but not longer than 30 business days, after the
11 demand has been made, the demanding member or manager may apply to
12 the district court for an order to compel such disclosure. The district court
13 may summarily order the limited liability company to permit the
14 demanding member to obtain or manager to examine the information
15 described in subsection (a) and to make copies or abstracts therefrom, or
16 the district court may summarily order the limited liability company to
17 furnish to the demanding member or manager the information described in
18 subsection (a) on the condition that the demanding member or manager
19 first pay to the limited liability company the reasonable cost of obtaining
20 and furnishing such information and on such other conditions as the
21 district court deems appropriate. When a demanding member seeks to
22 obtain or a manager seeks to examine the information described in
23 subsection (a), the demanding member or manager shall first establish: (1)
24 That the demanding member or manager has complied with the provisions
25 of this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for
26 obtaining or examining of such information; and (2) that the information
27 the demanding member or manager seeks is reasonably related to the
28 member's interest as a member or the manager's position as a manager, as
29 the case may be. The district court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
30 limitations or conditions with reference to the obtaining or examining of
31 information, or award such other or further relief as the district court may
32 deem just and proper. The district court may order books, documents and

37 (g) If a member is entitled to obtain information under the Kansas
38 revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement for a

42 member or manager to obtain or examine information as provided in this
43 section may be expanded or restricted in an original operating agreement
HB 2371—Am. by SC 27
1 or in any subsequent amendment consented to, approved or adopted by all
2 of the members or in compliance with any applicable requirements of the
3 operating agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not be

17 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
18 senior to existing classes and groups of managers. An operating agreement
19 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the

28 interest, class, group or any other basis. Unless otherwise provided in an
29 operating agreement, if more than one manager is appointed, all managers
30 shall have an equal vote per capita.
31 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
32 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
33 voted on by any manager or class or group of managers, waiver of any
34 such notice, action by consent or approval without a meeting, the
35 establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or
36 by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right
37 to vote.
38 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
39 managers may be held by means of conference telephone or other
40 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
41 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
42 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
43 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be

2 take such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
3 vote, if consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or
4 by any other means permitted by law, by managers having not less than the
5 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
6 such action at a meeting at which all managers entitled to vote thereon
7 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
8 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a manager, consents to or
9 approves as a manager any matter and provides that such consent or
10 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
11 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
12 consented or approved as a manager at such future time, so long as such
13 person is then a manager. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
14 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers
15 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,

21 this subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
22 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,

26 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
27 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
28 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 17-7698 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
29 7698. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member or
30 manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority to
31 delegate to one or more other persons any or all of the member's or
32 manager's, as the case may be, rights, powers and duties to manage and
33 control the business and affairs of the limited liability company. Any such
34 delegation may be made irrespective of whether the member or manager
35 has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter as to which its rights,
36 powers or duties are being delegated, and the person or persons to whom
37 any such rights, powers or duties are being delegated shall not be deemed
38 conflicted solely by reason of the conflict of interest of the member or
39 manager. Any such delegation may be to agents, officers and employees
40 of a member or manager or the limited liability company, and by a
41 management agreement or another agreement with, or otherwise to, other
42 persons, including a committee of one or more persons. Unless otherwise
43 provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a member or
HB 2371—Am. by SC 29
1 manager shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable. Unless
2 otherwise provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a
3 member or manager of a limited liability company shall not cause the
4 member or manager to cease to be a member or manager, as the case may
5 be, of the limited liability company or cause the person to whom any such
6 rights, powers and duties have been delegated to be a member or manager,
7 as the case may be, of the limited liability company. No other provision of
8 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or other law shall be
9 construed to restrict a member's or manager's power and authority to
10 delegate any or all of its rights, powers, and duties to manage and control
11 the business and affairs of the limited liability company.

3 certificate of reinstatement of a corporation's articles of incorporation.
4 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 17-76,143 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
5 76,143. (a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the
6 establishment of one or more designated series of members, managers,
7 limited liability company interests or assets. If an operating agreement so
8 provides for the establishment or formation of one or more series, then a
9 series may be formed by complying with this section. Any such series may
10 have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or
11 obligations of the limited liability company or profits and losses associated
12 with specified property or obligations, and to the extent provided in the
13 operating agreement, any such series may have a separate business
14 purpose or investment objective. A series is formed by the filing of a
15 certificate of designation in the office of the secretary of state. Other than
16 pursuant to K.S.A. 17-76,143a, and amendments thereto, a series may not
17 merge, convert, or consolidate pursuant to any section of the Kansas
18 revised limited liability company act, the business entity transactions act,
19 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto, or any other statute of
20 this state.
21 (b) Notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in
22 subsection (c) shall be set forth in the articles of organization of the limited
23 liability company. Notice in articles of organization of the limitation on
24 liabilities of a series as referenced in subsection (c) shall be sufficient for
25 all purposes of this subsection whether or not the limited liability company
26 has formed any series when such notice is included in the articles of
27 organization, and there shall be no requirement that any specific series of
28 the limited liability company be referenced in such notice. The fact that
29 articles of organization that contain the foregoing notice of the limitation
30 on liabilities of a series is on file in the office of the secretary of state shall
31 constitute notice of such limitation on liabilities of a series.
32 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Kansas
33 revised limited liability company act or under other applicable law, in the
34 event that an operating agreement establishes or provides for the
35 establishment of one or more series, and if to the extent the records
36 maintained for any series account for the assets associated with such series
37 separately from the other assets of the limited liability company, or any
38 other series thereof, and if the operating agreement so provides, and if
39 notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this
40 subsection is set forth in the articles of organization of the limited liability
41 company and if the limited liability company has filed a certificate of
42 designation for each series which that is to have limited liability under this
43 section, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred,
HB 2371—Am. by SC 31
1 contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such series shall be
2 enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets
3 of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, and,
4 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, none of the debts,
5 liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise
6 existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any
7 other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.
8 Neither the preceding sentences nor any provision pursuant thereto in an
9 operating agreement, articles of organization or certificate of designation
10 shall: Restrict a series or limited liability company on behalf of a series
11 from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of
12 the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
13 otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally
14 or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such
15 series; or restrict a limited liability company from agreeing in the
16 operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, liabilities,
17 obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing
18 with respect to a series shall be enforceable against the assets of the
19 limited liability company generally. Assets associated with a series may be
20 held directly or indirectly, including in the name of such series, in the
21 name of the limited liability company, through a nominee or otherwise.
22 Records maintained for a series that reasonably identify its assets,
23 including by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational, or
24 allocational formula or procedure, including a percentage or share of any
25 asset or assets, or by any other method where the identity of such assets is
26 objectively determinable, will be deemed to account for the assets
27 associated with such series separately from the other assets of the limited
28 liability company, or any other series thereof. As used in the Kansas
29 revised limited liability company act, a reference to assets of a series
30 includes assets associated with such series, a reference to assets associated
31 with a series includes assets of such series, a reference to members or
32 managers of a series includes members or managers associated with such
33 series, and a reference to members or managers associated with a series
34 includes members or managers of such series. The following shall apply to
35 a series:
36 (1) A series may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity,
37 whether or not for profit, with the exception of the business of granting
38 policies of insurance, assuming insurance risks, or banking as defined in
39 K.S.A. 9-702, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise provided in an
40 operating agreement, a series shall have the power and capacity to, in its
41 own name, contract, hold title to assets, including real, personal, and
42 intangible property, grant liens and security interests, and sue and be sued
43 and otherwise conduct business and exercise the power of a limited
HB 2371—Am. by SC 32
1 liability company under this article. The limited liability company and
2 any of its series may elect to consolidate its operations as a single
3 taxpayer to the extent required to file consolidated tax returns as
4 permitted under applicable law and elect to be treated as a single
5 business for the purposes of qualification or authorization to do
6 business in this or any other state. Such elections shall not affect the
7 limitation of liability set forth in this section except to the extent that
8 the series have specifically accepted joint liability by contract.
9 (2) Except as otherwise provided by the Kansas revised limited
10 liability company act, no member or manager of a series shall be obligated
11 personally for any debt, obligation or liability of such series, whether
12 arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member
13 or acting as manager of such series. Notwithstanding the preceding
14 sentence, under an operating agreement or under another agreement, a
15 member or manager may agree to be obligated personally for any or all of
16 the debts, obligations and liabilities of one or more series.
17 (3) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
18 members or managers associated with a series having such relative rights,
19 powers and duties as the operating agreement may provide, and may make
20 provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the operating
21 agreement of additional classes or groups of members or managers
22 associated with such series having such relative rights, powers and duties
23 as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and
24 duties senior to existing classes and groups of members or managers
25 associated with such series. An operating agreement may provide for the
26 taking of an action, including the amendment of the operating agreement,
27 without the vote, consent or approval of any member or manager or class
28 or group of members or managers, including an action to create under the
29 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of a series of
30 limited liability company interests that was not previously outstanding. An
31 operating agreement may provide that any member or class or group of
32 members associated with a series shall have no voting rights or ability to
33 otherwise participate in the management or governance of such series,
34 but any such member or class or group of members are owners of the
35 series.
36 (4) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
37 members or managers or a specified class or group of the members or
38 managers associated with a series the right to vote separately or with all or
39 any class or group of the members or managers associated with such
40 series, on any matter. Voting by members or managers associated with a
41 series may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or
42 any other basis.
43 (5) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the
HB 2371—Am. by SC 33
1 management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with
2 such series in proportion to the then-current percentage or other interest of
3 members in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
4 associated with such series, the decision of members owning more than
5 50% of such percentage or other interest in the profits controlling, except
6 that if an operating agreement provides for the management of a series, in
7 whole or in part, by a manager or managers, the management of such
8 series, to the extent so provided, shall be vested in the manager or
9 managers who shall be chosen in the manner provided in the operating
10 agreement. The manager of a series shall also hold the offices and have the
11 responsibilities accorded to the manager as set forth in an operating
12 agreement. A series may have more than one manager. Subject to K.S.A.
13 17-76,105, and amendments thereto, a manager shall cease to be a
14 manager with respect to a series as provided in an operating agreement.
15 Except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event under
16 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or in an operating
17 agreement that causes a manager to cease to be a manager with respect to a
18 series shall not, in itself, cause such manager to cease to be a manager of
19 the limited liability company or with respect to any other series thereof.
20 (6) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,109, and amendments thereto, but
21 subject to subsections (c)(7) and (c)(10), and unless otherwise provided in
22 an operating agreement, at the time a member of a series becomes entitled
23 to receive a distribution with respect to such series, the member has the
24 status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of such
25 series, with respect to the distribution. An operating agreement may
26 provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations
27 and distributions with respect to a series.
28 (7) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,110(a), and amendments thereto, a
29 limited liability company may make a distribution with respect to a series.
30 A limited liability company shall not make a distribution with respect to a
31 series to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after
32 giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of such series, other than
33 liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company
34 interests with respect to such series and liabilities for which the recourse of
35 creditors is limited to specified property of such series, exceed the fair
36 value of the assets associated with such series, except that the fair value of
37 property of such series that is subject to a liability for which the recourse
38 of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets associated with such
39 series only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that
40 liability. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
41 "distribution" shall not include amounts constituting reasonable
42 compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in
43 the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or
HB 2371—Am. by SC 34
1 other benefits program. A member who receives a distribution in violation
2 of this subsection, and who knew at the time of the distribution that the
3 distribution violated this subsection, shall be liable to the series for the
4 amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in
5 violation of this subsection, and who did not know at the time of the
6 distribution that the distribution violated this subsection, shall not be liable
7 for the amount of the distribution. Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,110(c), and
8 amendments thereto, which shall apply to any distribution made with
9 respect to a series under this subsection, this subsection shall not affect any
10 obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable
11 law for the amount of a distribution.
12 (8) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member
13 shall cease to be associated with a series and to have the power to exercise
14 any rights or powers of a member with respect to such series upon the
15 assignment of all of the member's limited liability company interest with
16 respect to such series. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
17 agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability company
18 act or an operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be
19 associated with a series shall not, in itself, cause such member to cease to
20 be associated with any other series or terminate the continued membership
21 of a member in the limited liability company or cause the dissolution of
22 the series, regardless of whether such member was the last remaining
23 member associated with such series.
24 (9) Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments thereto, except to
25 the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series may be
26 dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the
27 limited liability company. The dissolution of a series shall not affect the
28 limitation on liabilities of such series provided by this subsection (c). A
29 series is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the dissolution of
30 the limited liability company under K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments
31 thereto, or otherwise upon the first to occur of the following:
32 (A) At the time specified in the operating agreement;
33 (B) upon the happening of events specified in the operating
34 agreement;
35 (C) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, upon the
36 vote, consent or approval of members associated with such series who own
37 2/ or more of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of
3
38 such series of the limited liability company owned by all of the members
39 associated with such series; or
40 (D) the dissolution of such series under subsection (c)(11).
41 (10) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,118(a), and amendments thereto,
42 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a manager
43 associated with a series who has not wrongfully dissolved such series or, if
HB 2371—Am. by SC 35
1 none, the members associated with such series or a person consented to or
2 approved by the members associated with such series, in either case, by
3 members who own more than 50% of the then-current percentage or other
4 interest in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
5 associated with such series, may wind up the affairs of such series, but the
6 district court, upon cause shown, may wind up the affairs of a series upon
7 application of any member or manager associated with such series, or the
8 member's personal representative or assignee, and in connection therewith,
9 may appoint a liquidating trustee. The persons winding up the affairs of a
10 series may, in the name of the limited liability company and for and on
11 behalf of the limited liability company and such series, take all actions
12 with respect to such series as are permitted under K.S.A. 17-76,118(b), and
13 amendments thereto. The persons winding up the affairs of a series shall
14 provide for the claims and obligations of such series and distribute the
15 assets of such series as provided in K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments
16 thereto, which section shall apply to the winding up and distribution of
17 assets of a series. Actions taken in accordance with this subsection shall
18 not affect the liability of members and shall not impose liability on a
19 liquidating trustee.
20 (11) On application by or for a member or manager associated with a
21 series, the district court may decree dissolution of such series whenever it
22 is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of such series in
23 conformity with an operating agreement.
24 (12) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a series is an
25 association, regardless of the number of members or managers, if any, of
26 such series.
27 (d) In order to form a series of a limited liability company, a
28 certificate of designation must be filed in accordance with this subsection.
29 (1) (A) A certificate of designation shall set forth:
30 (i) The name of the limited liability company; and
31 (ii) the name of the series.
32 (B) A certificate of designation may include any other matter that the

42 (3) A certificate of designation may be amended by filing a certificate
43 of amendment thereto in the office of the secretary of state.
HB 2371—Am. by SC 36

17 thereto.
18 Sec. 17. K.S.A. 17-76,143a is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
19 76,143a. (a) Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, one or
20 more series may merge or consolidate with or into one or more other series
21 of the same limited liability company with such series as the agreement
22 shall provide being the surviving or resulting series. Unless otherwise
23 provided in the operating agreement, an agreement of merger or
24 consolidation shall be consented to or approved by each series that is to
25 merge or consolidate by members of such series who own more than 50%
26 of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of such series
27 owned by all of the members of such series. In connection with a merger
28 or consolidation hereunder, rights or securities of, or interests in, a series
29 which that is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be
30 exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights, or securities of, or
31 interests in, the surviving or resulting series or, in addition to or in lieu
32 thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights, or
33 securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102, and
34 amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting series in the
35 merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding or may be canceled.
36 Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, an agreement of merger or
37 consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for
38 such termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or
39 consolidation.
40 (b) If a series is merging or consolidating under this section, the
41 series surviving or resulting in or from the merger or consolidation shall
42 file a certificate of merger or consolidation of series executed by one or
43 more authorized persons on behalf of the series when it is the surviving or
HB 2371—Am. by SC 40
1 resulting series in the office of the secretary of state. The certificate of
2 merger or consolidation of series shall state:
3 (1) The name of each series that is to merge or consolidate and the
4 name of the limited liability company that formed such series;
5 (2) that an agreement of merger or consolidation has been consented
6 to or approved and executed by or on behalf of each series that is to merge
7 or consolidate;
8 (3) the name of the surviving or resulting series;
9 (4) such amendment amendments, if any, to the certificate of
10 designation of the series that is the surviving or resulting series to change
11 the name of the surviving series, as is are desired to be effected by the
12 merger, and such amendments may amend and restate the certificate of
13 designation of the surviving series in its enirety;
14 (5) the future effective date or time, which shall be a date or time
15 certain, of the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the
16 filing of the certificate of merger or consolidation;
17 (6) that the agreement of merger or consolidation is on file at a place
18 of business of the surviving or resulting series or the limited liability
19 company that formed such series and shall state the address thereof; and
20 (7) that a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be
21 furnished by the surviving or resulting series, upon request and without
22 cost, to any member of any series that is to merge or consolidate.
23 (c) Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate of
24 merger or consolidation, a merger or consolidation of series pursuant to
25 this section shall be effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger or
26 consolidation of series in the office of the secretary of state.
27 (d) A certificate of merger or consolidation of series shall act as a
28 certificate of cancellation of the certificate of designation of the series that
29 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation. A
30 certificate of merger or consolidation of series that sets forth any
31 amendment in accordance with subsection (b)(4) shall be deemed to be an
32 amendment to the certificate of designation of the surviving or resulting
33 series, and no further action shall be required to amend the certificate of
34 designation of the surviving or resulting series under K.S.A. 17-76,143,
35 and amendments thereto, with respect to such amendments set forth in the
36 such certificate of merger or consolidation of series. Whenever this section
37 requires the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation of series, such
38 requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of
39 merger or consolidation containing the information required by this section
40 to be set forth in the such certificate of merger or consolidation.
41 (e) An agreement of merger or consolidation consented to or
42 approved in accordance with subsection (a) may effect any amendment to
43 the operating agreement relating solely to the series that are constituent
HB 2371—Am. by SC 41
1 parties to the merger or consolidation. Any amendment to an operating
2 agreement relating solely to the series that are constituent parties to the
3 merger or consolidation made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be
4 effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation and
5 shall be effective notwithstanding any provision of the operating
6 agreement relating to amendment of the operating agreement, other than a
7 provision that by its terms applies to an amendment to the operating
8 agreement in connection with a merger or consolidation. The provisions of
9 this subsection shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a
10 merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by any other means
11 provided for in an operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise
12 permitted by law, including that the operating agreement relating to any
13 constituent series to the merger or consolidation, including a series formed
14 for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the
15 operating agreement of the surviving or resulting series.
16 (f) (1) (A) When any merger or consolidation shall have become
17 effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of
18 Kansas, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the series that
19 have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
20 and all debts due to any of such series, as well as all other things and
21 causes of action belonging to each of such series, shall be vested in the
22 surviving or resulting series, and shall thereafter be the property of the
23 surviving or resulting series as they were of each of the series that have
24 merged or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or
25 otherwise, under the laws of the state of Kansas, in any of such series,
26 shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Kansas revised
27 limited liability company act.
28 (B) All rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of
29 the series that have merged or consolidated shall be preserved unimpaired,
30 and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of such series that have merged
31 or consolidated shall thereafter attach to the surviving or resulting series,
32 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts,
33 liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.
34 (2) Unless otherwise agreed, a merger or consolidation of a series that
35 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation, shall
36 not require such series to wind up its affairs under K.S.A. 17-76,143, and
37 amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under
38 K.S.A. 17-76,143, and amendments thereto, and the merger or
39 consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such series.
40 (g) An operating agreement may provide that a series of such limited
41 liability company shall not have the power to merge or consolidate as set
42 forth in this section.
43 (h) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2020.

3 liability company as set forth in its operating agreement are inaccurately
4 set forth in its articles of organization, shall promptly amend the articles
5 of organization. Any provision in the operating agreement or articles of
6 organization of a statutory public benefit limited liability company that is

19 does not contain the term "statutory public benefit limited liability
20 company," or the abbreviation "S.P.B.L.L.C.," or the designation
21 "SPBLLC," or words or abbreviations of like import in other languages if
22 they are written in Roman characters or letters, the statutory public benefit
23 limited liability company shall, prior to issuing any limited liability
24 company interest, provide notice to any person to whom such limited
25 liability company interest is issued that it is a statutory public benefit
26 limited liability company. Such notice need not be provided if the issuance
27 is pursuant to an offering registered under the securities act of 1933, 15

37 materially affected by the limited liability company's conduct, and the

42 limited liability company shall not have any liability for monetary
43 damages for the failure to manage or direct the business and affairs of the
HB 2371—Am. by SC 47
1 statutory public benefit limited liability company as provided in this
2 subsection.
3 (b) A member, manager or other person with authority to manage or
4 direct the business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited
5 liability company shall not, by virtue of the public benefit provisions or

11 implicating the balance requirement in subsection (a), will be deemed to

15 Sec. 23. K.S.A. 17-76,152 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
16 76,152. (a) A statutory public benefit limited liability company, at least

7 statutory public benefit limited liability company or any of its members,
8 managers, affiliates or other persons with authority to manage or direct the
9 business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited liability
10 company.

12 most recent statement described in subsection (a) on the public portion of
13 its website, if any, concurrently with the delivery of such statement to its

15 company does not have a website, it shall provide a copy of such
16 statement, without charge, to any person that requests a copy. Any
17 compensation paid to any person and any other financial or proprietary
18 information contained in the statement described in subsection (a) may be
19 omitted from any statement that is publicly posted or provided to any
20 person pursuant to this subsection, other than a statement provided to a
21 member, manager or other person with authority to manage or direct the
22 business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited liability
23 company.

30
31 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
32 New Section 1. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), without
33 limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be documented or

HB 2371—Am. by SC 2
1 the manner in which a document may be signed or delivered:
2 (A) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the Kansas
3 revised limited liability company act or the operating agreement may be
4 provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission is the
5 equivalent of a written document.
6 (B) Whenever the Kansas revised limited liability company act or the
7 operating agreement requires or permits a signature, the signature may be
8 a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. "Electronic
9 signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or
10 logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person
11 with an intent to execute, authenticate or adopt the document. A person
12 may execute a document with such person's signature.
13 (C) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or agreed
14 between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is delivered to
15 a person for purposes of the Kansas revised limited liability company act
16 and the operating agreement when it enters an information processing
17 system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving
18 electronic transmissions of the type delivered if the electronic transmission
19 is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is
20 able to retrieve the electronic transmission. Whether a person has so
21 designated an information processing system is determined by the
22 operating agreement or from the context and surrounding circumstances,
23 including the parties' conduct. An electronic transmission is delivered
24 under this section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an
25 electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system
26 establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does
27 not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
28 (2) The Kansas revised limited liability company act shall not
29 prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance
30 with the uniform electronic transactions act, K.S.A. 16-601 et seq., and
31 amendments thereto, if the part or parts of the transaction that are
32 governed by the Kansas revised limited liability company act are
33 documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this subsection or
34 otherwise in accordance with the Kansas revised limited liability company
35 act. This subsection shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether
36 an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been
37 signed and delivered, in accordance with the Kansas revised limited
38 liability company act and the operating agreement.
39 (b) (1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to:
40 (A) A document filed with or submitted to the secretary of state or a
41 court or other judicial or governmental body of this state;
42 (B) a certificate of limited liability company interest, except that a
43 signature on a certificate of limited liability company interest may be

HB 2371—Am. by SC 3
1 manual, facsimile or electronic signature; and
2 (C) an act or transaction effected pursuant to article 79 of chapter 17
3 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A. 17-
4 7667, 17-76,130, 17-76,131, 17-76,132 and 17-76,133, and amendments
5 thereto.
6 (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not create any presumption
7 about the lawful means to document a matter addressed by this subsection
8 or the lawful means to sign or deliver a document addressed by this
9 subsection. A provision of the operating agreement shall not limit the
10 application of subsection (a) unless the provision expressly restricts one or
11 more of the means of documenting an act or transaction, or of signing or
12 delivering a document, permitted by subsection (a).
13 (c) In the event that any provision of the Kansas revised limited
14 liability company act is deemed to modify, limit or supersede the federal
15 electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. §
16 7001 et. seq., the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
17 company act shall control to the fullest extent permitted by 15 U.S.C. §
18 7002(a)(2).
19 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
20 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
21 New Sec. 2. (a) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a
22 subscription for a limited liability company interest, whether submitted in
23 writing, by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
24 applicable law, is irrevocable if the subscription states that such
25 subscription is irrevocable to the extent provided by the terms of the
26 subscription.
27 (b) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
28 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
29 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 17-7662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
30 7662. K.S.A. 17-7662 through 17-76,142, and amendments thereto, and
31 K.S.A. 17-76,143 through 17-76,146, 17-7676a, 17-7685a, 17-76,143a and
32 17-76,147 through 17-76,155, and amendments thereto, and sections 1
33 and 2, and amendments thereto, shall be known and may be cited as the
34 Kansas revised limited liability company act.
35 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 17-7663 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
36 7663. As used in the Kansas revised limited liability company act unless
37 the context otherwise requires:
38 (a) "Articles of organization" means the articles of organization
39 referred to in K.S.A. 17-7673, and amendments thereto, and the articles of
40 organization as amended.
41 (b) "Bankruptcy" means an event that causes a person to cease to be a
42 member as provided in K.S.A. 17-7689, and amendments thereto.
43 (c) "Contribution" means any cash, property, services rendered or a

HB 2371—Am. by SC 4
1 promissory note or other obligation to contribute cash or property or to

9 (3) If an amendment to the operating agreement to permit any such
10 act or transaction to be validly taken would require notice to any
11 members, managers or other persons under the operating agreement and
12 the ratification or waiver of such act or transaction is effectuated pursuant
13 to this subsection by the members, managers or other persons whose
14 approval would be required to amend the operating agreement, notice of
15 such ratification or waiver shall be given following such ratification or

27 effectiveness of the ratification of, or waiver with respect to, any void or
28 voidable act or transaction effectuated pursuant to this subsection. In any
29 such application, the limited liability company shall be named as a party
30 and service of the application upon the resident agent of the limited
31 liability company shall be deemed to be service upon the limited liability
32 company, and no other party need be joined in order for the court to
33 adjudicate the validity and effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The
34 court may make such order respecting further or other notice of such
35 application as it deems proper under these circumstances. Nothing in this
36 paragraph limits or affects the right to serve process in any other manner
37 now or hereafter provided by law, and this provision is an extension of and
38 not a limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal
39 process upon nonresidents.

3 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
4 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
5 agreement, in either case, in connection with a merger or consolidation.
6 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the
7 accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by
8 any other means provided for in an operating agreement or other
9 agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the operating
10 agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or
11 consolidation, including a limited liability company formed for the
12 purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the operating
13 agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company.

20 liability companies, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting limited
21 liability company, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or
22 resulting limited liability company as they were of each of the limited
23 liability companies that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any
24 real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state of
25 Kansas, in any of such limited liability companies, shall not revert or be in
26 any way impaired by reason of this act, but all rights of creditors and all
27 liens upon any property of any of the limited liability companies shall be
28 preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the
29 limited liability companies that have merged or consolidated shall
30 thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting limited liability company,
31 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities
32 and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed,
33 a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company,
34 including a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
35 surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not
36 require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs
37 under K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and
38 distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and
39 the merger or consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such
40 limited liability company.
41 (f) A limited liability company may merge or consolidate with or into
42 any other entity in accordance with the business entity transactions act,

37 assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and the division
38 shall not constitute a dissolution of such limited liability company.
39 (e) In connection with a division under this section, rights or
40 securities of, or interests in, the dividing company may be exchanged for
41 or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the

43 thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or

5 (A) May effect: (i) Any amendment to the operating agreement of the
6 dividing company if it is a surviving company in the division; or (ii) the
7 adoption of a new operating agreement for the dividing company if it is a
8 surviving company in the division; and
9 (B) shall effect the adoption of a new an operating agreement for

19 company relating to amendment or adoption of a new operating
20 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
21 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
22 agreement, in either case, in connection with a division, merger or
23 consolidation.
24 (g) If a domestic limited liability company is dividing under this

28 (A) Any conversion or exchange of the limited liability company
29 interests of the dividing company into or for limited liability company

32 defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102, and amendments thereto, that is not a
33 division company, or that the limited liability company interests of the

10 company shall file a certificate of division executed by one or more
11 authorized persons on behalf of such division dividing company in the

37 (3) A certificate of division may be amended to change the name or
38 business address of the division contact in a certificate of division or to
39 change information in the certificate of division required by subsection (h)
40 (2)(F). A certificate of division is amended by filing a certificate of

29 certificate of division, each certificate of amendment of certificate of
30 division shall be executed as follows:

32 authorized persons on behalf of the dividing company acting on behalf of
33 the division company to which the certificate of amendment of certificate
34 of division relates; and

42 (6) Unless otherwise provided in the Kansas revised limited liability
43 company act or unless a later effective date or time, which shall be a date

HB 2371—Am. by SC 19

2 certificate of division, a certificate of amendment of certificate of division
3 is effective at the time of its filing with the secretary of state.
4 (7) Subject to the Kansas revised limited liability company act, the
5 secretary of state shall accept the filing of certificates of amendment of
6 certificate of division for all division companies resulting from the same
7 certificates of division if at least one division company is in good standing
8 at the time of such filings.
9 (i) The certificate of division and each articles of organization for
10 each resulting company required by subsection (h) shall be filed
11 simultaneously in the office of the secretary of state and, if such certificate
12 and articles of organization are not to become effective upon their filing,
13 then each such certificate shall provide for the same effective date or time
14 in accordance with K.S.A. 17-7911, and amendments thereto.
15 Concurrently with the effective date or time of a division, the operating
16 agreement of each resulting company shall become effective.

18 a dividing company that is not a surviving company.
19 (k) An operating agreement may provide that a domestic limited
20 liability company shall not have the power to divide as set forth in this
21 section.
22 (l) Upon the division of a domestic limited liability company
23 becoming effective:
24 (1) The dividing company shall be subdivided divided into the
25 distinct and independent resulting division companies named in the plan of
26 division, and, if the dividing company is not a surviving company, the
27 existence of the dividing company shall cease.
28 (2) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of the
29 rights, privileges and powers, and all the property, real, personal, and
30 mixed, of the dividing company and all debts due on whatever account to
31 it, as well as all other things and other causes of action belonging to it,
32 shall without further action be allocated to and vested in the applicable
33 division company in such a manner and basis and with such effect as is
34 specified in the plan of division, and the title to any real property or
35 interest therein allocated to and vested in any division company shall not
36 revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the division.
37 (3) Each division company shall, from and after effectiveness of the
38 certificate of division, be liable as a separate and distinct domestic limited
39 liability company for such debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing
40 company as are allocated to such division company pursuant to the plan of
41 division in the manner and on the basis provided in subsection (g)(1)(B).
42 (4) Each of the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company
43 shall without further action be allocated to and be the debts, liabilities and

HB 2371—Am. by SC 20
1 duties of such division company as is specified in the plan of division as
2 having such debts, liabilities and duties allocated to it, in such a manner
3 and basis and with such effect as is specified in the plan of division, and no
4 other division company shall be liable therefor, so long as the plan of
5 division does not constitute a fraudulent transfer under applicable law, and
6 all liens upon any property of the dividing company shall be preserved
7 unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company
8 shall remain attached to the division company to which such debts,
9 liabilities and duties have been allocated in the plan of division, and may
10 be enforced against such division company to the same extent as if such
11 debts, liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it
12 in its capacity as a domestic limited liability company.
13 (5) In the event that any allocation of assets, debts, liabilities and
14 duties to division companies in accordance with a plan of division is
15 determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute a fraudulent
16 transfer, each division company shall be jointly and severally liable on
17 account of such fraudulent transfer notwithstanding the allocations made
18 in the plan of division, except that the validity and effectiveness of the
19 division are not otherwise affected thereby.
20 (6) Debts and liabilities of the dividing company that are not
21 allocated by the plan of division shall be the joint and several debts and
22 liabilities of all of the division companies.
23 (7) It shall not be necessary for a plan of division to list each
24 individual asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty of the
25 dividing company to be allocated to a division company so long as the
26 assets, property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties so allocated are
27 reasonably identified by any method where the identity of such assets,
28 property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties is objectively
29 determinable.
30 (8) The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the
31 dividing company that have been allocated to a division company, as well
32 as the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company that have been
33 allocated to such division company pursuant to a plan of division, shall
34 remain vested in each such division company and shall not be deemed, as
35 a result of the division, to have been assigned or transferred to such
36 division company for any purpose of the laws of the state of Kansas.
37 (9) Any action or proceeding pending against a dividing company
38 may be continued against the surviving company, if any, as if the division
39 did not occur, but subject to paragraph (4), and against any resulting
40 company to which the asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty
41 associated with such action or proceeding was allocated pursuant to the
42 plan of division by adding or substituting such resulting company as a
43 party in the action or proceeding.

HB 2371—Am. by SC 21
1 (m) In applying the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
2 company act on distributions, a direct or indirect allocation of property or

6 operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by the
7 Kansas revised limited liability company act or as otherwise permitted by

14 conditions or prohibits the consummation of a merger or consolidation by
15 the dividing company with or into another party, or the transfer of assets
16 by the dividing company to another party, then such restriction, condition
17 or prohibition shall be deemed to apply to a division as if it were a merger,
18 consolidation or transfer of assets, as applicable.

41 Sec. 11. K.S.A. 17-7687 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
42 7687. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
43 members having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating

HB 2371—Am. by SC 23
1 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
2 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
3 groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
4 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
5 senior to existing classes and groups of members. An operating agreement
6 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
7 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any member
8 or class or group of members, including an action to create under the
9 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability

13 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
14 members or a specified class or group of the members the right to vote
15 separately or with all or any class or group of the members or managers,
16 on any matter. Voting by members may be on a per capita, number,
17 financial interest, class, group or any other basis.
18 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice

21 approval without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum
22 requirements, voting in person or by proxy, or any other matter with
23 respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.
24 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
25 members may be held by means of conference telephone or other
26 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
27 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
28 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
29 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
30 voted on, consented to or approved by members, the members may take
31 such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if
32 consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or by any
33 other means permitted by law, by members having not less than the
34 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
35 such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon
36 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
37 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a member, consents to or
38 approves as a member any matter and provides that such consent or
39 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
40 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
41 consented or approved as a member at such future time so long as such
42 person is then a member. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
43 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by members, the members

1 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
2 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
3 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
4 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a member or
5 by a person or persons authorized to act for a member shall be deemed to
6 be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of this
7 subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of

13 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
14 (e) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or in the
15 Kansas revised limited liability company act, every member holding an
16 interest in profits shall be entitled to vote.
17 (f) If an operating agreement provides for the manner in which it may
18 be amended, including by requiring the approval or consent of a person
19 who is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction of
20 conditions, it may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise
21 permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
22 amendments thereto, provided that the approval or consent of any person
23 may be waived by such person and that any such conditions may be
24 waived by all persons for whose benefit such conditions were intended.
25 Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a supermajority
26 amendment provision shall only apply to provisions of the operating
27 agreement that are expressly included in the operating agreement. As used
28 in this section, "supermajority amendment provision" means any
29 amendment provision set forth in an operating agreement requiring that an
30 amendment to a provision of the operating agreement be adopted by no
31 less than the vote or consent or approval required to take action under such
32 latter provision.
33 (g) If an operating agreement does not provide for the manner in
34 which it may be amended, the operating agreement may be amended with
35 the approval or consent of all of the members or as otherwise permitted by
36 law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and amendments
37 thereto. This subsection shall only apply to a limited liability company
38 whose original articles of organization were filed with the secretary of
39 state on or after July 1, 2014.
40 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 17-7690 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
41 7690. (a) Each member of a limited liability company, in person or by
42 attorney or other agent, has the right, subject to such reasonable standards,
43 including standards governing what information, including books, records

HB 2371—Am. by SC 25
1 and other documents are, is to be furnished at what time and location and
2 at whose expense, as may be set forth in an operating agreement or
3 otherwise established by the manager or, if there is no manager, then by
4 the members, to obtain from the limited liability company from time to
5 time upon reasonable demand for any purpose reasonably related to the
6 member's interest as a member of the limited liability company:
7 (1) True and full information regarding the status of the business and
8 financial condition of the limited liability company;
9 (2) promptly after becoming available, a copy of the limited liability
10 company's federal, state and local income tax returns for each year;

12 mailing address of each member and manager;
13 (4) a copy of any written operating agreement and articles of
14 organization and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of
15 any written powers of attorney pursuant to which the operating agreement
16 and any certificate and all amendments thereto have been executed;
17 (5) true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
18 description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or
19 services contributed by each member and which each member has agreed
20 to contribute in the future, and the date on which each became a member;
21 and
22 (6) other information regarding the affairs of the limited liability
23 company as is just and reasonable.
24 (b) Each manager shall have the right to examine all of the
25 information described in subsection (a) for a purpose reasonably related to
26 the position of manager.
27 (c) The manager of a limited liability company shall have the right to
28 keep confidential from the members, for such period of time as the
29 manager deems reasonable, any information which that the manager
30 reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information
31 the disclosure of which the manager in good faith believes is not in the
32 best interest of the limited liability company or could damage the limited
33 liability company or its business or which the limited liability company is
34 required by law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
35 (d) A limited liability company may maintain its books, records and
36 other documents in other than a written paper form, including on, by
37 means of, or in the form of any information storage device, method, or one
38 or more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
39 distributed electronic networks or databases, if such form is capable of
40 conversion into written paper form within a reasonable time.
41 (e) Any demand under this section shall be in writing and shall state
42 the purpose of such demand. In every instance where an attorney or other
43 agent is the person who seeks the right to obtain the information described

HB 2371—Am. by SC 26
1 in subsection (a), the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
2 or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act
3 on behalf of the member.
4 (f) Any action to enforce any right arising under this section shall be
5 brought in the district court. If the limited liability company refuses to
6 permit a member, or attorney or other agent acting for the member, to
7 obtain or a manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)
8 or does not reply to the demand that has been made within five business
9 days, or such shorter or longer period of time as is provided for in an
10 operating agreement, but not longer than 30 business days, after the
11 demand has been made, the demanding member or manager may apply to
12 the district court for an order to compel such disclosure. The district court
13 may summarily order the limited liability company to permit the
14 demanding member to obtain or manager to examine the information
15 described in subsection (a) and to make copies or abstracts therefrom, or
16 the district court may summarily order the limited liability company to
17 furnish to the demanding member or manager the information described in
18 subsection (a) on the condition that the demanding member or manager
19 first pay to the limited liability company the reasonable cost of obtaining
20 and furnishing such information and on such other conditions as the
21 district court deems appropriate. When a demanding member seeks to
22 obtain or a manager seeks to examine the information described in
23 subsection (a), the demanding member or manager shall first establish: (1)
24 That the demanding member or manager has complied with the provisions
25 of this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for
26 obtaining or examining of such information; and (2) that the information
27 the demanding member or manager seeks is reasonably related to the
28 member's interest as a member or the manager's position as a manager, as
29 the case may be. The district court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
30 limitations or conditions with reference to the obtaining or examining of
31 information, or award such other or further relief as the district court may
32 deem just and proper. The district court may order books, documents and
33 records and other documents, pertinent extracts therefrom, or duly
34 authenticated copies thereof, to be brought within the state of Kansas and
35 kept in the state of Kansas upon such terms and conditions as the order
36 may prescribe.
37 (g) If a member is entitled to obtain information under the Kansas
38 revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement for a
39 purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member or other
40 stated purpose, the member's right shall be to obtain such information as
41 is necessary and essential to achieving that purpose. The rights of a
42 member or manager to obtain or examine information as provided in this
43 section may be expanded or restricted in an original operating agreement

HB 2371—Am. by SC 27
1 or in any subsequent amendment consented to, approved or adopted by all
2 of the members or in compliance with any applicable requirements of the
3 operating agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
4 construed to limit the ability to impose restrictions on expand or restrict
5 the rights of a member or manager to obtain or examine information by
6 any other means permitted under the Kansas revised limited liability
7 company act by law.
8 (h) A limited liability company shall maintain a current record that
9 identifies the name and last known business, residence, or mailing address
10 of each member and manager.
11 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 17-7695 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
12 7695. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
13 managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
14 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
15 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
16 groups of managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
17 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
18 senior to existing classes and groups of managers. An operating agreement
19 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
20 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any manager
21 or class or group of managers, including an action to create under the
22 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability
23 company interests that was not previously outstanding.
24 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
25 managers or a specified class or group of the managers the right to vote,
26 separately or with all or any class or group of managers or members, on
27 any matter. Voting by managers may be on a per capita, number, financial
28 interest, class, group or any other basis. Unless otherwise provided in an
29 operating agreement, if more than one manager is appointed, all managers
30 shall have an equal vote per capita.
31 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
32 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
33 voted on by any manager or class or group of managers, waiver of any
34 such notice, action by consent or approval without a meeting, the
35 establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or
36 by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right
37 to vote.
38 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
39 managers may be held by means of conference telephone or other
40 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
41 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
42 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
43 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be

HB 2371—Am. by SC 28
1 voted on, consented to or approved by the managers, the managers may
2 take such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
3 vote, if consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or
4 by any other means permitted by law, by managers having not less than the
5 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
6 such action at a meeting at which all managers entitled to vote thereon
7 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
8 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a manager, consents to or
9 approves as a manager any matter and provides that such consent or
10 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
11 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
12 consented or approved as a manager at such future time, so long as such
13 person is then a manager. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
14 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers
15 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
16 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
17 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
18 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a manager
19 or by a person or persons authorized to act for a manager shall be deemed
20 to be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of
21 this subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
22 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
23 including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks
24 or databases, including one or more distributed electronic networks or
25 databases, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and
26 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
27 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
28 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 17-7698 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
29 7698. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member or
30 manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority to
31 delegate to one or more other persons any or all of the member's or
32 manager's, as the case may be, rights, powers and duties to manage and
33 control the business and affairs of the limited liability company. Any such
34 delegation may be made irrespective of whether the member or manager
35 has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter as to which its rights,
36 powers or duties are being delegated, and the person or persons to whom
37 any such rights, powers or duties are being delegated shall not be deemed
38 conflicted solely by reason of the conflict of interest of the member or
39 manager. Any such delegation may be to agents, officers and employees
40 of a member or manager or the limited liability company, and by a
41 management agreement or another agreement with, or otherwise to, other
42 persons, including a committee of one or more persons. Unless otherwise
43 provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a member or

HB 2371—Am. by SC 29
1 manager shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable. Unless
2 otherwise provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a
3 member or manager of a limited liability company shall not cause the
4 member or manager to cease to be a member or manager, as the case may
5 be, of the limited liability company or cause the person to whom any such
6 rights, powers and duties have been delegated to be a member or manager,
7 as the case may be, of the limited liability company. No other provision of
8 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or other law shall be
9 construed to restrict a member's or manager's power and authority to
10 delegate any or all of its rights, powers, and duties to manage and control
11 the business and affairs of the limited liability company.
12 Sec. 15. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 17-76,136 is hereby amended to read as
13 follows: 17-76,136. (a) The secretary of state shall charge each domestic
14 and foreign limited liability company the following fees:
15 (1) A fee of $20 for issuing or filing and indexing any of the
16 following documents:
17 (A) A certificate of amendment of articles of organization;
18 (B) restated articles of organization;
19 (C) a certificate of cancellation, which shall be multiplied by the
20 number of series of the limited liability company named in the certificate
21 of cancellation;
22 (D) a certificate of change of location of registered office or resident
23 agent;
24 (E) a certificate of merger or consolidation;
25 (F) a certificate of division; and
26 (G) any certificate, affidavit, agreement or any other paper provided
27 for in the Kansas revised limited liability company act, for which no
28 different fee is specifically prescribed;
29 (2) a fee of $7.50 for each certified copy, regardless of whether the
30 secretary of state supplies the copy;
31 (3) a fee of $7.50 for each certificate of good standing, including a
32 certificate of good standing for a series of a limited liability company,
33 issued by the secretary of state; and
34 (4) a fee of $20 for a copy of an instrument on file or prepared by the
35 secretary of state's office, whether or not the copy is certified.
36 (b) Every limited liability company hereafter formed in this state shall
37 pay to the secretary of state, at the time of filing its articles of organization,
38 an application and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of
39 the secretary of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
40 (c) At the time of filing its application to do business, every foreign
41 limited liability company shall pay to the secretary of state an application
42 and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of the secretary
43 of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.

HB 2371—Am. by SC 30
1 (d) The fee for filing a certificate of reinstatement shall be the same
2 as that prescribed by K.S.A. 17-7506, and amendments thereto, for filing a
3 certificate of reinstatement of a corporation's articles of incorporation.
4 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 17-76,143 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
5 76,143. (a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the
6 establishment of one or more designated series of members, managers,
7 limited liability company interests or assets. If an operating agreement so
8 provides for the establishment or formation of one or more series, then a
9 series may be formed by complying with this section. Any such series may
10 have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or
11 obligations of the limited liability company or profits and losses associated
12 with specified property or obligations, and to the extent provided in the
13 operating agreement, any such series may have a separate business
14 purpose or investment objective. A series is formed by the filing of a
15 certificate of designation in the office of the secretary of state. Other than
16 pursuant to K.S.A. 17-76,143a, and amendments thereto, a series may not
17 merge, convert, or consolidate pursuant to any section of the Kansas
18 revised limited liability company act, the business entity transactions act,
19 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto, or any other statute of
20 this state.
21 (b) Notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in
22 subsection (c) shall be set forth in the articles of organization of the limited
23 liability company. Notice in articles of organization of the limitation on
24 liabilities of a series as referenced in subsection (c) shall be sufficient for
25 all purposes of this subsection whether or not the limited liability company
26 has formed any series when such notice is included in the articles of
27 organization, and there shall be no requirement that any specific series of
28 the limited liability company be referenced in such notice. The fact that
29 articles of organization that contain the foregoing notice of the limitation
30 on liabilities of a series is on file in the office of the secretary of state shall
31 constitute notice of such limitation on liabilities of a series.
32 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Kansas
33 revised limited liability company act or under other applicable law, in the
34 event that an operating agreement establishes or provides for the
35 establishment of one or more series, and if to the extent the records
36 maintained for any series account for the assets associated with such series
37 separately from the other assets of the limited liability company, or any
38 other series thereof, and if the operating agreement so provides, and if
39 notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this
40 subsection is set forth in the articles of organization of the limited liability
41 company and if the limited liability company has filed a certificate of
42 designation for each series which that is to have limited liability under this
43 section, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred,

HB 2371—Am. by SC 31
1 contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such series shall be
2 enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets
3 of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, and,
4 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, none of the debts,
5 liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise
6 existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any
7 other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.
8 Neither the preceding sentences nor any provision pursuant thereto in an
9 operating agreement, articles of organization or certificate of designation
10 shall: Restrict a series or limited liability company on behalf of a series
11 from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of
12 the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
13 otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally
14 or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such
15 series; or restrict a limited liability company from agreeing in the
16 operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, liabilities,
17 obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing
18 with respect to a series shall be enforceable against the assets of the
19 limited liability company generally. Assets associated with a series may be
20 held directly or indirectly, including in the name of such series, in the
21 name of the limited liability company, through a nominee or otherwise.
22 Records maintained for a series that reasonably identify its assets,
23 including by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational, or
24 allocational formula or procedure, including a percentage or share of any
25 asset or assets, or by any other method where the identity of such assets is
26 objectively determinable, will be deemed to account for the assets
27 associated with such series separately from the other assets of the limited
28 liability company, or any other series thereof. As used in the Kansas
29 revised limited liability company act, a reference to assets of a series
30 includes assets associated with such series, a reference to assets associated
31 with a series includes assets of such series, a reference to members or
32 managers of a series includes members or managers associated with such
33 series, and a reference to members or managers associated with a series
34 includes members or managers of such series. The following shall apply to
35 a series:
36 (1) A series may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity,
37 whether or not for profit, with the exception of the business of granting
38 policies of insurance, assuming insurance risks, or banking as defined in
39 K.S.A. 9-702, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise provided in an
40 operating agreement, a series shall have the power and capacity to, in its
41 own name, contract, hold title to assets, including real, personal, and
42 intangible property, grant liens and security interests, and sue and be sued
43 and otherwise conduct business and exercise the power of a limited

HB 2371—Am. by SC 32
1 liability company under this article. The limited liability company and
2 any of its series may elect to consolidate its operations as a single
3 taxpayer to the extent required to file consolidated tax returns as
4 permitted under applicable law and elect to be treated as a single
5 business for the purposes of qualification or authorization to do
6 business in this or any other state. Such elections shall not affect the
7 limitation of liability set forth in this section except to the extent that
8 the series have specifically accepted joint liability by contract.
9 (2) Except as otherwise provided by the Kansas revised limited
10 liability company act, no member or manager of a series shall be obligated
11 personally for any debt, obligation or liability of such series, whether
12 arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member
13 or acting as manager of such series. Notwithstanding the preceding
14 sentence, under an operating agreement or under another agreement, a
15 member or manager may agree to be obligated personally for any or all of
16 the debts, obligations and liabilities of one or more series.
17 (3) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
18 members or managers associated with a series having such relative rights,
19 powers and duties as the operating agreement may provide, and may make
20 provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the operating
21 agreement of additional classes or groups of members or managers
22 associated with such series having such relative rights, powers and duties
23 as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and
24 duties senior to existing classes and groups of members or managers
25 associated with such series. An operating agreement may provide for the
26 taking of an action, including the amendment of the operating agreement,
27 without the vote, consent or approval of any member or manager or class
28 or group of members or managers, including an action to create under the
29 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of a series of
30 limited liability company interests that was not previously outstanding. An
31 operating agreement may provide that any member or class or group of
32 members associated with a series shall have no voting rights or ability to
33 otherwise participate in the management or governance of such series,
34 but any such member or class or group of members are owners of the
35 series.
36 (4) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
37 members or managers or a specified class or group of the members or
38 managers associated with a series the right to vote separately or with all or
39 any class or group of the members or managers associated with such
40 series, on any matter. Voting by members or managers associated with a
41 series may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or
42 any other basis.
43 (5) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the

HB 2371—Am. by SC 33
1 management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with
2 such series in proportion to the then-current percentage or other interest of
3 members in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
4 associated with such series, the decision of members owning more than
5 50% of such percentage or other interest in the profits controlling, except
6 that if an operating agreement provides for the management of a series, in
7 whole or in part, by a manager or managers, the management of such
8 series, to the extent so provided, shall be vested in the manager or
9 managers who shall be chosen in the manner provided in the operating
10 agreement. The manager of a series shall also hold the offices and have the
11 responsibilities accorded to the manager as set forth in an operating
12 agreement. A series may have more than one manager. Subject to K.S.A.
13 17-76,105, and amendments thereto, a manager shall cease to be a
14 manager with respect to a series as provided in an operating agreement.
15 Except as otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event under
16 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or in an operating
17 agreement that causes a manager to cease to be a manager with respect to a
18 series shall not, in itself, cause such manager to cease to be a manager of
19 the limited liability company or with respect to any other series thereof.
20 (6) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,109, and amendments thereto, but
21 subject to subsections (c)(7) and (c)(10), and unless otherwise provided in
22 an operating agreement, at the time a member of a series becomes entitled
23 to receive a distribution with respect to such series, the member has the
24 status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of such
25 series, with respect to the distribution. An operating agreement may
26 provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations
27 and distributions with respect to a series.
28 (7) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,110(a), and amendments thereto, a
29 limited liability company may make a distribution with respect to a series.
30 A limited liability company shall not make a distribution with respect to a
31 series to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after
32 giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of such series, other than
33 liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company
34 interests with respect to such series and liabilities for which the recourse of
35 creditors is limited to specified property of such series, exceed the fair
36 value of the assets associated with such series, except that the fair value of
37 property of such series that is subject to a liability for which the recourse
38 of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets associated with such
39 series only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that
40 liability. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
41 "distribution" shall not include amounts constituting reasonable
42 compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in
43 the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or

HB 2371—Am. by SC 34
1 other benefits program. A member who receives a distribution in violation
2 of this subsection, and who knew at the time of the distribution that the
3 distribution violated this subsection, shall be liable to the series for the
4 amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in
5 violation of this subsection, and who did not know at the time of the
6 distribution that the distribution violated this subsection, shall not be liable
7 for the amount of the distribution. Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,110(c), and
8 amendments thereto, which shall apply to any distribution made with
9 respect to a series under this subsection, this subsection shall not affect any
10 obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable
11 law for the amount of a distribution.
12 (8) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member
13 shall cease to be associated with a series and to have the power to exercise
14 any rights or powers of a member with respect to such series upon the
15 assignment of all of the member's limited liability company interest with
16 respect to such series. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
17 agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability company
18 act or an operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be
19 associated with a series shall not, in itself, cause such member to cease to
20 be associated with any other series or terminate the continued membership
21 of a member in the limited liability company or cause the dissolution of
22 the series, regardless of whether such member was the last remaining
23 member associated with such series.
24 (9) Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments thereto, except to
25 the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series may be
26 dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the
27 limited liability company. The dissolution of a series shall not affect the
28 limitation on liabilities of such series provided by this subsection (c). A
29 series is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the dissolution of
30 the limited liability company under K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments
31 thereto, or otherwise upon the first to occur of the following:
32 (A) At the time specified in the operating agreement;
33 (B) upon the happening of events specified in the operating
34 agreement;
35 (C) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, upon the
36 vote, consent or approval of members associated with such series who own
37 2/ or more of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of
3
38 such series of the limited liability company owned by all of the members
39 associated with such series; or
40 (D) the dissolution of such series under subsection (c)(11).
41 (10) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,118(a), and amendments thereto,
42 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a manager
43 associated with a series who has not wrongfully dissolved such series or, if

HB 2371—Am. by SC 35

35 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation, shall
36 not require such series to wind up its affairs under K.S.A. 17-76,143, and
37 amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under
38 K.S.A. 17-76,143, and amendments thereto, and the merger or
39 consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such series.

41 liability company shall not have the power to merge or consolidate as set

19 does not contain the term "statutory public benefit limited liability
20 company," or the abbreviation "S.P.B.L.L.C.," or the designation

22 they are written in Roman characters or letters, the statutory public benefit
23 limited liability company shall, prior to issuing any limited liability
24 company interest, provide notice to any person to whom such limited

16 statement, without charge, to any person that requests a copy. Any
17 compensation paid to any person and any other financial or proprietary
18 information contained in the statement described in subsection (a) may be
19 omitted from any statement that is publicly posted or provided to any

14 another entity which that succeeds to its assets by operation of law, shall
15 be deemed a change of name for purposes of this section;
16 (2) the conversion of the resident agent into another person; or
17 (3) a division of the resident agent in which an identified resulting
18 person succeeds to all of the assets and liabilities of the resident agent

29 registered office for each such covered entity, and further certifying to the
30 new address to which each such registered office will be changed on a
31 given day, and at which new address such resident agent will thereafter
32 maintain the registered office for each of the covered entities recited in the

41 amendments thereto, may resign without appointing a successor by paying
42 a fee if authorized by law, as provided by K.S.A. 17-7910, and
43 amendments thereto, and filing a certificate of resignation, with the

HB 2371—Am. by SC 59
1 secretary of state stating that the resident agent resigns as resident agent
2 for the covered entity or entities identified in the certificate, but such
3 resignation shall not become effective until 30 days after the certificate is
4 filed. The certificate shall be executed by the resident agent, shall contain a
5 statement that written notice of resignation was given to each affected the
6 covered entity at least 30 days prior to the filing of the certificate by

10 information of an officer, director, employee or designated agent who is
11 then authorized to receive communications from the resident agent with

13 and such information shall not be deemed public information and will not
14 constitute a public record as defined in K.S.A. 45-217, and amendments
15 thereto.
16 (b) After receipt of the notice of the resignation of its resident agent,

22 name and postal address of the successor resident agent. Upon such filing,
23 the successor resident agent shall become the resident agent of such
24 covered entity and the successor resident agent's postal address, as stated
25 in such certificate, shall become the postal address of the covered entity's
26 registered office in this state. If such covered entity fails to obtain and
27 designate a new resident agent as aforesaid, prior to the expiration of the
28 period of 60 days after the filing by the resident agent of the certificate of
29 resignation, the secretary of state shall declare the entity's organizing
30 documents forfeited.
31 (c) After the resignation of the resident agent shall have become
32 effective, as provided in subsection (a), and if no new resident agent shall

38 prescribed by K.S.A. 60-304, and amendments thereto.
39 (d) Any covered entity affected by the filing of a certificate under this
40 section shall not be required to take any further action to amend its public
41 organic documents to reflect a change of registered office or resident
42 agent.
