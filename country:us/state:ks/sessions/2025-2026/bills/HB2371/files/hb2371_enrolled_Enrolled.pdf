2024 Supp. 17-76,136 and repealing the existing sections; also repealing K.S.A. 17-

.
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
New Section 1. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b),
without limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be
documented or the manner in which a document may be signed or
delivered:
(A) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the
Kansas revised limited liability company act or the operating agreement
may be provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission is
the equivalent of a written document.
(B) Whenever the Kansas revised limited liability company act or
the operating agreement requires or permits a signature, the signature
may be a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature.
"Electronic signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is
attached to, or logically associated with, a document and executed or
adopted by a person with an intent to execute, authenticate or adopt the
document. A person may execute a document with such person's
signature.
(C) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or
agreed between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is
delivered to a person for purposes of the Kansas revised limited
liability company act and the operating agreement when it enters an
information processing system that the person has designated for the
purpose of receiving electronic transmissions of the type delivered if
the electronic transmission is in a form capable of being processed by
that system and such person is able to retrieve the electronic
transmission. Whether a person has so designated an information
processing system is determined by the operating agreement or from
the context and surrounding circumstances, including the parties'
conduct. An electronic transmission is delivered under this section even
if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an electronic
acknowledgement from an information processing system establishes
that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not
establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
(2) The Kansas revised limited liability company act shall not
prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in
accordance with the uniform electronic transactions act, K.S.A. 16-601
et seq., and amendments thereto, if the part or parts of the transaction
that are governed by the Kansas revised limited liability company act
are documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this
subsection or otherwise in accordance with the Kansas revised limited
liability company act. This subsection shall apply solely for purposes of
determining whether an act or transaction has been documented, and
the document has been signed and delivered, in accordance with the

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 2
Kansas revised limited liability company act and the operating
agreement.
(b) (1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to:
(A) A document filed with or submitted to the secretary of state or
a court or other judicial or governmental body of this state;
(B) a certificate of limited liability company interest, except that a
signature on a certificate of limited liability company interest may be
manual, facsimile or electronic signature; and
(C) an act or transaction effected pursuant to article 79 of chapter
17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or
K.S.A. 17-7667, 17-76,130, 17-76,131, 17-76,132 and 17-76,133, and
amendments thereto.
(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not create any
presumption about the lawful means to document a matter addressed by
this subsection or the lawful means to sign or deliver a document
addressed by this subsection. A provision of the operating agreement
shall not limit the application of subsection (a) unless the provision
expressly restricts one or more of the means of documenting an act or
transaction, or of signing or delivering a document, permitted by
subsection (a).
(c) In the event that any provision of the Kansas revised limited
liability company act is deemed to modify, limit or supersede the
federal electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15
U.S.C. § 7001 et. seq., the provisions of the Kansas revised limited
liability company act shall control to the fullest extent permitted by 15
U.S.C. § 7002(a)(2).
(d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
New Sec. 2. (a) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas,
a subscription for a limited liability company interest, whether
submitted in writing, by means of electronic transmission or as
otherwise permitted by applicable law, is irrevocable if the subscription
states that such subscription is irrevocable to the extent provided by the
terms of the subscription.
(b) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.
Sec. 3. K.S.A. 17-7662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-

(k)(m) "Operating agreement" means any agreement, whether
referred to as an operating agreement, limited liability company
agreement or otherwise, written, oral, or implied, of the member or

signed by a person being admitted as a member or becoming an
assignee as provided in subsection (k)(1), or by reason of its having
been signed by a representative as provided in the Kansas revised
limited liability company act; and

does not continue to hold title to membership in the limited liability
company following such natural person's death for more than a
reasonable period of time necessary to dispose of such membership;
(4) a Kansas professional corporation or foreign professional

or injunction against a limited liability company engaging in the
practice of a profession without complying with the provisions of this
act.
(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary,
without limiting the general powers enumerated in subsection (b), a
limited liability company shall, subject to such standards and
restrictions, if any, as are set forth in its operating agreement, have the
power and authority to make contracts of guaranty and suretyship and
enter into interest rate, basis, currency, hedge or other swap agreements
or cap, floor, put, call, option, exchange or collar agreements,

ratified, or the failure to comply with any requirements of the operating
agreement making such act or transaction void or voidable may be
waived, by the members, managers or other persons whose approval
would be required under the operating agreement (i) for such act or
transaction to be validly taken, or (ii) to amend the operating
agreement in a manner that would permit such act or transaction to be
validly taken, in each case at the time of such ratification or waiver.

whose approval would be required to amend the operating agreement,
notice of such ratification or waiver shall be given following such
ratification or waiver to the members, managers or other persons who
would have been entitled to notice of such an amendment and who
have not otherwise received notice of, or participated in, such
ratification or waiver.

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 7
(4) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to
limit the accomplishment of a ratification or waiver of a void or
voidable act by other means permitted by law.
(5) Upon application of the limited liability company, any
member, manager or person claiming to be substantially and adversely
affected by a ratification or waiver pursuant to this subsection,
excluding any harm that would have resulted if such act or transaction
had been valid when taken, the district court may hear and determine
the validity and effectiveness of the ratification of, or waiver with
respect to, any void or voidable act or transaction effectuated pursuant
to this subsection. In any such application, the limited liability
company shall be named as a party and service of the application upon
the resident agent of the limited liability company shall be deemed to
be service upon the limited liability company, and no other party need
be joined in order for the court to adjudicate the validity and
effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The court may make such
order respecting further or other notice of such application as it deems
proper under these circumstances. Nothing in this paragraph limits or
affects the right to serve process in any other manner now or hereafter
provided by law, and this provision is an extension of and not a
limitation upon the right otherwise existing of service of legal process
upon nonresidents.
Sec. 6. K.S.A. 17-7670 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-

extent that a present or former member, manager, or officer, employee

merits or otherwise as a plaintiff in an action to determine that the
plaintiff is a member of a limited liability company or in defense of any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a member, manager, officer, employee or agent of
the limited liability company, or is or was serving at the request of the
limited liability company as a member, manager, director, officer,
employee or agent of another limited liability company, corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or in defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, such member, manager, officer,

person in connection therewith, including attorney fees.

occurring after June 30, 2025, references to "officer" for purposes of
this subsection only means an officer of the limited liability company
who:
(A) Is or was the president, chief executive officer, chief operating
officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, controller, treasurer or
chief accounting officer of the limited liability company; or

(B) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a
limited liability company whose original articles of organization were
filed with the secretary of state and effective on or prior to June 30,
2019, shall not be governed by subsection (a)(1)(A), but shall be
governed by this subparagraph. Unless otherwise provided in the
operating agreement, an agreement of merger or consolidation shall be
consented to or approved by each domestic limited liability company
which that is to merge or consolidate by the members, or if there is
more than one class or group of members, then by each class or group
of members, in either case, by members who own more than 50% of
the then current percentage or other interest in the profits of the
domestic limited liability company owned by all of the members or by
the members in each class or group, as appropriate.
(2) In connection with a merger or consolidation hereunder, rights
or securities of, or interests in, a domestic limited liability company
which that is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be
exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of,
or interests in, the surviving or resulting limited liability company or, in
addition to or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into
cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, an entity as

merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a
provision for such termination or amendment contained in the
agreement of merger or consolidation.
(b) The limited liability company surviving or resulting in or from
the merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or
consolidation executed by one or more authorized persons on behalf of

domestic limited liability company, a statement that such surviving or
resulting limited liability company agrees that it may be served with

the secretary of state as its agent to accept service of process in any
such action, suit or proceeding and specifying the address to which a
copy of such process shall be mailed to it by the secretary of state.
(c) A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate
of cancellation for a domestic limited liability company which that is
not the surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or
consolidation. A certificate of merger that sets forth any amendment in
accordance with subsection (b)(4) shall be deemed to be an amendment
to the articles of organization of the limited liability company, and the
limited liability company shall not be required to take any further
action to amend its articles of organization under K.S.A. 17-7674 or
17-7680, and amendments thereto, with respect to such amendments set
forth in the certificate of merger. Whenever this section requires the
filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation, such requirement shall
be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of merger or
consolidation containing the information required by this section to be
set forth in the certificate of merger or consolidation.
(d) (1) For a limited liability company if it is the surviving or
resulting limited liability company in the merger or consolidation, an
agreement of merger or consolidation consented to or approved in
accordance with subsection (a) may:

adoption of a new operating agreement, other than a provision that by
its terms applies to an amendment to the operating agreement or the
adoption of a new operating agreement, in either case, in connection
with a merger or consolidation. The provisions of this subsection shall
not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a merger or of any of
the matters referred to herein by any other means provided for in an
operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by
law, including that the operating agreement of any constituent limited
liability company to the merger or consolidation, including a limited
liability company formed for the purpose of consummating a merger or
consolidation, shall be the operating agreement of the surviving or
resulting limited liability company.

under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all
of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the limited liability

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 10

personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of the limited liability
companies, as well as all other things and causes of action belonging to
each of such limited liability companies, shall be vested in the
surviving or resulting limited liability company, and shall thereafter be
the property of the surviving or resulting limited liability company as
they were of each of the limited liability companies that have merged
or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or
otherwise, under the laws of the state of Kansas, in any of such limited
liability companies, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by
reason of this act, but all rights of creditors and all liens upon any
property of any of the limited liability companies shall be preserved
unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the limited
liability companies that have merged or consolidated shall thenceforth
attach to the surviving or resulting limited liability company, and may
be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and
duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed, a
merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company,
including a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not
require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs
under K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities
and distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments
thereto, and the merger or consolidation shall not constitute a
dissolution of such limited liability company.

into any other entity in accordance with the business entity transactions
act, K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto.

consolidation in which the limited liability company or a series of the
limited liability company is a constituent party to the merger or
consolidation, any division of the limited liability company, or the sale
of all or substantially all of the limited liability company's assets. The
district court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter
relating to any such appraisal rights provided in an operating
agreement or an agreement of merger or consolidation or a plan of
division.
Sec. 9. K.S.A. 17-7685a is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
7685a. (a) As used in this section, and K.S.A. 17-76,150, and
amendments thereto, and K.S.A. 17-7675 and 17-7686, and

two or more domestic limited liability companies. The division of a
domestic limited liability company in accordance with this section and,
if applicable, the resulting cessation of the existence of the dividing
company pursuant to a certificate of division shall not be deemed to
affect the personal liability of any person incurred prior to such division
with respect to matters arising prior to such division, nor shall it be
deemed to affect the validity or enforceability of any obligations or
liabilities of the dividing company incurred prior to such division;,
except that such the obligations and liabilities of the dividing company
shall be allocated to and vested in, and valid and enforceable
obligations of, such division company or companies to which such
obligations and liabilities have been allocated pursuant to the plan of
division, as provided in subsection (l). Each resulting company in a

Kansas revised limited liability company act and subsection (i).
(c) If the operating agreement of the dividing company specifies
the manner of adopting a plan of division, the plan of division shall be
adopted as specified in the operating agreement. If the operating
agreement of the dividing company does not specify the manner of

limited liability company, the plan of division shall be adopted in the
same manner as is specified in the operating agreement for authorizing
a merger or consolidation that involves the limited liability company as
a constituent party to the merger or consolidation. If the operating
agreement of the dividing company does not specify the manner of
adopting a plan of division or authorizing a merger or consolidation
that involves the limited liability company as a constituent party and
does not prohibit a division of the limited liability company, the
adoption of a plan of division shall be authorized by the consent or
approval of members who own more than 50% of the then-current
percentage or other interest in the profits of the dividing company
owned by all of the members. Notwithstanding prior consent or

a provision for such termination or amendment contained in the plan of
division.

a domestic limited liability company pursuant to this section shall not
require such limited liability company to wind up its affairs under
K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and
distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto,
and the division shall not constitute a dissolution of such limited
liability company.
(e) In connection with a division under this section, rights or
securities of, or interests in, the dividing company may be exchanged

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 12
for or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests
in, the surviving company or any resulting company or, in addition to
or in lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash,
property, rights or securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in
K.S.A. 17-78-102, and amendments thereto, that is not a division
company, or may be canceled or remain outstanding, if the dividing
company is a surviving company.
(f) (1) A plan of division adopted in accordance with subsection
(c):
(A) May effect: (i) Any amendment to the operating agreement of
the dividing company if it is a surviving company in the division; or (ii)
the adoption of a new operating agreement for the dividing company if

(B) shall effect the adoption of a new an operating agreement for
each resulting company.
(2) Any amendment to an operating agreement or adoption of a
new operating agreement for the dividing company, if it is a surviving
company in the division, or adoption of a new an operating agreement
for each resulting company made pursuant to this subsection shall be
effective at the effective time or date of the division. Any amendment
to an operating agreement or adoption of an operating agreement for
the dividing company, if it is a surviving company in the division, shall
be effective notwithstanding any provision in the operating agreement
of the dividing company relating to amendment or adoption of a new
operating agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to
an amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new
operating agreement, in either case, in connection with a division,
merger or consolidation.
(g) If a domestic limited liability company is dividing under this
section, the dividing company shall adopt a plan of division that shall
set forth:
(1) The terms and conditions of the division, including:
(A) Any conversion or exchange of the limited liability company
interests of the dividing company into or for limited liability company
interests or other securities or obligations of any division company or
cash, property, or rights or securities or obligations of or interests in an
entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102, and amendments thereto, that is
not a division company, or that the limited liability company interests
of the dividing company shall remain outstanding or be canceled, or
any combination of the foregoing; and
(B) the allocation of assets, property, rights, series, debts,
liabilities, and duties of the dividing company among the division
companies;
(2) the name of each resulting company and, if the dividing
company will survive the division, the name of the surviving company;
(3) the name and business address of a division contact, which
shall have custody of a copy of the plan of division. The division

years following the effective date of the division. During such six-year
period, the division contact shall provide, without cost, to any creditor
of the dividing company, within 30 days following the division
contact's receipt of a written request from any creditor of the dividing
company, the name and business address of the division company to
which the claim of such creditor was allocated pursuant to the plan of
division; and
(4) any other matters that the dividing company determines to
include therein.
(h) (1) If a domestic limited liability company divides under this
section, the surviving dividing company, if any, or any other division

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 13
company shall file a certificate of division executed by one or more
authorized persons on behalf of such division dividing company in the
office of the secretary of state in accordance with K.S.A. 17-7910, and
amendments thereto, and articles of organization that comply with
K.S.A. 17-7673, and amendments thereto, for each resulting company

17-7908(b), and amendments thereto.

to any member of the dividing company; and
(H) any other information that the dividing company determines
to include therein.
(3) A certificate of division may be amended to change the name
or business address of the division contact in a certificate of division or
to change information in the certificate of division required by
subsection (h)(2)(F). A certificate of division is amended by filing a
certificate of amendment of certificate of division for each division
company that exists as a limited liability company in the office of the
secretary of state. Each certificate of amendment of certificate of
division shall include all of the following:
(A) The name of the dividing company and, if the name has been
changed, the name under which the dividing company's articles of
organization were originally filed;
(B) the name of the division company to which the amendment to
the certificate of division relates; and

company, any member of the dividing company who becomes aware
that the name or business address of the division contact, or
information in the certificate of division required by subsection (h)(2)
(F), in a certificate of division was false when made or that the name
or business address of the division contact, or information in the
certificate of division required by subsection (h)(2)(F), in a certificate
of division has changed, shall promptly amend the certificate of
division. If the dividing company is not a surviving company or no
longer exists as a limited liability company, a manager of any resulting
company or, if there is no manager of any resulting company, then any
member of any resulting company who becomes aware that the name
or business address of the division contact, or information in the
certificate of division required by subsection (h)(2)(F), in a certificate
of division was false when made or that the name or business address
of the division contact, or information in the certificate of division

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 14
required by subsection (h)(2)(F), in a certificate of division has
changed, shall promptly amend the certificate of division. This
subsection does not apply after the expiration of a period of six years
following the effective date of the division.
(5) (A) Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division or the
certificate of division, each certificate of amendment of certificate of
division shall be executed as follows:

authorized persons on behalf of the dividing company acting on behalf
of the division company to which the certificate of amendment of
certificate of division relates; and

longer exists as a limited liability company, by one or more authorized
persons on behalf of a resulting company acting on behalf of the
division company to which the certificate of amendment of certificate
of division relates.
(B) Each division company is deemed to have consented to the
execution of a certificate of amendment of certificate of division under
this paragraph.
(6) Unless otherwise provided in the Kansas revised limited
liability company act or unless a later effective date or time, which
shall be a date or time certain, is provided for in the certificate of
amendment of certificate of division, a certificate of amendment of
certificate of division is effective at the time of its filing with the
secretary of state.
(7) Subject to the Kansas revised limited liability company act, the
secretary of state shall accept the filing of certificates of amendment of
certificate of division for all division companies resulting from the
same certificates of division if at least one division company is in good
standing at the time of such filings.
(i) The certificate of division and each articles of organization for
each resulting company required by subsection (h) shall be filed
simultaneously in the office of the secretary of state and, if such
certificate and articles of organization are not to become effective upon
their filing, then each such certificate shall provide for the same
effective date or time in accordance with K.S.A. 17-7911, and
amendments thereto. Concurrently with the effective date or time of a
division, the operating agreement of each resulting company shall
become effective.
(j) A certificate of division shall act as a certificate of cancellation
for a dividing company that is not a surviving company.
(k) An operating agreement may provide that a domestic limited
liability company shall not have the power to divide as set forth in this
section.
(l) Upon the division of a domestic limited liability company
becoming effective:
(1) The dividing company shall be subdivided divided into the
distinct and independent resulting division companies named in the
plan of division, and, if the dividing company is not a surviving
company, the existence of the dividing company shall cease.
(2) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of the
rights, privileges and powers, and all the property, real, personal, and
mixed, of the dividing company and all debts due on whatever account
to it, as well as all other things and other causes of action belonging to
it, shall without further action be allocated to and vested in the
applicable division company in such a manner and basis and with such
effect as is specified in the plan of division, and the title to any real
property or interest therein allocated to and vested in any division
company shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 15
division.
(3) Each division company shall, from and after effectiveness of
the certificate of division, be liable as a separate and distinct domestic
limited liability company for such debts, liabilities and duties of the
dividing company as are allocated to such division company pursuant
to the plan of division in the manner and on the basis provided in
subsection (g)(1)(B).
(4) Each of the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing
company shall without further action be allocated to and be the debts,
liabilities and duties of such division company as is specified in the
plan of division as having such debts, liabilities and duties allocated to
it, in such a manner and basis and with such effect as is specified in the
plan of division, and no other division company shall be liable therefor,
so long as the plan of division does not constitute a fraudulent transfer
under applicable law, and all liens upon any property of the dividing
company shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the dividing company shall remain attached to the division
company to which such debts, liabilities and duties have been allocated
in the plan of division, and may be enforced against such division
company to the same extent as if such debts, liabilities and duties had
originally been incurred or contracted by it in its capacity as a domestic
limited liability company.
(5) In the event that any allocation of assets, debts, liabilities and
duties to division companies in accordance with a plan of division is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute a
fraudulent transfer, each division company shall be jointly and
severally liable on account of such fraudulent transfer notwithstanding
the allocations made in the plan of division, except that the validity and
effectiveness of the division are not otherwise affected thereby.
(6) Debts and liabilities of the dividing company that are not
allocated by the plan of division shall be the joint and several debts and
liabilities of all of the division companies.
(7) It shall not be necessary for a plan of division to list each
individual asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty of the
dividing company to be allocated to a division company so long as the
assets, property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties so allocated are
reasonably identified by any method where the identity of such assets,
property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties is objectively
determinable.
(8) The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the
dividing company that have been allocated to a division company, as
well as the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company that
have been allocated to such division company pursuant to a plan of
division, shall remain vested in each such division company and shall
not be deemed, as a result of the division, to have been assigned or
transferred to such division company for any purpose of the laws of the
state of Kansas.
(9) Any action or proceeding pending against a dividing company
may be continued against the surviving company, if any, as if the
division did not occur, but subject to paragraph (4), and against any
resulting company to which the asset, property, right, series, debt,
liability or duty associated with such action or proceeding was
allocated pursuant to the plan of division by adding or substituting such
resulting company as a party in the action or proceeding.
(m) In applying the provisions of the Kansas revised limited
liability company act on distributions, a direct or indirect allocation of
property or liabilities in a division is not deemed a distribution.
(n) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit
the means of accomplishing a division by any other means provided for

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 16
in an operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise permitted
by the Kansas revised limited liability company act or as otherwise
permitted by law.
(o) All limited liability companies formed on and after July 1,
2019, shall be governed by this section. All limited liability companies
formed prior to July 1, 2019, shall be governed by this section, except
that if the dividing company is a party to any written contract, indenture
or other agreement entered into prior to July 1, 2019, that, by its terms,
restricts, conditions or prohibits the consummation of a merger or
consolidation by the dividing company with or into another party, or
the transfer of assets by the dividing company to another party, then
such restriction, condition or prohibition shall be deemed to apply to a
division as if it were a merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, as
applicable.
Sec. 10. K.S.A. 17-7686 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
7686. (a) In connection with the formation of a limited liability
company, a person is admitted as a member of the limited liability

admitted as a member of the limited liability company:
(1) In the case of a person who is not an assignee of a limited

liability company interest directly from the limited liability company
and a person to be admitted as a member of the limited liability
company without acquiring a limited liability company interest in the
limited liability company at the time provided in and upon compliance

action, including the amendment of the operating agreement, without
the vote, consent or approval of any member or class or group of
members, including an action to create under the provisions of the
operating agreement a class or group of limited liability company
interests that was not previously outstanding. An operating agreement
may provide that any member or class or group of members shall have
no voting rights.
(b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
members or a specified class or group of the members the right to vote
separately or with all or any class or group of the members or
managers, on any matter. Voting by members may be on a per capita,

is to be voted on by any members, waiver of any such notice, action by
consent or approval without a meeting, the establishment of a record
date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy, or any other

at the meeting. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement,
on any matter that is to be voted on, consented to or approved by
members, the members may take such action without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if consented to or approved, in
writing, by electronic transmission, or by any other means permitted by

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 18
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at

Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, if a person,
whether or not then a member, consents to or approves as a member
any matter and provides that such consent or approval will be effective
at a future time, including a time determined upon the happening of an
event, then such person shall be deemed to have consented or approved
as a member at such future time so long as such person is then a
member. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any
matter that is to be voted on by members, the members may vote in
person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing, by
means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a

interest in profits shall be entitled to vote.
(f) If an operating agreement provides for the manner in which it
may be amended, including by requiring the approval or consent of a
person who is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction
of conditions, it may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise
permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
amendments thereto, provided that the approval or consent of any
person may be waived by such person and that any such conditions
may be waived by all persons for whose benefit such conditions were
intended. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
supermajority amendment provision shall only apply to provisions of
the operating agreement that are expressly included in the operating
agreement. As used in this section, "supermajority amendment
provision" means any amendment provision set forth in an operating
agreement requiring that an amendment to a provision of the operating
agreement be adopted by no less than the vote or consent or approval
required to take action under such latter provision.
(g) If an operating agreement does not provide for the manner in
which it may be amended, the operating agreement may be amended
with the approval or consent of all of the members or as otherwise
permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
amendments thereto. This subsection shall only apply to a limited
liability company whose original articles of organization were filed

(4) a copy of any written operating agreement and articles of
organization and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies
of any written powers of attorney pursuant to which the operating
agreement and any certificate and all amendments thereto have been
executed;
(5) true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or
services contributed by each member and which each member has
agreed to contribute in the future, and the date on which each became a
member; and
(6) other information regarding the affairs of the limited liability
company as is just and reasonable.
(b) Each manager shall have the right to examine all of the
information described in subsection (a) for a purpose reasonably related
to the position of manager.
(c) The manager of a limited liability company shall have the right
to keep confidential from the members, for such period of time as the
manager deems reasonable, any information which that the manager
reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other
information the disclosure of which the manager in good faith believes
is not in the best interest of the limited liability company or could
damage the limited liability company or its business or which the
limited liability company is required by law or by agreement with a
third party to keep confidential.
(d) A limited liability company may maintain its books, records
and other documents in other than a written paper form, including on,
by means of, or in the form of any information storage device, method,
or one or more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
distributed electronic networks or databases, if such form is capable of
conversion into written paper form within a reasonable time.
(e) Any demand under this section shall be in writing and shall
state the purpose of such demand. In every instance where an attorney
or other agent is the person who seeks the right to obtain the
information described in subsection (a), the demand shall be
accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that
authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the member.
(f) Any action to enforce any right arising under this section shall
be brought in the district court. If the limited liability company refuses
to permit a member, or attorney or other agent acting for the member,
to obtain or a manager to examine the information described in
subsection (a) or does not reply to the demand that has been made
within five business days, or such shorter or longer period of time as is
provided for in an operating agreement, but not longer than 30 business
days, after the demand has been made, the demanding member or
manager may apply to the district court for an order to compel such
disclosure. The district court may summarily order the limited liability
company to permit the demanding member to obtain or manager to
examine the information described in subsection (a) and to make copies
or abstracts therefrom, or the district court may summarily order the
limited liability company to furnish to the demanding member or

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 20
manager the information described in subsection (a) on the condition
that the demanding member or manager first pay to the limited liability
company the reasonable cost of obtaining and furnishing such
information and on such other conditions as the district court deems
appropriate. When a demanding member seeks to obtain or a manager
seeks to examine the information described in subsection (a), the
demanding member or manager shall first establish: (1) That the
demanding member or manager has complied with the provisions of
this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for
obtaining or examining of such information; and (2) that the
information the demanding member or manager seeks is reasonably
related to the member's interest as a member or the manager's position
as a manager, as the case may be. The district court may, in its
discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the
obtaining or examining of information, or award such other or further
relief as the district court may deem just and proper. The district court
may order books, documents and records and other documents,
pertinent extracts therefrom, or duly authenticated copies thereof, to be
brought within the state of Kansas and kept in the state of Kansas upon
such terms and conditions as the order may prescribe.
(g) If a member is entitled to obtain information under the Kansas
revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement for a
purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member or
other stated purpose, the member's right shall be to obtain such
information as is necessary and essential to achieving that purpose.
The rights of a member or manager to obtain or examine information as
provided in this section may be expanded or restricted in an original
operating agreement or in any subsequent amendment consented to,
approved or adopted by all of the members or in compliance with any
applicable requirements of the operating agreement. The provisions of
this subsection shall not be construed to limit the ability to impose
restrictions on expand or restrict the rights of a member or manager to
obtain or examine information by any other means permitted under the
Kansas revised limited liability company act by law.
(h) A limited liability company shall maintain a current record that
identifies the name and last known business, residence, or mailing
address of each member and manager.
Sec. 13. K.S.A. 17-7695 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
7695. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as the
operating agreement may provide, and may make provision for the
future creation in the manner provided in the operating agreement of
additional classes or groups of managers having such relative rights,
powers and duties as may from time to time be established, including
rights, powers and duties senior to existing classes and groups of
managers. An operating agreement may provide for the taking of an
action, including the amendment of the operating agreement, without
the vote, consent or approval of any manager or class or group of
managers, including an action to create under the provisions of the
operating agreement a class or group of limited liability company
interests that was not previously outstanding.
(b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
managers or a specified class or group of the managers the right to
vote, separately or with all or any class or group of managers or
members, on any matter. Voting by managers may be on a per capita,
number, financial interest, class, group or any other basis. Unless
otherwise provided in an operating agreement, if more than one
manager is appointed, all managers shall have an equal vote per capita.
(c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 21
notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter
is to be voted on by any manager or class or group of managers, waiver
of any such notice, action by consent or approval without a meeting,
the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in
person or by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of
any such right to vote.
(d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement,
meetings of managers may be held by means of conference telephone
or other communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a
meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute presence in person
at the meeting. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement,
on any matter that is to be voted on, consented to or approved by the
managers, the managers may take such action without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if consented to or approved, in
writing, by electronic transmission, or by any other means permitted by
law, by managers having not less than the minimum number of votes
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all managers entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, if a person,
whether or not then a manager, consents to or approves as a manager
any matter and provides that such consent or approval will be effective
at a future time, including a time determined upon the happening of an
event, then such person shall be deemed to have consented or approved
as a manager at such future time, so long as such person is then a
manager. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any
matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers may vote in
person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing, by
means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a
manager or by a person or persons authorized to act for a manager shall
be deemed to be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For
purposes of this subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means
any form of communication not directly involving the physical
transmission of paper, including the use of, or participation in, one or
more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
distributed electronic networks or databases, that creates a record that
may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof and that
may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through
an automated process.
Sec. 14. K.S.A. 17-7698 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
7698. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member
or manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority
to delegate to one or more other persons any or all of the member's or
manager's, as the case may be, rights, powers and duties to manage and
control the business and affairs of the limited liability company. Any
such delegation may be made irrespective of whether the member or
manager has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter as to which
its rights, powers or duties are being delegated, and the person or
persons to whom any such rights, powers or duties are being delegated
shall not be deemed conflicted solely by reason of the conflict of
interest of the member or manager. Any such delegation may be to
agents, officers and employees of a member or manager or the limited
liability company, and by a management agreement or another
agreement with, or otherwise to, other persons, including a committee
of one or more persons. Unless otherwise provided in the operating
agreement, such delegation by a member or manager shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable. Unless otherwise provided

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 22
in the operating agreement, such delegation by a member or manager of
a limited liability company shall not cause the member or manager to
cease to be a member or manager, as the case may be, of the limited
liability company or cause the person to whom any such rights, powers
and duties have been delegated to be a member or manager, as the case
may be, of the limited liability company. No other provision of the
Kansas revised limited liability company act or other law shall be
construed to restrict a member's or manager's power and authority to
delegate any or all of its rights, powers, and duties to manage and
control the business and affairs of the limited liability company.
Sec. 15. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 17-76,136 is hereby amended to read
as follows: 17-76,136. (a) The secretary of state shall charge each
domestic and foreign limited liability company the following fees:
(1) A fee of $20 for issuing or filing and indexing any of the
following documents:
(A) A certificate of amendment of articles of organization;
(B) restated articles of organization;
(C) a certificate of cancellation, which shall be multiplied by the
number of series of the limited liability company named in the
certificate of cancellation;
(D) a certificate of change of location of registered office or
resident agent;
(E) a certificate of merger or consolidation;
(F) a certificate of division; and
(G) any certificate, affidavit, agreement or any other paper
provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company act, for
which no different fee is specifically prescribed;
(2) a fee of $7.50 for each certified copy, regardless of whether the
secretary of state supplies the copy;
(3) a fee of $7.50 for each certificate of good standing, including a
certificate of good standing for a series of a limited liability company,
issued by the secretary of state; and
(4) a fee of $20 for a copy of an instrument on file or prepared by
the secretary of state's office, whether or not the copy is certified.
(b) Every limited liability company hereafter formed in this state
shall pay to the secretary of state, at the time of filing its articles of
organization, an application and recording fee of established by rules
and regulations of the secretary of state, except that such fee shall not
exceed $150.
(c) At the time of filing its application to do business, every
foreign limited liability company shall pay to the secretary of state an
application and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of
the secretary of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
(d) The fee for filing a certificate of reinstatement shall be the
same as that prescribed by K.S.A. 17-7506, and amendments thereto,
for filing a certificate of reinstatement of a corporation's articles of
incorporation.
Sec. 16. K.S.A. 17-76,143 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17-76,143. (a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the
establishment of one or more designated series of members, managers,
limited liability company interests or assets. If an operating agreement
so provides for the establishment or formation of one or more series,
then a series may be formed by complying with this section. Any such
series may have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to
specified property or obligations of the limited liability company or
profits and losses associated with specified property or obligations, and
to the extent provided in the operating agreement, any such series may
have a separate business purpose or investment objective. A series is
formed by the filing of a certificate of designation in the office of the

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 23
secretary of state. Other than pursuant to K.S.A. 17-76,143a, and
amendments thereto, a series may not merge, convert, or consolidate
pursuant to any section of the Kansas revised limited liability company
act, the business entity transactions act, K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and
amendments thereto, or any other statute of this state.
(b) Notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced
in subsection (c) shall be set forth in the articles of organization of the
limited liability company. Notice in articles of organization of the
limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in subsection (c) shall
be sufficient for all purposes of this subsection whether or not the
limited liability company has formed any series when such notice is
included in the articles of organization, and there shall be no
requirement that any specific series of the limited liability company be
referenced in such notice. The fact that articles of organization that
contain the foregoing notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series is
on file in the office of the secretary of state shall constitute notice of
such limitation on liabilities of a series.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
Kansas revised limited liability company act or under other applicable
law, in the event that an operating agreement establishes or provides for
the establishment of one or more series, and if to the extent the records
maintained for any series account for the assets associated with such
series separately from the other assets of the limited liability company,
or any other series thereof, and if the operating agreement so provides,
and if notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in
this subsection is set forth in the articles of organization of the limited
liability company and if the limited liability company has filed a
certificate of designation for each series which that is to have limited
liability under this section, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and
expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to
such series shall be enforceable against the assets of such series only,
and not against the assets of the limited liability company generally or
any other series thereof, and, unless otherwise provided in the operating
agreement, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses
incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the limited
liability company generally or any other series thereof shall be
enforceable against the assets of such series. Neither the preceding
sentences nor any provision pursuant thereto in an operating agreement,
articles of organization or certificate of designation shall: Restrict a
series or limited liability company on behalf of a series from agreeing
in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts,
liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company
generally or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the
assets of such series; or restrict a limited liability company from
agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the
debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
otherwise existing with respect to a series shall be enforceable against
the assets of the limited liability company generally. Assets associated
with a series may be held directly or indirectly, including in the name
of such series, in the name of the limited liability company, through a
nominee or otherwise. Records maintained for a series that reasonably
identify its assets, including by specific listing, category, type, quantity,
computational, or allocational formula or procedure, including a
percentage or share of any asset or assets, or by any other method
where the identity of such assets is objectively determinable, will be
deemed to account for the assets associated with such series separately
from the other assets of the limited liability company, or any other
series thereof. As used in the Kansas revised limited liability company

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 24
act, a reference to assets of a series includes assets associated with such
series, a reference to assets associated with a series includes assets of
such series, a reference to members or managers of a series includes
members or managers associated with such series, and a reference to
members or managers associated with a series includes members or
managers of such series. The following shall apply to a series:
(1) A series may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity,
whether or not for profit, with the exception of the business of granting
policies of insurance, assuming insurance risks, or banking as defined
in K.S.A. 9-702, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise provided
in an operating agreement, a series shall have the power and capacity
to, in its own name, contract, hold title to assets, including real,
personal, and intangible property, grant liens and security interests, and
sue and be sued and otherwise conduct business and exercise the
power of a limited liability company under this article. The limited
liability company and any of its series may elect to consolidate its
operations as a single taxpayer to the extent required to file
consolidated tax returns as permitted under applicable law and elect to
be treated as a single business for the purposes of qualification or
authorization to do business in this or any other state. Such elections
shall not affect the limitation of liability set forth in this section except
to the extent that the series have specifically accepted joint liability by
contract.
(2) Except as otherwise provided by the Kansas revised limited
liability company act, no member or manager of a series shall be
obligated personally for any debt, obligation or liability of such series,
whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being
a member or acting as manager of such series. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, under an operating agreement or under another
agreement, a member or manager may agree to be obligated personally
for any or all of the debts, obligations and liabilities of one or more
series.
(3) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
members or managers associated with a series having such relative
rights, powers and duties as the operating agreement may provide, and
may make provision for the future creation in the manner provided in
the operating agreement of additional classes or groups of members or
managers associated with such series having such relative rights,
powers and duties as may from time to time be established, including
rights, powers and duties senior to existing classes and groups of
members or managers associated with such series. An operating
agreement may provide for the taking of an action, including the
amendment of the operating agreement, without the vote, consent or
approval of any member or manager or class or group of members or
managers, including an action to create under the provisions of the
operating agreement a class or group of a series of limited liability
company interests that was not previously outstanding. An operating
agreement may provide that any member or class or group of members
associated with a series shall have no voting rights or ability to
otherwise participate in the management or governance of such series,
but any such member or class or group of members are owners of the
series.
(4) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
members or managers or a specified class or group of the members or
managers associated with a series the right to vote separately or with all
or any class or group of the members or managers associated with such
series, on any matter. Voting by members or managers associated with a
series may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or
any other basis.

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 25
(5) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the
management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with
such series in proportion to the then-current percentage or other interest
of members in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
associated with such series, the decision of members owning more than
50% of such percentage or other interest in the profits controlling,
except that if an operating agreement provides for the management of a
series, in whole or in part, by a manager or managers, the management
of such series, to the extent so provided, shall be vested in the manager
or managers who shall be chosen in the manner provided in the
operating agreement. The manager of a series shall also hold the offices
and have the responsibilities accorded to the manager as set forth in an
operating agreement. A series may have more than one manager.
Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,105, and amendments thereto, a manager shall
cease to be a manager with respect to a series as provided in an
operating agreement. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability
company act or in an operating agreement that causes a manager to
cease to be a manager with respect to a series shall not, in itself, cause
such manager to cease to be a manager of the limited liability company
or with respect to any other series thereof.
(6) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,109, and amendments thereto,
but subject to subsections (c)(7) and (c)(10), and unless otherwise
provided in an operating agreement, at the time a member of a series
becomes entitled to receive a distribution with respect to such series,
the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to,
a creditor of such series, with respect to the distribution. An operating
agreement may provide for the establishment of a record date with
respect to allocations and distributions with respect to a series.
(7) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,110(a), and amendments
thereto, a limited liability company may make a distribution with
respect to a series. A limited liability company shall not make a
distribution with respect to a series to a member to the extent that at the
time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all
liabilities of such series, other than liabilities to members on account of
their limited liability company interests with respect to such series and
liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified
property of such series, exceed the fair value of the assets associated
with such series, except that the fair value of property of such series
that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited
shall be included in the assets associated with such series only to the
extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability. For
purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term "distribution"
shall not include amounts constituting reasonable compensation for
present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary
course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other
benefits program. A member who receives a distribution in violation of
this subsection, and who knew at the time of the distribution that the
distribution violated this subsection, shall be liable to the series for the
amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in
violation of this subsection, and who did not know at the time of the
distribution that the distribution violated this subsection, shall not be
liable for the amount of the distribution. Subject to K.S.A. 17-
76,110(c), and amendments thereto, which shall apply to any
distribution made with respect to a series under this subsection, this
subsection shall not affect any obligation or liability of a member under
an agreement or other applicable law for the amount of a distribution.
(8) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a
member shall cease to be associated with a series and to have the power

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 26
to exercise any rights or powers of a member with respect to such
series upon the assignment of all of the member's limited liability
company interest with respect to such series. Except as otherwise
provided in an operating agreement, any event under the Kansas
revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement that
causes a member to cease to be associated with a series shall not, in
itself, cause such member to cease to be associated with any other
series or terminate the continued membership of a member in the
limited liability company or cause the dissolution of the series,
regardless of whether such member was the last remaining member
associated with such series.
(9) Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments thereto, except
to the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series
may be dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the
dissolution of the limited liability company. The dissolution of a series
shall not affect the limitation on liabilities of such series provided by
this subsection (c). A series is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound
up upon the dissolution of the limited liability company under K.S.A.
17-76,116, and amendments thereto, or otherwise upon the first to
occur of the following:
(A) At the time specified in the operating agreement;
(B) upon the happening of events specified in the operating
agreement;
(C) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, upon
the vote, consent or approval of members associated with such series
who own 2/ or more of the then-current percentage or other interest in
3
the profits of such series of the limited liability company owned by all
of the members associated with such series; or
(D) the dissolution of such series under subsection (c)(11).
(10) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,118(a), and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a
manager associated with a series who has not wrongfully dissolved
such series or, if none, the members associated with such series or a
person consented to or approved by the members associated with such
series, in either case, by members who own more than 50% of the then-
current percentage or other interest in the profits of such series owned
by all of the members associated with such series, may wind up the
affairs of such series, but the district court, upon cause shown, may
wind up the affairs of a series upon application of any member or
manager associated with such series, or the member's personal
representative or assignee, and in connection therewith, may appoint a
liquidating trustee. The persons winding up the affairs of a series may,
in the name of the limited liability company and for and on behalf of
the limited liability company and such series, take all actions with
respect to such series as are permitted under K.S.A. 17-76,118(b), and
amendments thereto. The persons winding up the affairs of a series
shall provide for the claims and obligations of such series and distribute
the assets of such series as provided in K.S.A. 17-76,119, and
amendments thereto, which section shall apply to the winding up and
distribution of assets of a series. Actions taken in accordance with this
subsection shall not affect the liability of members and shall not impose
liability on a liquidating trustee.
(11) On application by or for a member or manager associated
with a series, the district court may decree dissolution of such series
whenever it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of
such series in conformity with an operating agreement.
(12) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a series is
an association, regardless of the number of members or managers, if
any, of such series.

HOUSE BILL No. 2371—page 27

company does not contain the term "statutory public benefit limited
liability company," or the abbreviation "S.P.B.L.L.C.," or the
designation "SPBLLC," or words or abbreviations of like import in
other languages if they are written in Roman characters or letters, the
statutory public benefit limited liability company shall, prior to issuing
any limited liability company interest, provide notice to any person to
whom such limited liability company interest is issued that it is a
statutory public benefit limited liability company. Such notice need not
be provided if the issuance is pursuant to an offering registered under

duty to any person on account of any interest of such person in the
public benefit or public benefits set forth in its operating agreement
and articles of organization or on account of any interest materially
affected by the limited liability company's conduct and, with respect to
a decision implicating the balance requirement in subsection (a), will be
deemed to satisfy such person's fiduciary duties to members and the
limited liability company if such person's decision is both informed and
disinterested and not such that no person of ordinary, sound judgment
would approve.

(c) The statement described in subsection (a) shall be based on a
third-party standard. A "third-party standard" means a standard for

public benefits identified in the statutory public benefit limited liability
company's operating agreement or articles of organization that: (1) Is
developed by a person or entity that is independent of the statutory
public benefit limited liability company; and (2) is transparent because
the following information about the standard is publicly available: (A)
The factors considered when measuring the performance of a business;
(B) the relative weightings of those factors; and (C) the identity of the
persons who developed the standard and who control changes to the
standard and the process by which those changes are made. For
purposes of this section, the term "independent" means having no
material relationship with the statutory public benefit limited liability
company or any of its members, managers, affiliates or other persons
with authority to manage or direct the business and affairs of the
statutory public benefit limited liability company.
(d) A statutory public benefit limited liability company shall post
its most recent statement described in subsection (a) on the public
portion of its website, if any, concurrently with the delivery of such
statement to its members under subsection (b). If a statutory public
benefit limited liability company does not have a website, it shall
provide a copy of such statement, without charge, to any person that
requests a copy. Any compensation paid to any person and any other
financial or proprietary information contained in the statement
described in subsection (a) may be omitted from any statement that is
publicly posted or provided to any person pursuant to this subsection,
other than a statement provided to a member, manager or other person
with authority to manage or direct the business and affairs of the
statutory public benefit limited liability company.

statutory public benefit limited liability company may require that the
statutory public benefit limited liability company obtain a periodic
third-party certification addressing the statutory public benefit limited
liability company's promotion of the public benefit or public benefits
identified in the operating agreement or articles of organization or the
best interests of those materially affected by the statutory public benefit
limited liability company's conduct, or both.
