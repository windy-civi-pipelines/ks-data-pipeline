25 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
26 New Section 1. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), without
27 limiting the manner in which any act or transaction may be documented or
28 the manner in which a document may be signed or delivered:
29 (A) Any act or transaction contemplated or governed by the Kansas
30 revised limited liability company act or the operating agreement may be
31 provided for in a document, and an electronic transmission is the
32 equivalent of a written document.
33 (B) Whenever the Kansas revised limited liability company act or the
34 operating agreement requires or permits a signature, the signature may be
35 a manual, facsimile, conformed or electronic signature. "Electronic

HB 2371 2
1 signature" means an electronic symbol or process that is attached to, or
2 logically associated with, a document and executed or adopted by a person
3 with an intent to execute, authenticate or adopt the document. A person
4 may execute a document with such person's signature.
5 (C) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or agreed
6 between the sender and recipient, an electronic transmission is delivered to
7 a person for purposes of the Kansas revised limited liability company act
8 and the operating agreement when it enters an information processing
9 system that the person has designated for the purpose of receiving
10 electronic transmissions of the type delivered if the electronic transmission
11 is in a form capable of being processed by that system and such person is
12 able to retrieve the electronic transmission. Whether a person has so
13 designated an information processing system is determined by the
14 operating agreement or from the context and surrounding circumstances,
15 including the parties' conduct. An electronic transmission is delivered
16 under this section even if no person is aware of its receipt. Receipt of an
17 electronic acknowledgement from an information processing system
18 establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does
19 not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
20 (2) The Kansas revised limited liability company act shall not
21 prohibit one or more persons from conducting a transaction in accordance
22 with the uniform electronic transactions act, K.S.A. 16-601 et seq., and
23 amendments thereto, if the part or parts of the transaction that are
24 governed by the Kansas revised limited liability company act are
25 documented, signed and delivered in accordance with this subsection or
26 otherwise in accordance with the Kansas revised limited liability company
27 act. This subsection shall apply solely for purposes of determining whether
28 an act or transaction has been documented, and the document has been
29 signed and delivered, in accordance with the Kansas revised limited
30 liability company act and the operating agreement.
31 (b) (1) Subsection (a) shall not apply to:
32 (A) A document filed with or submitted to the secretary of state or a
33 court or other judicial or governmental body of this state;
34 (B) a certificate of limited liability company interest, except that a
35 signature on a certificate of limited liability company interest may be
36 manual, facsimile or electronic signature; and
37 (C) an act or transaction effected pursuant to article 79 of chapter 17
38 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or K.S.A. 17-
39 7667, 17-76,130, 17-76,131, 17-76,132 and 17-76,133, and amendments
40 thereto.
41 (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not create any presumption
42 about the lawful means to document a matter addressed by this subsection
43 or the lawful means to sign or deliver a document addressed by this

HB 2371 3
1 subsection. A provision of the operating agreement shall not limit the
2 application of subsection (a) unless the provision expressly restricts one or
3 more of the means of documenting an act or transaction, or of signing or
4 delivering a document, permitted by subsection (a).
5 (c) In the event that any provision of the Kansas revised limited
6 liability company act is deemed to modify, limit or supersede the federal
7 electronic signatures in global and national commerce act, 15 U.S.C. ยง
8 7001 et. seq., the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
9 company act shall control to the fullest extent permitted by 15 U.S.C. ยง

11 (d) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to article 76 of
12 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.

14 subscription for a limited liability company interest, whether submitted in
15 writing, by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
16 applicable law, is irrevocable if the subscription states that such
17 subscription is irrevocable to the extent provided by the terms of the
18 subscription.

20 chapter 17 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.

6 approval would be required to amend the operating agreement, notice of
7 such ratification or waiver shall be given following such ratification or

25 adjudicate the validity and effectiveness of the ratification or waiver. The

7 the surviving or resulting limited liability company or, in addition to or in
8 lieu thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights
9 or securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102,
10 and amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting limited
11 liability company in the merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding,
12 or may be canceled.
13 (3) Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, an agreement of
14 merger or consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a
15 provision for such termination or amendment contained in the agreement
16 of merger or consolidation.
17 (b) The limited liability company surviving or resulting in or from the
18 merger or consolidation shall file a certificate of merger or consolidation
19 executed by one or more authorized persons on behalf of the domestic
20 limited liability company when it is the surviving or resulting entity with
21 the secretary of state. The certificate of merger or consolidation shall state:
22 (1) The name and jurisdiction of formation or organization of each of
23 the limited liability companies which that is to merge or consolidate;
24 (2) that an agreement of merger or consolidation has been consented
25 to or approved and executed by each of the limited liability companies
26 which that is to merge or consolidate;
27 (3) the name of the surviving or resulting limited liability company;
28 (4) in the case of a merger in which a domestic limited liability
29 company is the surviving entity, such amendments, if any, to the articles of
30 organization of the surviving domestic limited liability company to change
31 its name, registered office or resident agent as are desired to be effected by
32 the merger, and such amendments may amend and restate the articles of
33 organization of the surviving domestic limited liability company in its
34 entirety;
35 (5) the future effective date or time, which shall be a date certain, of
36 the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the filing of the

9 proceeding and specifying the address to which a copy of such process
10 shall be mailed to it by the secretary of state.
11 (c) A certificate of merger or consolidation shall act as a certificate of
12 cancellation for a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
13 surviving or resulting limited liability company in the merger or
14 consolidation. A certificate of merger that sets forth any amendment in
15 accordance with subsection (b)(4) shall be deemed to be an amendment to
16 the articles of organization of the limited liability company, and the limited
17 liability company shall not be required to take any further action to amend
18 its articles of organization under K.S.A. 17-7674 or 17-7680, and
19 amendments thereto, with respect to such amendments set forth in the

26 resulting limited liability company in the merger or consolidation, an
27 agreement of merger or consolidation consented to or approved in
28 accordance with subsection (a) may:
29 (1)(A) Effect any amendment to the operating agreement; or
30 (2)(B) effect the adoption of a new operating agreement, for a limited
31 liability company if it is the surviving or resulting limited liability
32 company in the merger or consolidation.
33 (2) Any amendment to an operating agreement or adoption of a new
34 operating agreement made pursuant to the foregoing sentence paragraph
35 (1) shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
36 consolidation and shall be effective notwithstanding any provision of the
37 operating agreement relating to amendment or adoption of a new operating
38 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
39 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
40 agreement, in either case, in connection with a merger or consolidation.
41 The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit the
42 accomplishment of a merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by
43 any other means provided for in an operating agreement or other

HB 2371 13
1 agreement or as otherwise permitted by law, including that the operating
2 agreement of any constituent limited liability company to the merger or
3 consolidation, including a limited liability company formed for the
4 purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the operating
5 agreement of the surviving or resulting limited liability company.
6 (e) When any merger or consolidation shall have become effective
7 under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of
8 the rights, privileges and powers of each of the limited liability companies
9 that have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and
10 mixed, and all debts due to any of the limited liability companies, as well
11 as all other things and causes of action belonging to each of such limited
12 liability companies, shall be vested in the surviving or resulting limited
13 liability company, and shall thereafter be the property of the surviving or
14 resulting limited liability company as they were of each of the limited
15 liability companies that have merged or consolidated, and the title to any
16 real property vested by deed or otherwise, under the laws of the state of
17 Kansas, in any of such limited liability companies, shall not revert or be in
18 any way impaired by reason of this act, but all rights of creditors and all
19 liens upon any property of any of the limited liability companies shall be
20 preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of the
21 limited liability companies that have merged or consolidated shall
22 thenceforth attach to the surviving or resulting limited liability company,
23 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities
24 and duties had been incurred or contracted by it. Unless otherwise agreed,
25 a merger or consolidation of a domestic limited liability company,
26 including a domestic limited liability company which that is not the
27 surviving or resulting entity in the merger or consolidation, shall not
28 require such domestic limited liability company to wind up its affairs
29 under K.S.A. 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and
30 distribute its assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and
31 the merger or consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such
32 limited liability company.
33 (f) A limited liability company may merge or consolidate with or into
34 any other entity in accordance with the business entity transactions act,
35 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto.

4 which the limited liability company or a series of the limited liability
5 company is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation, any division
6 of the limited liability company, or the sale of all or substantially all of the
7 limited liability company's assets. The district court shall have jurisdiction
8 to hear and determine any matter relating to any such appraisal rights
9 provided in an operating agreement or an agreement of merger or
10 consolidation or a plan of division.
11 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 17-7685a is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-

35 or more domestic limited liability companies. The division of a domestic
36 limited liability company in accordance with this section and, if
37 applicable, the resulting cessation of the existence of the dividing company
38 pursuant to a certificate of division shall not be deemed to affect the
39 personal liability of any person incurred prior to such division with respect
40 to matters arising prior to such division, nor shall it be deemed to affect the
41 validity or enforceability of any obligations or liabilities of the dividing
42 company incurred prior to such division;, except that such the obligations
43 and liabilities of the dividing company shall be allocated to and vested in,

HB 2371 15

12 the plan of division shall be adopted in the same manner as is specified in
13 the operating agreement for authorizing a merger or consolidation that
14 involves the limited liability company as a constituent party to the merger
15 or consolidation. If the operating agreement of the dividing company does

19 company, the adoption of a plan of division shall be authorized by the
20 consent or approval of members who own more than 50% of the then-
21 current percentage or other interest in the profits of the dividing company
22 owned by all of the members. Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, a

26 domestic limited liability company pursuant to this section shall not

28 17-76,118, and amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and distribute its
29 assets under K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments thereto, and the division
30 shall not constitute a dissolution of such limited liability company.
31 (e) In connection with a division under this section, rights or
32 securities of, or interests in, the dividing company may be exchanged for
33 or converted into cash, property, rights or securities of, or interests in, the
34 surviving company or any resulting company or, in addition to or in lieu

40 (A) May effect: (i) Any amendment to the operating agreement of the
41 dividing company if it is a surviving company in the division; or (ii) the
42 adoption of a new operating agreement for the dividing company if it is a
43 surviving company in the division; and

HB 2371 16
1 (B) shall effect the adoption of a new an operating agreement for
2 each resulting company.
3 (2) Any amendment to an operating agreement or adoption of a new
4 operating agreement for the dividing company, if it is a surviving company
5 in the division, or adoption of a new an operating agreement for each
6 resulting company made pursuant to this subsection shall be effective at
7 the effective time or date of the division. Any amendment to an operating
8 agreement or adoption of an operating agreement for the dividing
9 company, if it is a surviving company in the division, shall be effective
10 notwithstanding any provision in the operating agreement of the dividing
11 company relating to amendment or adoption of a new operating
12 agreement, other than a provision that by its terms applies to an
13 amendment to the operating agreement or the adoption of a new operating
14 agreement, in either case, in connection with a division, merger or

20 (A) Any conversion or exchange of the limited liability company
21 interests of the dividing company into or for limited liability company
22 interests or other securities or obligations of any division company or cash,

24 defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102, and amendments thereto, that is not a

14 (l) Upon the division of a domestic limited liability company
15 becoming effective:
16 (1) The dividing company shall be subdivided divided into the
17 distinct and independent resulting division companies named in the plan of
18 division, and, if the dividing company is not a surviving company, the
19 existence of the dividing company shall cease.
20 (2) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, all of the
21 rights, privileges and powers, and all the property, real, personal, and
22 mixed, of the dividing company and all debts due on whatever account to

24 shall without further action be allocated to and vested in the applicable
25 division company in such a manner and basis and with such effect as is
26 specified in the plan of division, and the title to any real property or
27 interest therein allocated to and vested in any division company shall not
28 revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the division.
29 (3) Each division company shall, from and after effectiveness of the
30 certificate of division, be liable as a separate and distinct domestic limited
31 liability company for such debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing
32 company as are allocated to such division company pursuant to the plan of
33 division in the manner and on the basis provided in subsection (g)(1)(B).
34 (4) Each of the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company
35 shall without further action be allocated to and be the debts, liabilities and
36 duties of such division company as is specified in the plan of division as
37 having such debts, liabilities and duties allocated to it, in such a manner
38 and basis and with such effect as is specified in the plan of division, and no

HB 2371 20

3 debts, liabilities and duties had originally been incurred or contracted by it
4 in its capacity as a domestic limited liability company.
5 (5) In the event that any allocation of assets, debts, liabilities and
6 duties to division companies in accordance with a plan of division is
7 determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to constitute a fraudulent
8 transfer, each division company shall be jointly and severally liable on
9 account of such fraudulent transfer notwithstanding the allocations made
10 in the plan of division, except that the validity and effectiveness of the
11 division are not otherwise affected thereby.
12 (6) Debts and liabilities of the dividing company that are not
13 allocated by the plan of division shall be the joint and several debts and
14 liabilities of all of the division companies.
15 (7) It shall not be necessary for a plan of division to list each
16 individual asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty of the
17 dividing company to be allocated to a division company so long as the
18 assets, property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties so allocated are
19 reasonably identified by any method where the identity of such assets,
20 property, rights, series, debts, liabilities or duties is objectively
21 determinable.
22 (8) The rights, privileges, powers, and interests in property of the
23 dividing company that have been allocated to a division company, as well
24 as the debts, liabilities and duties of the dividing company that have been
25 allocated to such division company pursuant to a plan of division, shall
26 remain vested in each such division company and shall not be deemed, as
27 a result of the division, to have been assigned or transferred to such
28 division company for any purpose of the laws of the state of Kansas.
29 (9) Any action or proceeding pending against a dividing company
30 may be continued against the surviving company, if any, as if the division
31 did not occur, but subject to paragraph (4), and against any resulting
32 company to which the asset, property, right, series, debt, liability or duty
33 associated with such action or proceeding was allocated pursuant to the
34 plan of division by adding or substituting such resulting company as a
35 party in the action or proceeding.
36 (m) In applying the provisions of the Kansas revised limited liability
37 company act on distributions, a direct or indirect allocation of property or
38 liabilities in a division is not deemed a distribution.
39 (n) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit the
40 means of accomplishing a division by any other means provided for in an
41 operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise permitted by the
42 Kansas revised limited liability company act or as otherwise permitted by

8 by the dividing company to another party, then such restriction, condition
9 or prohibition shall be deemed to apply to a division as if it were a merger,
10 consolidation or transfer of assets, as applicable.

27 time provided in and upon compliance with the operating agreement or, if
28 the operating agreement does not so provide, upon the consent of all
29 members and when the person's admission is reflected in the records of the
30 limited liability company or as otherwise provided in the operating
31 agreement;
32 (2) in the case of an assignee of a limited liability company interest,
33 as provided in subsection (a) of K.S.A. 17-76,114, and amendments
34 thereto, and at the time provided in and upon compliance with the
35 operating agreement or, if the operating agreement does not so provide,
36 when any such person's permitted admission is reflected in the records of
37 the limited liability company; or
38 (3) unless otherwise provided in an agreement of merger or
39 consolidation, in the case of a person acquiring a limited liability company
40 interest in a surviving or resulting limited liability company pursuant to a
41 merger or consolidation approved in accordance with subsection (a) of
42 K.S.A. 17-7681(a), and amendments thereto, at the time provided in and
43 upon compliance with the operating agreement of the surviving or

HB 2371 22

5 consolidation, as provided in the operating agreement of such limited
6 liability company; or
7 (4) in the case of a person being admitted as a member of a division

11 event of any inconsistency, the terms of the plan of division shall control;
12 and in the case of a person being admitted as a member of a limited
13 liability company pursuant to a division in which such limited liability
14 company is not a division company in the division, as provided in the
15 operating agreement of such limited liability company.
16 (c) A person may be admitted to a limited liability company as a
17 member of the limited liability company and may receive a limited
18 liability company interest in the limited liability company without making
19 a contribution or being obligated to make a contribution to the limited
20 liability company. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
21 person may be admitted to a limited liability company as a member of the
22 limited liability company without acquiring a limited liability company
23 interest in the limited liability company. Unless otherwise provided in an
24 operating agreement, a person may be admitted as the sole member of a
25 limited liability company without making a contribution or being obligated
26 to make a contribution to the limited liability company or without
27 acquiring a limited liability company interest in the limited liability

29 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement or another
30 agreement, a member shall have no preemptive right to subscribe to any
31 additional issue of limited liability company interests or another interest in
32 a limited liability company.
33 Sec. 11. K.S.A. 17-7687 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
34 7687. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
35 members having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
36 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
37 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
38 groups of members having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
39 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
40 senior to existing classes and groups of members. An operating agreement
41 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
42 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any member
43 or class or group of members, including an action to create under the

HB 2371 23
1 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability
2 company interests that was not previously outstanding. An operating
3 agreement may provide that any member or class or group of members
4 shall have no voting rights.
5 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
6 members or a specified class or group of the members the right to vote
7 separately or with all or any class or group of the members or managers,
8 on any matter. Voting by members may be on a per capita, number,
9 financial interest, class, group or any other basis.
10 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
11 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
12 voted on by any members, waiver of any such notice, action by consent or
13 approval without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum
14 requirements, voting in person or by proxy, or any other matter with
15 respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.
16 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
17 members may be held by means of conference telephone or other
18 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
19 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
20 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
21 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
22 voted on, consented to or approved by members, the members may take
23 such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if
24 consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or by any
25 other means permitted by law, by members having not less than the
26 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
27 such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote thereon
28 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
29 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a member, consents to or
30 approves as a member any matter and provides that such consent or
31 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
32 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
33 consented or approved as a member at such future time so long as such
34 person is then a member. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
35 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by members, the members
36 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
37 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
38 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
39 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a member or
40 by a person or persons authorized to act for a member shall be deemed to
41 be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of this
42 subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
43 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,

HB 2371 24
1 including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks
2 or databases, including one or more distributed electronic networks or
3 databases, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and
4 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
5 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
6 (e) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement or in the
7 Kansas revised limited liability company act, every member holding an
8 interest in profits shall be entitled to vote.
9 (f) If an operating agreement provides for the manner in which it may
10 be amended, including by requiring the approval or consent of a person
11 who is not a party to the operating agreement or the satisfaction of
12 conditions, it may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise
13 permitted by law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and
14 amendments thereto, provided that the approval or consent of any person
15 may be waived by such person and that any such conditions may be
16 waived by all persons for whose benefit such conditions were intended.
17 Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a supermajority
18 amendment provision shall only apply to provisions of the operating
19 agreement that are expressly included in the operating agreement. As used
20 in this section, "supermajority amendment provision" means any
21 amendment provision set forth in an operating agreement requiring that an
22 amendment to a provision of the operating agreement be adopted by no
23 less than the vote or consent or approval required to take action under such
24 latter provision.
25 (g) If an operating agreement does not provide for the manner in
26 which it may be amended, the operating agreement may be amended with
27 the approval or consent of all of the members or as otherwise permitted by
28 law, including as permitted by K.S.A. 17-7681(e)(d), and amendments
29 thereto. This subsection shall only apply to a limited liability company
30 whose original articles of organization were filed with the secretary of
31 state on or after July 1, 2014.
32 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 17-7690 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
33 7690. (a) Each member of a limited liability company, in person or by
34 attorney or other agent, has the right, subject to such reasonable standards,
35 including standards governing what information, including books, records
36 and other documents are, is to be furnished at what time and location and
37 at whose expense, as may be set forth in an operating agreement or
38 otherwise established by the manager or, if there is no manager, then by
39 the members, to obtain from the limited liability company from time to
40 time upon reasonable demand for any purpose reasonably related to the
41 member's interest as a member of the limited liability company:
42 (1) True and full information regarding the status of the business and
43 financial condition of the limited liability company;

HB 2371 25
1 (2) promptly after becoming available, a copy of the limited liability
2 company's federal, state and local income tax returns for each year;
3 (3) a current list of the name and last known business, residence or
4 mailing address of each member and manager;
5 (4) a copy of any written operating agreement and articles of
6 organization and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of
7 any written powers of attorney pursuant to which the operating agreement
8 and any certificate and all amendments thereto have been executed;
9 (5) true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
10 description and statement of the agreed value of any other property or
11 services contributed by each member and which each member has agreed
12 to contribute in the future, and the date on which each became a member;
13 and
14 (6) other information regarding the affairs of the limited liability
15 company as is just and reasonable.
16 (b) Each manager shall have the right to examine all of the
17 information described in subsection (a) for a purpose reasonably related to
18 the position of manager.
19 (c) The manager of a limited liability company shall have the right to
20 keep confidential from the members, for such period of time as the
21 manager deems reasonable, any information which that the manager
22 reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information
23 the disclosure of which the manager in good faith believes is not in the
24 best interest of the limited liability company or could damage the limited
25 liability company or its business or which the limited liability company is
26 required by law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
27 (d) A limited liability company may maintain its books, records and
28 other documents in other than a written paper form, including on, by
29 means of, or in the form of any information storage device, method, or one
30 or more electronic networks or databases, including one or more
31 distributed electronic networks or databases, if such form is capable of
32 conversion into written paper form within a reasonable time.
33 (e) Any demand under this section shall be in writing and shall state
34 the purpose of such demand. In every instance where an attorney or other
35 agent is the person who seeks the right to obtain the information described
36 in subsection (a), the demand shall be accompanied by a power of attorney
37 or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act
38 on behalf of the member.
39 (f) Any action to enforce any right arising under this section shall be
40 brought in the district court. If the limited liability company refuses to
41 permit a member, or attorney or other agent acting for the member, to
42 obtain or a manager to examine the information described in subsection (a)
43 or does not reply to the demand that has been made within five business

HB 2371 26
1 days, or such shorter or longer period of time as is provided for in an
2 operating agreement, but not longer than 30 business days, after the
3 demand has been made, the demanding member or manager may apply to
4 the district court for an order to compel such disclosure. The district court
5 may summarily order the limited liability company to permit the
6 demanding member to obtain or manager to examine the information
7 described in subsection (a) and to make copies or abstracts therefrom, or
8 the district court may summarily order the limited liability company to
9 furnish to the demanding member or manager the information described in
10 subsection (a) on the condition that the demanding member or manager
11 first pay to the limited liability company the reasonable cost of obtaining
12 and furnishing such information and on such other conditions as the
13 district court deems appropriate. When a demanding member seeks to
14 obtain or a manager seeks to examine the information described in
15 subsection (a), the demanding member or manager shall first establish: (1)
16 That the demanding member or manager has complied with the provisions
17 of this section respecting the form and manner of making demand for
18 obtaining or examining of such information; and (2) that the information
19 the demanding member or manager seeks is reasonably related to the
20 member's interest as a member or the manager's position as a manager, as
21 the case may be. The district court may, in its discretion, prescribe any
22 limitations or conditions with reference to the obtaining or examining of
23 information, or award such other or further relief as the district court may
24 deem just and proper. The district court may order books, documents and
25 records and other documents, pertinent extracts therefrom, or duly
26 authenticated copies thereof, to be brought within the state of Kansas and
27 kept in the state of Kansas upon such terms and conditions as the order
28 may prescribe.
29 (g) If a member is entitled to obtain information under the Kansas
30 revised limited liability company act or an operating agreement for a
31 purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member or other
32 stated purpose, the member's right shall be to obtain such information as
33 is necessary and essential to achieving that purpose. The rights of a
34 member or manager to obtain or examine information as provided in this
35 section may be expanded or restricted in an original operating agreement
36 or in any subsequent amendment consented to, approved or adopted by all
37 of the members or in compliance with any applicable requirements of the
38 operating agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not be
39 construed to limit the ability to impose restrictions on expand or restrict
40 the rights of a member or manager to obtain or examine information by
41 any other means permitted under the Kansas revised limited liability
42 company act by law.
43 (h) A limited liability company shall maintain a current record that

HB 2371 27
1 identifies the name and last known business, residence, or mailing address
2 of each member and manager.
3 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 17-7695 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
4 7695. (a) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of
5 managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as the operating
6 agreement may provide, and may make provision for the future creation in
7 the manner provided in the operating agreement of additional classes or
8 groups of managers having such relative rights, powers and duties as may
9 from time to time be established, including rights, powers and duties
10 senior to existing classes and groups of managers. An operating agreement
11 may provide for the taking of an action, including the amendment of the
12 operating agreement, without the vote, consent or approval of any manager
13 or class or group of managers, including an action to create under the
14 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of limited liability
15 company interests that was not previously outstanding.
16 (b) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
17 managers or a specified class or group of the managers the right to vote,
18 separately or with all or any class or group of managers or members, on
19 any matter. Voting by managers may be on a per capita, number, financial
20 interest, class, group or any other basis. Unless otherwise provided in an
21 operating agreement, if more than one manager is appointed, all managers
22 shall have an equal vote per capita.
23 (c) An operating agreement may set forth provisions relating to notice
24 of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be
25 voted on by any manager or class or group of managers, waiver of any
26 such notice, action by consent or approval without a meeting, the
27 establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or
28 by proxy, or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right
29 to vote.
30 (d) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, meetings of
31 managers may be held by means of conference telephone or other
32 communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in
33 the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to
34 this subsection shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Unless
35 otherwise provided in an operating agreement, on any matter that is to be
36 voted on, consented to or approved by the managers, the managers may
37 take such action without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
38 vote, if consented to or approved, in writing, by electronic transmission, or
39 by any other means permitted by law, by managers having not less than the
40 minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
41 such action at a meeting at which all managers entitled to vote thereon
42 were present and voted. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
43 agreement, if a person, whether or not then a manager, consents to or

HB 2371 28
1 approves as a manager any matter and provides that such consent or
2 approval will be effective at a future time, including a time determined
3 upon the happening of an event, then such person shall be deemed to have
4 consented or approved as a manager at such future time, so long as such
5 person is then a manager. Unless otherwise provided in an operating
6 agreement, on any matter that is to be voted on by managers, the managers
7 may vote in person or by proxy, and such proxy may be granted in writing,
8 by means of electronic transmission or as otherwise permitted by
9 applicable law. Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, a
10 consent or approval transmitted by electronic transmission by a manager
11 or by a person or persons authorized to act for a manager shall be deemed
12 to be written and signed for purposes of this subsection. For purposes of
13 this subsection, the term "electronic transmission" means any form of
14 communication not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
15 including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks
16 or databases, including one or more distributed electronic networks or
17 databases, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and
18 reviewed by a recipient thereof and that may be directly reproduced in
19 paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
20 Sec. 14. K.S.A. 17-7698 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
21 7698. Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member or
22 manager of a limited liability company has the power and authority to
23 delegate to one or more other persons any or all of the member's or
24 manager's, as the case may be, rights, powers and duties to manage and
25 control the business and affairs of the limited liability company. Any such
26 delegation may be made irrespective of whether the member or manager
27 has a conflict of interest with respect to the matter as to which its rights,
28 powers or duties are being delegated, and the person or persons to whom
29 any such rights, powers or duties are being delegated shall not be deemed
30 conflicted solely by reason of the conflict of interest of the member or
31 manager. Any such delegation may be to agents, officers and employees
32 of a member or manager or the limited liability company, and by a
33 management agreement or another agreement with, or otherwise to, other
34 persons, including a committee of one or more persons. Unless otherwise
35 provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a member or
36 manager shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable. Unless
37 otherwise provided in the operating agreement, such delegation by a
38 member or manager of a limited liability company shall not cause the
39 member or manager to cease to be a member or manager, as the case may
40 be, of the limited liability company or cause the person to whom any such
41 rights, powers and duties have been delegated to be a member or manager,
42 as the case may be, of the limited liability company. No other provision of
43 the Kansas revised limited liability company act or other law shall be

HB 2371 29
1 construed to restrict a member's or manager's power and authority to
2 delegate any or all of its rights, powers, and duties to manage and control
3 the business and affairs of the limited liability company.
4 Sec. 15. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 17-76,136 is hereby amended to read as
5 follows: 17-76,136. (a) The secretary of state shall charge each domestic
6 and foreign limited liability company the following fees:
7 (1) A fee of $20 for issuing or filing and indexing any of the
8 following documents:
9 (A) A certificate of amendment of articles of organization;
10 (B) restated articles of organization;

13 of cancellation;
14 (D) a certificate of change of location of registered office or resident
15 agent;
16 (E) a certificate of merger or consolidation;
17 (F) a certificate of division; and
18 (G) any certificate, affidavit, agreement or any other paper provided
19 for in the Kansas revised limited liability company act, for which no
20 different fee is specifically prescribed;
21 (2) a fee of $7.50 for each certified copy, regardless of whether the
22 secretary of state supplies the copy;
23 (3) a fee of $7.50 for each certificate of good standing, including a
24 certificate of good standing for a series of a limited liability company,
25 issued by the secretary of state; and
26 (4) a fee of $20 for a copy of an instrument on file or prepared by the
27 secretary of state's office, whether or not the copy is certified.
28 (b) Every limited liability company hereafter formed in this state shall
29 pay to the secretary of state, at the time of filing its articles of organization,
30 an application and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of
31 the secretary of state, except that such fee shall not exceed $150.
32 (c) At the time of filing its application to do business, every foreign
33 limited liability company shall pay to the secretary of state an application
34 and recording fee of established by rules and regulations of the secretary

36 (d) The fee for filing a certificate of reinstatement shall be the same
37 as that prescribed by K.S.A. 17-7506, and amendments thereto, for filing a
38 certificate of reinstatement of a corporation's articles of incorporation.
39 Sec. 16. K.S.A. 17-76,143 is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
40 76,143. (a) An operating agreement may establish or provide for the
41 establishment of one or more designated series of members, managers,
42 limited liability company interests or assets. If an operating agreement so
43 provides for the establishment or formation of one or more series, then a

HB 2371 30
1 series may be formed by complying with this section. Any such series may
2 have separate rights, powers or duties with respect to specified property or
3 obligations of the limited liability company or profits and losses associated
4 with specified property or obligations, and to the extent provided in the
5 operating agreement, any such series may have a separate business
6 purpose or investment objective. A series is formed by the filing of a
7 certificate of designation in the office of the secretary of state. Other than
8 pursuant to K.S.A. 17-76,143a, and amendments thereto, a series may not
9 merge, convert, or consolidate pursuant to any section of the Kansas
10 revised limited liability company act, the business entity transactions act,
11 K.S.A. 17-78-101 et seq., and amendments thereto, or any other statute of
12 this state.
13 (b) Notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in
14 subsection (c) shall be set forth in the articles of organization of the limited
15 liability company. Notice in articles of organization of the limitation on
16 liabilities of a series as referenced in subsection (c) shall be sufficient for
17 all purposes of this subsection whether or not the limited liability company
18 has formed any series when such notice is included in the articles of
19 organization, and there shall be no requirement that any specific series of
20 the limited liability company be referenced in such notice. The fact that
21 articles of organization that contain the foregoing notice of the limitation
22 on liabilities of a series is on file in the office of the secretary of state shall
23 constitute notice of such limitation on liabilities of a series.
24 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Kansas
25 revised limited liability company act or under other applicable law, in the
26 event that an operating agreement establishes or provides for the
27 establishment of one or more series, and if to the extent the records
28 maintained for any series account for the assets associated with such series
29 separately from the other assets of the limited liability company, or any
30 other series thereof, and if the operating agreement so provides, and if
31 notice of the limitation on liabilities of a series as referenced in this
32 subsection is set forth in the articles of organization of the limited liability
33 company and if the limited liability company has filed a certificate of
34 designation for each series which that is to have limited liability under this
35 section, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred,
36 contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to such series shall be
37 enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets
38 of the limited liability company generally or any other series thereof, and,
39 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, none of the debts,
40 liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise
41 existing with respect to the limited liability company generally or any
42 other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such series.
43 Neither the preceding sentences nor any provision pursuant thereto in an

HB 2371 31
1 operating agreement, articles of organization or certificate of designation
2 shall: Restrict a series or limited liability company on behalf of a series
3 from agreeing in the operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of
4 the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or
5 otherwise existing with respect to the limited liability company generally
6 or any other series thereof shall be enforceable against the assets of such
7 series; or restrict a limited liability company from agreeing in the
8 operating agreement or otherwise that any or all of the debts, liabilities,
9 obligations, and expenses incurred, contracted for, or otherwise existing
10 with respect to a series shall be enforceable against the assets of the
11 limited liability company generally. Assets associated with a series may be
12 held directly or indirectly, including in the name of such series, in the
13 name of the limited liability company, through a nominee or otherwise.
14 Records maintained for a series that reasonably identify its assets,
15 including by specific listing, category, type, quantity, computational, or
16 allocational formula or procedure, including a percentage or share of any
17 asset or assets, or by any other method where the identity of such assets is
18 objectively determinable, will be deemed to account for the assets
19 associated with such series separately from the other assets of the limited
20 liability company, or any other series thereof. As used in the Kansas
21 revised limited liability company act, a reference to assets of a series
22 includes assets associated with such series, a reference to assets associated
23 with a series includes assets of such series, a reference to members or
24 managers of a series includes members or managers associated with such
25 series, and a reference to members or managers associated with a series
26 includes members or managers of such series. The following shall apply to
27 a series:
28 (1) A series may carry on any lawful business, purpose or activity,
29 whether or not for profit, with the exception of the business of granting
30 policies of insurance, assuming insurance risks, or banking as defined in
31 K.S.A. 9-702, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise provided in an
32 operating agreement, a series shall have the power and capacity to, in its
33 own name, contract, hold title to assets, including real, personal, and
34 intangible property, grant liens and security interests, and sue and be sued.
35 (2) Except as otherwise provided by the Kansas revised limited
36 liability company act, no member or manager of a series shall be obligated
37 personally for any debt, obligation or liability of such series, whether
38 arising in contract, tort or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member
39 or acting as manager of such series. Notwithstanding the preceding
40 sentence, under an operating agreement or under another agreement, a
41 member or manager may agree to be obligated personally for any or all of
42 the debts, obligations and liabilities of one or more series.
43 (3) An operating agreement may provide for classes or groups of

HB 2371 32
1 members or managers associated with a series having such relative rights,
2 powers and duties as the operating agreement may provide, and may make
3 provision for the future creation in the manner provided in the operating
4 agreement of additional classes or groups of members or managers
5 associated with such series having such relative rights, powers and duties
6 as may from time to time be established, including rights, powers and
7 duties senior to existing classes and groups of members or managers
8 associated with such series. An operating agreement may provide for the
9 taking of an action, including the amendment of the operating agreement,
10 without the vote, consent or approval of any member or manager or class
11 or group of members or managers, including an action to create under the
12 provisions of the operating agreement a class or group of a series of
13 limited liability company interests that was not previously outstanding. An
14 operating agreement may provide that any member or class or group of
15 members associated with a series shall have no voting rights.
16 (4) An operating agreement may grant to all or certain identified
17 members or managers or a specified class or group of the members or
18 managers associated with a series the right to vote separately or with all or
19 any class or group of the members or managers associated with such
20 series, on any matter. Voting by members or managers associated with a
21 series may be on a per capita, number, financial interest, class, group or
22 any other basis.
23 (5) Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, the
24 management of a series shall be vested in the members associated with
25 such series in proportion to the then-current percentage or other interest of
26 members in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
27 associated with such series, the decision of members owning more than
28 50% of such percentage or other interest in the profits controlling, except
29 that if an operating agreement provides for the management of a series, in
30 whole or in part, by a manager, the management of such series, to the
31 extent so provided, shall be vested in the manager who shall be chosen in
32 the manner provided in the operating agreement. The manager of a series
33 shall also hold the offices and have the responsibilities accorded to the
34 manager as set forth in an operating agreement. A series may have more
35 than one manager. Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,105, and amendments thereto,
36 a manager shall cease to be a manager with respect to a series as provided
37 in an operating agreement. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
38 agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability company
39 act or in an operating agreement that causes a manager to cease to be a
40 manager with respect to a series shall not, in itself, cause such manager to
41 cease to be a manager of the limited liability company or with respect to
42 any other series thereof.
43 (6) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,109, and amendments thereto, but

HB 2371 33
1 subject to subsections (c)(7) and (c)(10), and unless otherwise provided in
2 an operating agreement, at the time a member of a series becomes entitled
3 to receive a distribution with respect to such series, the member has the
4 status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of such
5 series, with respect to the distribution. An operating agreement may
6 provide for the establishment of a record date with respect to allocations
7 and distributions with respect to a series.
8 (7) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,110(a), and amendments thereto, a
9 limited liability company may make a distribution with respect to a series.
10 A limited liability company shall not make a distribution with respect to a
11 series to a member to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after
12 giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of such series, other than
13 liabilities to members on account of their limited liability company
14 interests with respect to such series and liabilities for which the recourse of
15 creditors is limited to specified property of such series, exceed the fair
16 value of the assets associated with such series, except that the fair value of
17 property of such series that is subject to a liability for which the recourse
18 of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets associated with such
19 series only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that
20 liability. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
21 "distribution" shall not include amounts constituting reasonable
22 compensation for present or past services or reasonable payments made in
23 the ordinary course of business pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or
24 other benefits program. A member who receives a distribution in violation
25 of this subsection, and who knew at the time of the distribution that the
26 distribution violated this subsection, shall be liable to the series for the
27 amount of the distribution. A member who receives a distribution in
28 violation of this subsection, and who did not know at the time of the
29 distribution that the distribution violated this subsection, shall not be liable
30 for the amount of the distribution. Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,110(c), and
31 amendments thereto, which shall apply to any distribution made with
32 respect to a series under this subsection, this subsection shall not affect any
33 obligation or liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable
34 law for the amount of a distribution.
35 (8) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member
36 shall cease to be associated with a series and to have the power to exercise
37 any rights or powers of a member with respect to such series upon the
38 assignment of all of the member's limited liability company interest with
39 respect to such series. Except as otherwise provided in an operating
40 agreement, any event under the Kansas revised limited liability company
41 act or an operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be
42 associated with a series shall not, in itself, cause such member to cease to
43 be associated with any other series or terminate the continued membership

HB 2371 34
1 of a member in the limited liability company or cause the dissolution of
2 the series, regardless of whether such member was the last remaining
3 member associated with such series.
4 (9) Subject to K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments thereto, except to
5 the extent otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a series may be
6 dissolved and its affairs wound up without causing the dissolution of the
7 limited liability company. The dissolution of a series shall not affect the
8 limitation on liabilities of such series provided by this subsection (c). A
9 series is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the dissolution of
10 the limited liability company under K.S.A. 17-76,116, and amendments
11 thereto, or otherwise upon the first to occur of the following:
12 (A) At the time specified in the operating agreement;
13 (B) upon the happening of events specified in the operating
14 agreement;
15 (C) unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, upon the
16 vote, consent or approval of members associated with such series who own
17 2/ or more of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of
3
18 such series of the limited liability company owned by all of the members
19 associated with such series; or
20 (D) the dissolution of such series under subsection (c)(11).
21 (10) Notwithstanding K.S.A. 17-76,118(a), and amendments thereto,
22 unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a manager
23 associated with a series who has not wrongfully dissolved such series or, if
24 none, the members associated with such series or a person consented to or
25 approved by the members associated with such series, in either case, by
26 members who own more than 50% of the then-current percentage or other
27 interest in the profits of such series owned by all of the members
28 associated with such series, may wind up the affairs of such series, but the
29 district court, upon cause shown, may wind up the affairs of a series upon
30 application of any member or manager associated with such series, or the
31 member's personal representative or assignee, and in connection therewith,
32 may appoint a liquidating trustee. The persons winding up the affairs of a
33 series may, in the name of the limited liability company and for and on
34 behalf of the limited liability company and such series, take all actions
35 with respect to such series as are permitted under K.S.A. 17-76,118(b), and
36 amendments thereto. The persons winding up the affairs of a series shall
37 provide for the claims and obligations of such series and distribute the
38 assets of such series as provided in K.S.A. 17-76,119, and amendments
39 thereto, which section shall apply to the winding up and distribution of
40 assets of a series. Actions taken in accordance with this subsection shall
41 not affect the liability of members and shall not impose liability on a
42 liquidating trustee.
43 (11) On application by or for a member or manager associated with a

HB 2371 35
1 series, the district court may decree dissolution of such series whenever it
2 is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of such series in
3 conformity with an operating agreement.
4 (12) For all purposes of the laws of the state of Kansas, a series is an
5 association, regardless of the number of members or managers, if any, of
6 such series.
7 (d) In order to form a series of a limited liability company, a
8 certificate of designation must be filed in accordance with this subsection.
9 (1) (A) A certificate of designation shall set forth:
10 (i) The name of the limited liability company; and

34 of a series who becomes aware that any statement in a certificate of
35 designation filed with respect to such series was false when made, or that

37 designation false in any material respect or noncompliant with subsection
38 (e)(1), shall promptly amend the certificate of designation.

18 thereto.
19 (3) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to limit
20 the accomplishment of a revocation of dissolution of a series by other
21 means permitted by law.
22 Sec. 17. K.S.A. 17-76,143a is hereby amended to read as follows: 17-
23 76,143a. (a) Pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, one or
24 more series may merge or consolidate with or into one or more other series
25 of the same limited liability company with such series as the agreement
26 shall provide being the surviving or resulting series. Unless otherwise
27 provided in the operating agreement, an agreement of merger or
28 consolidation shall be consented to or approved by each series that is to
29 merge or consolidate by members of such series who own more than 50%
30 of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of such series
31 owned by all of the members of such series. In connection with a merger
32 or consolidation hereunder, rights or securities of, or interests in, a series
33 which that is a constituent party to the merger or consolidation may be
34 exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights, or securities of, or
35 interests in, the surviving or resulting series or, in addition to or in lieu
36 thereof, may be exchanged for or converted into cash, property, rights, or
37 securities of, or interests in, an entity as defined in K.S.A. 17-78-102, and
38 amendments thereto, that is not the surviving or resulting series in the
39 merger or consolidation, may remain outstanding or may be canceled.
40 Notwithstanding prior consent or approval, an agreement of merger or
41 consolidation may be terminated or amended pursuant to a provision for
42 such termination or amendment contained in the agreement of merger or
43 consolidation.

HB 2371 39
1 (b) If a series is merging or consolidating under this section, the
2 series surviving or resulting in or from the merger or consolidation shall
3 file a certificate of merger or consolidation of series executed by one or
4 more authorized persons on behalf of the series when it is the surviving or
5 resulting series in the office of the secretary of state. The certificate of
6 merger or consolidation of series shall state:
7 (1) The name of each series that is to merge or consolidate and the
8 name of the limited liability company that formed such series;
9 (2) that an agreement of merger or consolidation has been consented
10 to or approved and executed by or on behalf of each series that is to merge
11 or consolidate;
12 (3) the name of the surviving or resulting series;
13 (4) such amendment amendments, if any, to the certificate of
14 designation of the series that is the surviving or resulting series to change
15 the name of the surviving series, as is are desired to be effected by the
16 merger, and such amendments may amend and restate the certificate of
17 designation of the surviving series in its enirety;
18 (5) the future effective date or time, which shall be a date or time
19 certain, of the merger or consolidation if it is not to be effective upon the
20 filing of the certificate of merger or consolidation;

22 of business of the surviving or resulting series or the limited liability
23 company that formed such series and shall state the address thereof; and
24 (7) that a copy of the agreement of merger or consolidation will be
25 furnished by the surviving or resulting series, upon request and without
26 cost, to any member of any series that is to merge or consolidate.
27 (c) Unless a future effective date or time is provided in a certificate of
28 merger or consolidation, a merger or consolidation of series pursuant to
29 this section shall be effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger or
30 consolidation of series in the office of the secretary of state.
31 (d) A certificate of merger or consolidation of series shall act as a
32 certificate of cancellation of the certificate of designation of the series that
33 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation. A
34 certificate of merger or consolidation of series that sets forth any
35 amendment in accordance with subsection (b)(4) shall be deemed to be an
36 amendment to the certificate of designation of the surviving or resulting
37 series, and no further action shall be required to amend the certificate of
38 designation of the surviving or resulting series under K.S.A. 17-76,143,
39 and amendments thereto, with respect to such amendments set forth in the
40 such certificate of merger or consolidation of series. Whenever this section
41 requires the filing of a certificate of merger or consolidation of series, such
42 requirement shall be deemed satisfied by the filing of an agreement of
43 merger or consolidation containing the information required by this section

HB 2371 40
1 to be set forth in the such certificate of merger or consolidation.
2 (e) An agreement of merger or consolidation consented to or
3 approved in accordance with subsection (a) may effect any amendment to
4 the operating agreement relating solely to the series that are constituent
5 parties to the merger or consolidation. Any amendment to an operating
6 agreement relating solely to the series that are constituent parties to the
7 merger or consolidation made pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be
8 effective at the effective time or date of the merger or consolidation and
9 shall be effective notwithstanding any provision of the operating
10 agreement relating to amendment of the operating agreement, other than a
11 provision that by its terms applies to an amendment to the operating
12 agreement in connection with a merger or consolidation. The provisions of
13 this subsection shall not be construed to limit the accomplishment of a
14 merger or of any of the matters referred to herein by any other means
15 provided for in an operating agreement or other agreement or as otherwise
16 permitted by law, including that the operating agreement relating to any
17 constituent series to the merger or consolidation, including a series formed
18 for the purpose of consummating a merger or consolidation, shall be the
19 operating agreement of the surviving or resulting series.
20 (f) (1) (A) When any merger or consolidation shall have become
21 effective under this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of
22 Kansas, all of the rights, privileges and powers of each of the series that
23 have merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
24 and all debts due to any of such series, as well as all other things and
25 causes of action belonging to each of such series, shall be vested in the
26 surviving or resulting series, and shall thereafter be the property of the
27 surviving or resulting series as they were of each of the series that have
28 merged or consolidated, and the title to any real property vested by deed or
29 otherwise, under the laws of the state of Kansas, in any of such series,
30 shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Kansas revised
31 limited liability company act.
32 (B) All rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of
33 the series that have merged or consolidated shall be preserved unimpaired,
34 and all debts, liabilities and duties of each of such series that have merged
35 or consolidated shall thereafter attach to the surviving or resulting series,
36 and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if such debts,
37 liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.
38 (2) Unless otherwise agreed, a merger or consolidation of a series that
39 is not the surviving or resulting series in the merger or consolidation, shall
40 not require such series to wind up its affairs under K.S.A. 17-76,143, and
41 amendments thereto, or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets under
42 K.S.A. 17-76,143, and amendments thereto, and the merger or
43 consolidation shall not constitute a dissolution of such series.

HB 2371 41
1 (g) An operating agreement may provide that a series of such limited
2 liability company shall not have the power to merge or consolidate as set
3 forth in this section.
4 (h) This section shall take effect on and after July 1, 2020.

10 76,116(a)(1) through (a)(4), and amendments thereto, the limited liability
11 company shall not be dissolved and its affairs shall not be wound up if,
12 prior to the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the secretary of state,
13 the limited liability company is continued, effective as of the occurrence of
14 such event:
15 (1) In the case of dissolution effected by the vote, consent or approval
16 of the members, or other persons whose vote, consent or approval is

4 of a nominee or designee as a member, effective as of the occurrence of
5 the event that terminated the continued membership of the last remaining
6 member.

23 does not contain the term "statutory public benefit limited liability
24 company," or the abbreviation "S.P.B.L.L.C.," or the designation

13 business and affairs of the statutory public benefit limited liability
14 company.
