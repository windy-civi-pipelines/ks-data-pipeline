25 the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers
26 for fiscal year 2024.
27 (5) "Excess fiscal year general revenue fund collections" means the

32 the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers
33 for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
HB 2318—Am. by HCW 2
1 (7) "Inflation adjusted base year revenues" means the base year
2 revenues multiplied by the adjusted consumer price ratio.
3 (b) Commencing on August 15, 2025, and every August 15 thereafter,
4 the director of the budget, in consultation with the director of legislative
5 research, shall determine whether the total fiscal year adjusted general
6 revenue fund collections from the immediately preceding fiscal year are in
7 excess of the inflation adjusted base year revenues {and if the amount of
8 moneys in the budget stabilization fund established pursuant to K.S.A.
9 75-6706, and amendments thereto, is equal to or exceeds 20% of the
10 prior fiscal year's state tax receipt revenues to the state general fund}.
11 If the total fiscal year adjusted general revenue fund collections from the
12 immediately preceding fiscal year are in excess of the inflation adjusted
13 base year revenues {and the amount of moneys in the budget
14 stabilization fund is equal to or exceeds 20% of the prior fiscal year's
15 state tax receipt revenues to the state general fund}, the director of the
16 budget shall certify to the secretary of revenue the existence of such excess
17 and the amount of the excess.
18 (c) In the event that the secretary of revenue certifies that the adjusted
19 general revenue fund collections from the immediately preceding fiscal
20 year are in excess of the inflation adjusted base year revenues {and the
21 amount of moneys in the budget stabilization fund is equal to or
22 exceeds 20% of the prior fiscal year's state tax receipt revenues to the
23 state general fund}, the secretary shall calculate and publish the income
24 tax and privilege tax rate reduction as a result of the excess. In calculating
25 the income tax rate reduction, the excess fiscal year general revenue fund
26 collections shall be computed that would result in the reduction of the
27 income tax rates pursuant to subsection (d) in an amount approximately
28 equal to the rate reductions down to the nearest 0.01% to go into effect for
29 the next tax year. In calculating the privilege tax rate reduction
30 pursuant to subsection (d), the reduction shall be a corresponding rate
31 reduction that is equal to the total percentage adjustment to the
32 corporate income tax. Such rate reductions shall remain in effect unless
33 further reduced pursuant to this section. The income tax brackets and
34 taxable income thresholds prescribed in K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and
35 amendments thereto, shall be adjusted to reflect the changes in income tax
36 rates.
37 (d) The secretary shall first compute the reduction of the income tax
38 rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto, that
39 decreases proportionally all tax rates in effect. Once the lower income tax
40 rate is decreased to 4.5% {4%}, there shall be no further reductions to the
41 lower income tax rate and further reductions shall only be applied to
42 reduce the higher income tax rate in effect. Upon the higher income tax
43 rate being decreased to 4.5% {4%}, no further reductions shall occur to
HB 2318—Am. by HCW 3
1 K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto. The secretary shall then
2 compute decreases to:
3 (1) The surtax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and
4 amendments thereto. The surtax shall be decreased until the combined
5 normal and surtax rates equal 4.5% {4%} that are imposed pursuant to
6 K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto. Once the combined normal
7 and surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto,
8 equal 4.5% {4%}, no further reductions shall occur;
9 (2) the normal tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1107, and
10 amendments thereto. The normal tax shall be decreased until the
11 combined normal and surtax rates equal 2.82% {2.6%} that are
12 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1107, and amendments thereto. Once
13 the combined normal and surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1107,
14 and amendments thereto, equal 2.82% {2.6%}, no further reductions
15 shall occur; and
16 (3) the normal tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1108, and
17 amendments thereto. The normal tax shall be decreased until the
18 combined normal and surtax rates equal 2.90% {2.62%} that are
19 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1108, and amendments thereto. Once
20 the combined normal and surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-1108,
21 and amendments thereto, equal 2.90% {2.62%}, no further reductions
22 shall occur.
