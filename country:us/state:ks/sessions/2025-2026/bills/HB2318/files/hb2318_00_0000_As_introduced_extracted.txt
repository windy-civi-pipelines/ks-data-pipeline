By Committee on Taxation
Requested by Eric Stafford on behalf of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce
2-6
1 AN ACT concerning taxation; relating to income tax; providing that future

3 amending K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,110 and repealing the existing
4 section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 New Section 1. (a) As used in this section:
8 (1) "Adjusted consumer price ratio" means the fiscal year consumer
9 price index divided by the base year consumer price index.
10 (2) "Adjusted general revenue fund collections" means actual tax
11 receipt revenues to the state general fund.
12 (3) "Base year revenues" means actual tax receipt revenues to the
13 state general fund for fiscal year 2024 in the amount of $10,003,833,599.
14 (4) "Base year consumer price index" means a 12-month average of
15 the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers
16 for fiscal year 2024.
17 (5) "Excess fiscal year general revenue fund collections" means the
18 positive difference from subtracting the inflation adjusted base year
19 revenues from the adjusted general revenue fund collections from the
20 immediately preceding fiscal year.
21 (6) "Fiscal year consumer price index" means a 12-month average of
22 the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers
23 for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
24 (7) "Inflation adjusted base year revenues" means the base year
25 revenues multiplied by the adjusted consumer price ratio.
26 (b) Commencing on August 15, 2025, and every August 15 thereafter,
27 the director of the budget, in consultation with the director of legislative
28 research, shall determine whether the total fiscal year adjusted general
29 revenue fund collections from the immediately preceding fiscal year are in
30 excess of the inflation adjusted base year revenues. If the total fiscal year
31 adjusted general revenue fund collections from the immediately preceding
32 fiscal year are in excess of the inflation adjusted base year revenues, the
33 director of the budget shall certify to the secretary of revenue the existence
34 of such excess and the amount of the excess.
35 (c) In the event that the secretary of revenue certifies that the adjusted
HB 2318 2
1 general revenue fund collections from the immediately preceding fiscal
2 year are in excess of the inflation adjusted base year revenues, the
3 secretary shall calculate and publish the income tax rate reduction as a
4 result of the excess. In calculating the income tax rate reduction, the
5 excess fiscal year general revenue fund collections shall be computed that
6 would result in the reduction of the income tax rates pursuant to subsection
7 (d) in an amount approximately equal to the rate reductions down to the
8 nearest 0.01% to go into effect for the next tax year. Such rate reductions
9 shall remain in effect unless further reduced pursuant to this section. The
10 income tax brackets and taxable income thresholds prescribed in K.S.A.
11 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto, shall be adjusted to reflect the
12 changes in income tax rates.
13 (d) The secretary shall first compute the reduction of the income tax
14 rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto, that
15 decreases proportionally all tax rates in effect. Once the lower income tax
16 rate is decreased to 4.5%, there shall be no further reductions to the lower
17 income tax rate and further reductions shall only be applied to reduce the
18 higher income tax rate in effect. Upon the higher income tax rate being
19 decreased to 4.5%, no further reductions shall occur to K.S.A. 79-
20 32,110(a), and amendments thereto. The secretary shall then compute
21 decreases to the surtax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(c), and
22 amendments thereto. The surtax shall be decreased until the combined
23 normal and surtax rates equal 4.5% that are imposed pursuant to K.S.A.
24 79-32,110(c), and amendments thereto. Once the combined normal and
25 surtax rates pursuant to K.S.A. 79-32,110(a), and amendments thereto,
26 equal 4.5%, no further reductions shall occur.
