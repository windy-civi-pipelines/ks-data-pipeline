19 (3)(c) The appearance bond shall be executed with sufficient solvent
20 sureties who are residents of the state of Kansas, unless the magistrate

39 (11)(k) A magistrate ordering the release of a person on any
40 conditions specified in this section may at any time amend the order to

43 provisions of subsection (10) (j) shall apply.

42 additional or different conditions results in the detention of the person, the
43 provisions of subsection (10) (j) shall apply.

SB 188 11
1 (12)(l) Statements or information offered in determining the
2 conditions of release need not conform to the rules of evidence. No
3 statement or admission of the defendant made at such a proceeding shall
4 be received as evidence in any subsequent proceeding against the
5 defendant.
6 (13)(m) The appearance bond and any security required as a condition
7 of the defendant's release shall be deposited in the office of the magistrate
8 or the clerk of the court where the release is ordered. If the defendant is
9 bound to appear before a magistrate or court other than the one ordering
10 the release, the order of release, together with the bond and security shall
11 be transmitted to the magistrate or clerk of the court before whom the
12 defendant is bound to appear.

21 during such proceeding if the defendant so requests. Exercising the right to
22 be present shall in no way prejudice the defendant.
23 (15)(o) The magistrate may order the person to pay for any costs
24 associated with the supervision of the conditions of release of the
25 appearance bond in an amount not to exceed $15 per week of such
26 supervision. As a condition of sentencing under K.S.A. 21-6604, and
