28 (b), whether provided by a consumer reporting agency, contained in a
29 consumer report or obtained by other means from any public or private
30 source; or
31 (2) consider any consumer report containing any residential or tenant
32 history that does not include an explanation by the consumer or a record of
33 attempts to contact such consumer as required by subsection (a).

37 the landlord shall provide the consumer or tenant with any consumer
38 report or any residential or tenant history from any public or private source
39 obtained, consulted or considered by the landlord with respect to such
40 adverse action.
