Section 1:
As Amended by House Committee
Session of 2025
By Committee on Health and Human Services
Requested by Representative Buehler on behalf of the Kansas Chamber of
Commerce
2-3
1 AN ACT concerning the healing arts; relating to physician assistants;
2 enacting the physician assistant licensure compact to provide interstate
3 practice privileges.
4
5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the physician
7 assistant licensure compact.
8 SECTION 1—PURPOSE
9
10 In order to strengthen access to medical services and in recognition of
11 the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of
12 the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a
13 comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state
14 licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the
15 portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of
16 patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via
17 the mutual recognition of the licensee's qualifying license by other
18 compact-participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
19 standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of
20 medical services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time
21 of the patient encounter and, therefore, requires the PA to be under the
22 jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State
23 licensing boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to
24 impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a
25 PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will
26 alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military
27 personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having
28 an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

5 necessary under applicable law to protect the health and safety of its
6 citizens; and

19 is lawful in such other state for the purpose of taking adverse action
20 against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a compact
21 privilege in the participating state.
22 (d) Nothing in this compact shall be deemed to authorize a

26 (e) For purposes of taking adverse action, the participating state that
27 issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect to
28 reported conduct received from any other participating state as it would if
29 the conduct had occurred within the participating state that issued the
30 qualifying license. The participating state shall apply its own state laws to
31 determine appropriate action.
32 (f) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may
33 recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition of
34 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.

37 procedures for taking the adverse action.
38 (h) Joint investigations.

40 state's PA laws and regulations or other applicable state law, any

4 PA's compact privilege in all remote states shall be deactivated until two
5 years have elapsed after all restrictions have been removed from the state
6 license. All disciplinary orders by the participating state that issued the
7 qualifying license that impose adverse action against a PA's license shall
8 include a statement that the PA's compact privilege is deactivated in all
9 participating states during the pendency of the order.

36 employment, duties or responsibilities or as determined by the commission
37 that the individual against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis
38 for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties
39 or responsibilities. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit such
40 individual from retaining such individual's own counsel at the individual's
41 own expense or that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not
42 result from the individual's intentional, willful or wanton misconduct.
43 (3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member,
HB 2219—Am. by HC 13
1 officer, executive director, employee or representative of the commission
2 for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that
3 individual arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that
4 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
5 responsibilities or that such individual had a reasonable basis for believing
6 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
7 responsibilities, if the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result
8 from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that individual.
9 (4) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
10 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
11 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
12 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in
13 any proceedings as authorized by commission rules.
14 (5) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of
15 any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be
16 governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
17 (6) Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or
18 jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional
19 misconduct, negligence or other such civil action pertaining to the practice
20 of a PA. All such matters shall be determined exclusively by state law
21 other than this compact.
22 (7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
23 abrogate a participating state's state action immunity or state action
24 affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman act,
25 Clayton act or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or
26 regulation.
27 (8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
28 sovereign immunity by the participating states or by the commission.
29
30 SECTION 8—DATA SYSTEM
31
32
33 (a) The commission shall provide for the development, maintenance,
34 operation and utilization of a coordinated data and reporting system
35 containing licensure, adverse action and the reporting of the existence of
36 significant investigative information on all licensed PAs and applicants
37 that are denied a license in participating states.
38 (b) Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a
39 participating state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on all
40 PAs to whom this compact is applicable, utilizing a unique identifier, as
41 required by the rules of the commission, including:
42 (1) Identifying information;
43 (2) licensure data;
HB 2219—Am. by HC 14
1 (3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege;
2 (4) any denial of application for licensure and the reason for such
3 denial, excluding the reporting of any criminal history record information
4 where such reporting is prohibited by law;
5 (5) the existence of significant investigative information; and
6 (6) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
7 compact, as determined by the rules of the commission.
8 (c) Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
9 any participating state shall only be available to other participating states.
10 (d) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states of
11 any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying for a
12 license that has been reported to such commission. Such adverse action
13 information shall be available to any other participating state.
14 (e) Participating states contributing information to the data system
15 may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that
16 shall not be shared with the public without the express permission of the
17 contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such information
18 shall be reported to the commission through the data system.
19 (f) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently
20 expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the participating state
21 contributing the information shall be removed from the data system upon
22 reporting of such by the participating state to the commission.
23 (g) The records and information provided to a participating state
24 pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when certified by the
25 commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business
26 records of the commission and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay
27 exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative
28 proceedings in a participating state.
29
30 SECTION 9—RULEMAKING
31
32
33 (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
34 the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.
35 Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
36 commission for each rule.
37 (b) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
38 effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and
39 achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and have no force
40 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is
41 invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
42 manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, the
43 powers granted hereunder or based upon another applicable standard of
HB 2219—Am. by HC 15
1 review.
2 (c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
3 participating state, except that where the rules of the commission conflict
4 with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical services, a
5 PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent
6 jurisdiction, and the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that
7 state to the extent of the conflict.
8 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a
9 commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
10 manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date of
11 adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
12 any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the
13 compact.
14 (e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting
15 of the commission.
16 (f) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule by the
17 commission and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the
18 rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice
19 of proposed rulemaking:
20 (1) On the commission's website or other publicly accessible
21 platform;
22 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices
23 of proposed rulemaking; and
24 (3) in such other ways as the commission may specify by rule.
25 (g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
26 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing on the proposed
27 rule and the proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the
28 proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
29 (2) the text of and the reason for the proposed rule;
30 (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
31 person and the date by which written comments must be received; and
32 (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the
33 commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or provide any
34 written comments.
35 (h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow
36 persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall
37 be made available to the public.
38 (i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission
39 shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.
40 (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed in
41 the notice of proposed rulemaking published not less than five business
42 days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the commission of
43 their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
HB 2219—Am. by HC 16
1 (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner that provides each
2 person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to
3 comment orally or in writing.
4 (3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the
5 written comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments received in
6 response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person
7 upon request.
8 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
9 hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the
10 convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
11 (j) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all
12 written and oral comments timely received.
13 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final
14 action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the
15 rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the
16 rule.
17 (1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission's website.
18 (2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
19 changes do not expand the original purpose of the proposed rule.
20 (3) The commission shall provide an explanation on its website of the
21 reasons for any substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
22 reasons for any substantive changes not made that were recommended by
23 commenters.
24 (4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
25 the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the
26 effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after the
27 commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
28 (l) Upon the determination that an emergency exists, the commission
29 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours' prior notice,
30 without the opportunity for comment or hearing, expect that the usual
31 rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall
32 be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but in no
33 event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the
34 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that shall be adopted
35 immediately by the commission in order to:
36 (1) Address an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
37 (2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
38 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is
39 established by federal law or rule; or
40 (4) protect public health and safety.
41 (m) The commission, or an authorized committee of the commission,
42 may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission rule for purposes
43 of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency
HB 2219—Am. by HC 17
1 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
2 commission's website. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
3 person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
4 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to
5 a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and
6 delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
7 challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If
8 the revision is challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the
9 approval of the commission.
10 (n) No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under
11 this compact.
12
13
14 SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
15 ENFORCEMENT
16
17
18 (a) Oversight.
19 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
20 participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary
21 and appropriate to implement the compact.
22 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
23 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
24 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
25 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
26 the extent that it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
27 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
28 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
29 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
30 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
31 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
32 or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a
33 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with
34 service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding
35 void as to the commission, this compact or commission rules.
36 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
37 (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has
38 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
39 this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide
40 written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
41 notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default
42 and any other action that the commission may take and shall offer remedial
43 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
HB 2219—Am. by HC 18
1 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
2 may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a
3 majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
4 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be
5 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default shall
6 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
7 the period of default.
8 (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed only
9 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
10 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
11 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
12 legislature and to the licensing board of each of the participating states.
13 (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
14 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
15 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
16 termination.
17 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
18 found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact,
19 unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting
20 state.
21 (6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact
22 by the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the
23 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
24 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such
25 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
26 (7) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the
27 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of
28 such termination:
29 (A) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that
30 state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the effective
31 date of such termination; and
32 (B) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a
33 compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege
34 for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a
35 participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state
36 before the 180-day period ends, in which case, the compact privilege shall
37 continue.
38 (c) Dispute resolution.
39 (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall
40 attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among
41 participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
42 (2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation
43 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
HB 2219—Am. by HC 19
1 (d) Enforcement.
2 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
3 enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the commission.
4 (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance
5 have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may initiate legal
6 action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
7 federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a
8 participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
9 this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws. The
10 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
11 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
12 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
13 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
14 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
15 under federal or state law.
16 (e) Legal action against the commission.
17 (1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the
18 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
19 or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to
20 enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The
21 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
22 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
23 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
24 (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this
25 compact against the commission.
26
27 SECTION 11—DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA
28 LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
29
30
31 (a) This compact shall come into effect on the date that this compact
32 statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
33 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission
34 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted
35 the compact prior to the commission convening, called charter-
36 participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such
37 charter-participating state is materially different than the model compact.
38 (A) A charter-participating state whose enactment is found to be
39 materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default
40 process set forth in section 10(b).
41 (B) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its
42 participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence and
43 the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating
HB 2219—Am. by HC 20
1 states should be fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the
2 compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be subject to the
3 process set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are
4 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for
5 participation in the compact.
6 (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
7 initial charter-participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in
8 section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
9 from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the
10 compact.
11 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
12 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
13 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence
14 shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
15 repudiated by the commission.
16 (b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the
17 commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that this compact
18 becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by
19 the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day that
20 this compact becomes law in that state.
21 (c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by
22 enacting a statute repealing the same.
23 (1) A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
24 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During the 180-day period,
25 all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were
26 granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in
27 effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in
28 another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
29 within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating
30 states shall not be affected by the passage of the 180 days.
31 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state
32 licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative
33 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
34 effective date of withdrawal.
35 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this
36 compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to
37 all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to
38 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of
39 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
40 (d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
41 or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
42 between participating states and between a participating state and
43 nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this
HB 2219—Am. by HC 21
1 compact.
2 (e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No
3 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
4 participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the
5 laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
6
7 SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
8
9 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be
10 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation
11 and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
12 authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall not be construed to
13 limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
14 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any
15 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
16 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
17 participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
18 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
19 person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
20 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and
21 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
22 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
23 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or subsection
24 (b), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or, in
25 accordance with the requirements of section 10(b), terminate a
26 participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
27 constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with
28 respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure
29 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary
30 to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in
31 full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full
32 force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable
33 matters.
34
35 SECTION 13—BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
36
37
38 (a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
39 participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
40 (b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are
41 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
42 (c) All agreements between the commission and the participating
43 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
HB 2219—Am. by HC 22
1 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
2 publication in the statute book.

Raw Text:
As Amended by House Committee
Session of 2025
HOUSE BILL No. 2219
By Committee on Health and Human Services
Requested by Representative Buehler on behalf of the Kansas Chamber of
Commerce
2-3
1 AN ACT concerning the healing arts; relating to physician assistants;
2 enacting the physician assistant licensure compact to provide interstate
3 practice privileges.
4
5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the physician
7 assistant licensure compact.
8 SECTION 1—PURPOSE
9
10 In order to strengthen access to medical services and in recognition of
11 the advances in the delivery of medical services, the participating states of
12 the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a
13 comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state
14 licensing boards to license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the
15 portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of
16 patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via
17 the mutual recognition of the licensee's qualifying license by other
18 compact-participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
19 standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of
20 medical services by the PA occurs where the patient is located at the time
21 of the patient encounter and, therefore, requires the PA to be under the
22 jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State
23 licensing boards that participate in this compact retain the jurisdiction to
24 impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to a
25 PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will
26 alleviate burdens for military families by allowing active duty military
27 personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on having
28 an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.
29

4 probation, monitoring of the licensee or restriction on the licensee's
5 practice.
6 (b) "Compact privilege" means the authorization granted by a remote

29

25 commission and subject to the following requirements:
26 (a) When applying for a compact privilege, the licensee shall provide

35 the commission or a participating state.
36
37 SECTION 6—ADVERSE ACTIONS
38
39
40 (a) A participating state in which a licensee is licensed shall have
41 exclusive power to impose adverse action against the qualifying license
42 issued by that participating state.
43 (b) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote

HB 2219—Am. by HC 6
1 state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process
2 law, to:
3 (1) Take adverse action against a PA's compact privilege within that
4 state to remove a licensee's compact privilege or take other action
5 necessary under applicable law to protect the health and safety of its
6 citizens; and
7 (2) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
8 the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of
9 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a participating state for
10 the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence
11 from another participating state shall be enforced in the latter state by any
12 court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of
13 such court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before
14 it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses,
15 mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which
16 the witnesses or evidence is located.
17 (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), subpoenas shall not be issued
18 by a participating state to gather evidence of conduct in another state that
19 is lawful in such other state for the purpose of taking adverse action
20 against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a compact
21 privilege in the participating state.
22 (d) Nothing in this compact shall be deemed to authorize a
23 participating state to impose discipline against a PA's compact privilege or
24 to deny an application for a compact privilege in that participating state for
25 the individual's otherwise lawful practice in another state.
26 (e) For purposes of taking adverse action, the participating state that
27 issued the qualifying license shall give the same priority and effect to
28 reported conduct received from any other participating state as it would if
29 the conduct had occurred within the participating state that issued the
30 qualifying license. The participating state shall apply its own state laws to
31 determine appropriate action.
32 (f) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may
33 recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and disposition of
34 cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.
35 (g) A participating state may take adverse action based on the factual
36 findings of a remote state if the participating state follows its own
37 procedures for taking the adverse action.
38 (h) Joint investigations.
39 (1) In addition to the authority granted to a participating state by such
40 state's PA laws and regulations or other applicable state law, any
41 participating state may participate with other participating states in joint
42 investigations of licensees.
43 (2) Participating states shall share any investigative, litigation or

HB 2219—Am. by HC 7
1 compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation
2 initiated under this compact.
3 (i) If an adverse action is taken against a PA's qualifying license, the
4 PA's compact privilege in all remote states shall be deactivated until two
5 years have elapsed after all restrictions have been removed from the state
6 license. All disciplinary orders by the participating state that issued the
7 qualifying license that impose adverse action against a PA's license shall
8 include a statement that the PA's compact privilege is deactivated in all
9 participating states during the pendency of the order.
10 (j) If any participating state takes adverse action, it promptly shall
11 notify the administrator of the data system.

1 (F) establish additional committees as necessary;
2 (G) exercise the powers and duties of the commission during the
3 interim between commission meetings, except for issuing proposed
4 rulemaking or adopting commission rules or bylaws or exercising any
5 other powers and duties exclusively reserved to the commission by the
6 commission's rules; and
7 (H) perform other duties as provided in the commission's rules or
8 bylaws.
9 (6) All meetings of the executive committee at which it votes or plans
10 to vote on matters in exercising the powers and duties of the commission
11 shall be open to the public and public notice of such meetings shall be
12 given as public meetings of the commission are given.
13 (7) The executive committee may convene in a closed, nonpublic
14 meeting for the same reasons that the commission may convene in a
15 nonpublic meeting as set forth in subsection (d)(3), and shall announce the
16 closed meeting as the commission is required to do under subsection (d)(4)
17 and keep minutes of the closed meeting as the commission is required to
18 do under subsection (d)(5).
19 (g) Qualified immunity, defense and indemnification.
20 (1) The members, officers, executive director, employees and
21 representatives of the commission shall be immune from suit and liability,
22 both personally and in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to
23 or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or
24 arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred or
25 that the individual against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis
26 for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties
27 or responsibilities. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect
28 any such individual from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or
29 liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of such
30 individual. The procurement of insurance of any type by the commission
31 shall not in any way compromise or limit the immunity granted hereunder.
32 (2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive
33 director, employee, and representative of the commission in any civil
34 action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act,
35 error or omission that occurred within the scope of commission
36 employment, duties or responsibilities or as determined by the commission
37 that the individual against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis
38 for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties
39 or responsibilities. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit such
40 individual from retaining such individual's own counsel at the individual's
41 own expense or that the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not
42 result from the individual's intentional, willful or wanton misconduct.
43 (3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member,

HB 2219—Am. by HC 13
1 officer, executive director, employee or representative of the commission
2 for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that
3 individual arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that
4 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
5 responsibilities or that such individual had a reasonable basis for believing
6 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or
7 responsibilities, if the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result
8 from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that individual.
9 (4) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
10 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
11 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
12 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in
13 any proceedings as authorized by commission rules.
14 (5) Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the liability of
15 any licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which shall be
16 governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
17 (6) Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or
18 jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional
19 misconduct, negligence or other such civil action pertaining to the practice
20 of a PA. All such matters shall be determined exclusively by state law
21 other than this compact.
22 (7) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise
23 abrogate a participating state's state action immunity or state action
24 affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman act,
25 Clayton act or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or
26 regulation.
27 (8) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to be a waiver of
28 sovereign immunity by the participating states or by the commission.
29
30 SECTION 8—DATA SYSTEM
31
32
33 (a) The commission shall provide for the development, maintenance,
34 operation and utilization of a coordinated data and reporting system
35 containing licensure, adverse action and the reporting of the existence of
36 significant investigative information on all licensed PAs and applicants
37 that are denied a license in participating states.
38 (b) Notwithstanding any other state law to the contrary, a
39 participating state shall submit a uniform data set to the data system on all
40 PAs to whom this compact is applicable, utilizing a unique identifier, as
41 required by the rules of the commission, including:
42 (1) Identifying information;
43 (2) licensure data;

HB 2219—Am. by HC 14
1 (3) adverse actions against a license or compact privilege;
2 (4) any denial of application for licensure and the reason for such
3 denial, excluding the reporting of any criminal history record information
4 where such reporting is prohibited by law;
5 (5) the existence of significant investigative information; and
6 (6) other information that may facilitate the administration of this
7 compact, as determined by the rules of the commission.
8 (c) Significant investigative information pertaining to a licensee in
9 any participating state shall only be available to other participating states.
10 (d) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states of
11 any adverse action taken against a licensee or an individual applying for a
12 license that has been reported to such commission. Such adverse action
13 information shall be available to any other participating state.
14 (e) Participating states contributing information to the data system
15 may, in accordance with state or federal law, designate information that
16 shall not be shared with the public without the express permission of the
17 contributing state. Notwithstanding any such designation, such information
18 shall be reported to the commission through the data system.
19 (f) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently
20 expunged pursuant to federal law or the laws of the participating state
21 contributing the information shall be removed from the data system upon
22 reporting of such by the participating state to the commission.
23 (g) The records and information provided to a participating state
24 pursuant to this compact or through the data system, when certified by the
25 commission or an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business
26 records of the commission and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay
27 exception in any relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative
28 proceedings in a participating state.
29
30 SECTION 9—RULEMAKING
31
32
33 (a) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to
34 the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.
35 Commission rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
36 commission for each rule.
37 (b) The commission shall adopt reasonable rules in order to
38 effectively and efficiently implement and administer this compact and
39 achieve its purposes. A commission rule shall be invalid and have no force
40 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is
41 invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a
42 manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, the
43 powers granted hereunder or based upon another applicable standard of

HB 2219—Am. by HC 15
1 review.
2 (c) The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each
3 participating state, except that where the rules of the commission conflict
4 with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical services, a
5 PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent
6 jurisdiction, and the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that
7 state to the extent of the conflict.
8 (d) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a
9 commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same
10 manner used to adopt this compact within four years of the date of
11 adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
12 any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the
13 compact.
14 (e) Commission rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting
15 of the commission.
16 (f) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule by the
17 commission and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the
18 rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice
19 of proposed rulemaking:
20 (1) On the commission's website or other publicly accessible
21 platform;
22 (2) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices
23 of proposed rulemaking; and
24 (3) in such other ways as the commission may specify by rule.
25 (g) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
26 (1) The time, date and location of the public hearing on the proposed
27 rule and the proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which the
28 proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
29 (2) the text of and the reason for the proposed rule;
30 (3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested
31 person and the date by which written comments must be received; and
32 (4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the
33 commission of their intention to attend the public hearing or provide any
34 written comments.
35 (h) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow
36 persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which shall
37 be made available to the public.
38 (i) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission
39 shall publish the mechanism for access to the electronic hearing.
40 (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed in
41 the notice of proposed rulemaking published not less than five business
42 days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the commission of
43 their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.

HB 2219—Am. by HC 16
1 (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner that provides each
2 person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to
3 comment orally or in writing.
4 (3) All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and the
5 written comments, data, facts, opinions and arguments received in
6 response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person
7 upon request.
8 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
9 hearing on each proposed rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the
10 convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
11 (j) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all
12 written and oral comments timely received.
13 (k) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final
14 action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the
15 rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the
16 rule.
17 (1) If adopted, the rule shall be posted on the commission's website.
18 (2) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule if the
19 changes do not expand the original purpose of the proposed rule.
20 (3) The commission shall provide an explanation on its website of the
21 reasons for any substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as
22 reasons for any substantive changes not made that were recommended by
23 commenters.
24 (4) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for
25 the rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection (l), the
26 effective date of the rule shall be not sooner than 30 days after the
27 commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
28 (l) Upon the determination that an emergency exists, the commission
29 may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours' prior notice,
30 without the opportunity for comment or hearing, expect that the usual
31 rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section shall
32 be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible but in no
33 event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the
34 purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that shall be adopted
35 immediately by the commission in order to:
36 (1) Address an imminent threat to public health, safety or welfare;
37 (2) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
38 (3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is
39 established by federal law or rule; or
40 (4) protect public health and safety.
41 (m) The commission, or an authorized committee of the commission,
42 may direct revisions to a previously adopted commission rule for purposes
43 of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency

HB 2219—Am. by HC 17
1 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
2 commission's website. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
3 person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
4 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to
5 a rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and
6 delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
7 challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If
8 the revision is challenged, the revision shall not take effect without the
9 approval of the commission.
10 (n) No participating state's rulemaking requirements shall apply under
11 this compact.
12
13
14 SECTION 10—OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND
15 ENFORCEMENT
16
17
18 (a) Oversight.
19 (1) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each
20 participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary
21 and appropriate to implement the compact.
22 (2) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
23 commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
24 competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
25 located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
26 the extent that it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute
27 resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or
28 propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
29 malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
30 (3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in
31 any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact
32 or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in such a
33 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with
34 service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding
35 void as to the commission, this compact or commission rules.
36 (b) Default, technical assistance and termination.
37 (1) If the commission determines that a participating state has
38 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
39 this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide
40 written notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The
41 notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default
42 and any other action that the commission may take and shall offer remedial
43 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.

HB 2219—Am. by HC 18
1 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
2 may be terminated from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a
3 majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
4 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be
5 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default shall
6 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
7 the period of default.
8 (3) Termination of participation in this compact shall be imposed only
9 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
10 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the
11 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's
12 legislature and to the licensing board of each of the participating states.
13 (4) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
14 obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of
15 termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
16 termination.
17 (5) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is
18 found to be in default or that has been terminated from this compact,
19 unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting
20 state.
21 (6) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact
22 by the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the
23 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
24 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such
25 litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
26 (7) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the
27 state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of
28 such termination:
29 (A) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that
30 state shall retain the compact privilege for 180 days following the effective
31 date of such termination; and
32 (B) licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a
33 compact privilege in a participating state shall retain the compact privilege
34 for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying license in a
35 participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state
36 before the 180-day period ends, in which case, the compact privilege shall
37 continue.
38 (c) Dispute resolution.
39 (1) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall
40 attempt to resolve disputes related to this compact that arise among
41 participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
42 (2) The commission shall adopt a rule providing for both mediation
43 and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

HB 2219—Am. by HC 19
1 (d) Enforcement.
2 (1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
3 enforce the provisions of this compact and rules of the commission.
4 (2) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance
5 have been exhausted, by majority vote, the commission may initiate legal
6 action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the
7 federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a
8 participating state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of
9 this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws. The
10 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
11 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
12 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
13 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
14 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available
15 under federal or state law.
16 (e) Legal action against the commission.
17 (1) A participating state may initiate legal action against the
18 commission in the United States district court for the District of Columbia
19 or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to
20 enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The
21 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
22 that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
23 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
24 (2) No person other than a participating state shall enforce this
25 compact against the commission.
26
27 SECTION 11—DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA
28 LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
29
30
31 (a) This compact shall come into effect on the date that this compact
32 statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state.
33 (1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission
34 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted
35 the compact prior to the commission convening, called charter-
36 participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such
37 charter-participating state is materially different than the model compact.
38 (A) A charter-participating state whose enactment is found to be
39 materially different from the model compact shall be entitled to the default
40 process set forth in section 10(b).
41 (B) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its
42 participation is terminated, the commission shall remain in existence and
43 the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating

HB 2219—Am. by HC 20
1 states should be fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the
2 compact subsequent to the commission convening shall be subject to the
3 process set forth in section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are
4 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for
5 participation in the compact.
6 (2) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven
7 initial charter-participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in
8 section 7(c)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
9 from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the
10 compact.
11 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in
12 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to
13 the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence
14 shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically
15 repudiated by the commission.
16 (b) Any state that joins this compact shall be subject to the
17 commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on the date that this compact
18 becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by
19 the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day that
20 this compact becomes law in that state.
21 (c) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by
22 enacting a statute repealing the same.
23 (1) A participating state's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
24 days after enactment of the repealing statute. During the 180-day period,
25 all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state and were
26 granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state shall remain in
27 effect. If any licensee licensed in the withdrawing state is also licensed in
28 another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
29 within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating
30 states shall not be affected by the passage of the 180 days.
31 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the state
32 licensing board of the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative
33 and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
34 effective date of withdrawal.
35 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this
36 compact, the state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to
37 all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall continue to
38 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of
39 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
40 (d) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
41 or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
42 between participating states and between a participating state and
43 nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this

HB 2219—Am. by HC 21
1 compact.
2 (e) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No
3 amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any
4 participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into the
5 laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
6
7 SECTION 12—CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
8
9 (a) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be
10 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation
11 and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly
12 authorizing or requiring the adoption of rules shall not be construed to
13 limit the commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
14 (b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any
15 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is held by a court of
16 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
17 participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact or of the
18 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
19 person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
20 competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and
21 the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or
22 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
23 (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection or subsection
24 (b), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact or, in
25 accordance with the requirements of section 10(b), terminate a
26 participating state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
27 constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would be with
28 respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure
29 from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary
30 to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in
31 full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full
32 force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable
33 matters.
34
35 SECTION 13—BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
36
37
38 (a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
39 participating state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
40 (b) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are
41 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
42 (c) All agreements between the commission and the participating
43 states are binding in accordance with their terms.

HB 2219—Am. by HC 22
1 Sec. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
2 publication in the statute book.
