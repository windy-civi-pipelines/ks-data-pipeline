9 guardianship or conservatorship transferred from another state does not
10 affect the ability of the guardian or conservator to seek appointment as

12 amendments thereto, if the court has jurisdiction to make an appointment
13 other than by reason of the provisional order of transfer.

41 welfare of the minor may petition the court to terminate the guardianship,

17 guardian to facilitate transition of the guardian's responsibilities and
18 protect the best interest of the minor.

21 determines.
22 New Sec. 64. (a) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court
23 may:
24 (1) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and
25 convincing evidence that:
26 (A) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements
27 for physical health, safety or self-care because the respondent is unable to
28 receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even
29 with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported
30 decision making; and
31 (B) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective
32 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative; or
33 (2) with appropriate findings, treat the petition as one for a
34 conservatorship under sections 83 through 118, and amendments thereto,
35 or a protective arrangement under sections 119 through 130, and
36 amendments thereto, issue any appropriate order or dismiss the
37 proceeding.
38 (b) The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (a)
39 only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and limitations
40 of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the
41 respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court
42 may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, protective
43 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternatives
HB 2359—Am. by HC 37
1 would meet the needs of the respondent.

HB 2359—Am. by HC 42
1 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and

21 of failing to do so; or
22 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
23 participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services and
24 technological assistance.
25 (c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 66, and
26 amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing,
27 assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of

32 respondent at a hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto.

31 subsection for good cause may request permission from the court for
32 access to court records of the guardianship, including the guardian's report
33 and plan. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest of the

7 court in appointing a guardian for an adult shall consider persons qualified
8 to be guardian in the following order of priority:
9 (1) A guardian, other than a temporary or emergency guardian,

20 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection (a),
21 the court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best
22 qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider
23 the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's skills, the
24 expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the person and the
25 respondent have similar values and preferences and the likelihood the
26 person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian successfully.
27 (c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
28 decline to appoint as guardian a person having priority under subsection
29 (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.
30 (d) In determining whether the appointment of a proposed guardian is
31 in the best interest of the respondent, the court shall consider the number
32 of other cases in which the proposed guardian, other than a corporation, is
33 currently serving as guardian, particularly if that number is more than 15.
34 (e) The following persons shall not be appointed as guardian unless
35 the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is the best
36 qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the
37 best interest of the respondent:

39 individual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the

4 New Sec. 73. (a) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult
5 must:
6 (1) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
7 established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a
8 protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive
9 alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services, technological
10 assistance or supported decision making; and
11 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
12 established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the
13 petition.
14 (b) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must
15 state the basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific findings
16 that support the conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the

43 (f) A spouse and adult children of an adult subject to guardianship are

4 New Sec. 74. (a) Not later than 14 days after the appointment, a

11 entitled to notice under section 72(e), and amendments thereto, or a
12 subsequent order a statement of the rights of the adult subject to
13 guardianship and procedures to seek relief if the adult is denied those
14 rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, in plain language
15 and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject to
16 guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to
17 guardianship of the right to:
18 (1) Seek termination or modification of the guardianship, or removal
19 of the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these
20 matters;
21 (2) file a grievance against the guardian under section 50, and

29 of healthcare options to the extent reasonably feasible;
30 (5) be notified at least 14 days before a change in the adult's primary
31 dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility or
32 other facility that places restrictions on the individual's ability to leave or
33 have visitors unless the change or move is proposed in the guardian's plan

35 specific order;
36 (6) object to a change or move described in paragraph (5) and the
37 process for objecting;
38 (7) communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving

41 (A) The guardian has been authorized by the court by specific order
42 to restrict communications, visits or interactions;
43 (B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of
HB 2359—Am. by HC 48
1 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
2 or
3 (C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
4 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
5 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction
6 is:
7 (i) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
8 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
9 (ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
10 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult;

17 New Sec. 75. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
18 section 65, and amendments thereto, or on verified petition by a person
19 interested in an adult's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
20 guardian for the adult if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
21 establish probable cause that:
22 (1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
23 imminent and substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety or
24 welfare;
25 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
26 circumstances; and
27 (3) a basis for appointment of a guardian under section 64, and
28 amendments thereto, exists.
29 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult
30 may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only
31 the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency
32 guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for not more than
33 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions
34 for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (a) continue.
35 (c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an
36 emergency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to
37 represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided
38 in subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a
39 hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the respondent's
40 attorney and any other person the court determines.
41 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult
42 without notice to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the court
43 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physical health,
HB 2359—Am. by HC 49
1 safety or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice
2 on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency
3 guardian without giving notice under subsection (c), the court must:
4 (1) Give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
5 appointment to:
6 (A) The respondent;
7 (B) the respondent's attorney; and
8 (C) any other person the court determines; and
9 (2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later
10 than five days after the appointment.
11 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a
12 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under
13 section 64, and amendments thereto.
14 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
15 this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the
16 court requires.
17 New Sec. 76. (a) A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary. A guardian
18 shall strive to assure that the personal, civil and human rights of the
19 individual subject to guardianship are protected. Except as otherwise
20 limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions regarding
21 the support, care, education, health and welfare of the adult subject to
22 guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's limitations and in
23 accordance with the guardian's plan under section 79, and amendments
24 thereto.
25 (b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the
26 adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, include the adult in decision
27 making, and encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act on the
28 adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the
29 adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
30 (1) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and
31 maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular
32 visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities
33 and physical and mental health;
34 (2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and
35 preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the
36 adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities or
37 social interactions; and
38 (3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive
39 relationships and services for the adult.
40 (c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care,
41 diligence and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for
42 the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
43 (1) Take reasonable care of the personal effects and service or support
HB 2359—Am. by HC 50
1 animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or
2 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect
3 the adult's property;
4 (2) if authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
5 thereto, expend funds and other property of the adult received by the
6 guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health
7 and welfare;
8 (3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended
9 under paragraph (2) for the adult's future needs, but if a conservator has
10 been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other property at least
11 quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the adult's future needs;
12 and
13 (4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services,
14 provided to the adult.
15 (d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
16 guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the
17 adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would
18 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
19 interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to
20 guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's
21 previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, cultural practices,
22 religious beliefs, values and actions, to the extent actually known or
23 reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
24 (e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under subsection
25 (d) because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine
26 the decision the adult probably would make if able, or the guardian
27 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
28 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
29 interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best
30 interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the adult, the
31 guardian shall consider:
32 (1) Information received from professionals and persons that
33 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;
34 (2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have
35 considered if the adult were able to act; and
36 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult
37 would consider, including consequences for others.
38 (f) A guardian for an adult shall notify the court immediately if the
39 condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising
40 rights previously removed.
41 New Sec. 77. (a) Except as limited by court order, a guardian for an
42 adult may:
43 (1) If authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
HB 2359—Am. by HC 51
1 thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
2 adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application or
3 receipt is within the powers of the conservator;
4 (2) establish the adult's place of dwelling;
5 (3) consent to health, including mental health, or other care, treatment
6 or service for the adult;
7 (4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed, commence a
8 proceeding including an administrative proceeding, or take other
9 appropriate action to compel another person to support the adult or pay
10 funds for the adult's benefit; and
11 (5) receive personally identifiable healthcare information regarding
12 the adult.
13 (b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
14 to consent to the adoption of the adult.
15 (c) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
16 to litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce, dissolution or
17 annulment of marriage of the individual subject to guardianship, including
18 negotiation of a settlement thereof.
19 (d) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (b)
20 or (c), the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in
21 accordance with the adult's preferences, values and prior directions and
22 whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.
23 (e) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(2) to
24 establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:
25 (1) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would
26 select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making
27 standard in section 76(d) and (e), and amendments thereto. If the guardian
28 does not know and cannot reasonably determine what setting the adult
29 subject to guardianship probably would choose if able, or the guardian
30 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
31 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
32 interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance with section
33 76(e), and amendments thereto, a residential setting that is consistent with
34 the adult's best interest;
35 (2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a
36 residential setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with
37 persons important to the adult and meet the adult's needs in the least
38 restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
39 inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 76(d) and (e),
40 and amendments thereto;
41 (3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the adult:
42 (A) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult and any person
43 identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 52
1 guardian or a subsequent order; and
2 (B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new dwelling
3 and state whether the adult received advance notice of the change and
4 whether the adult objected to the change;
5 (4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult to
6 a nursing home, mental health facility or other facility that places
7 restrictions on the adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
8 (A) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under section
9 79, and amendments thereto;
10 (B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or
11 (C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at least 14
12 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons entitled
13 to notice under section 73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent
14 order, and no objection is filed;
15 (5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside this
16 state only if consistent with the guardian's plan and authorized by the court
17 by specific order; and
18 (6) take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the lease
19 to the primary dwelling of the adult only if:
20 (A) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan under
21 section 79, and amendments thereto;
22 (B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or
23 (C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the action to
24 the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under section 73(e)(2), and
25 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order and no objection has been
26 filed.
27 (f) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(3) to make
28 healthcare decisions, the guardian shall:
29 (1) Involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably
30 feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting the
31 adult in understanding the risks and benefits of healthcare options;
32 (2) act in accordance with any declaration of the adult made pursuant
33 to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109, and amendments
34 thereto; and
35 (3) take into account:

37 (B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult, if known
38 or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
39 New Sec. 78. (a) A guardian for an adult may shall not initiate the
40 commitment of the adult to a mental health facility except in accordance
41 with the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons, K.S.A. 59-2945 et
42 seq., and amendments thereto.
43 (b) A guardian for an adult may shall not restrict the ability of the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 53
1 adult to communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
2 visitors and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or
3 electronic communications, including through social media, or
4 participating in social activities, unless:
5 (1) Authorized by the court by specific order;
6 (2) a protective order or a protective arrangement instead of
7 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
8 or
9 (3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
10 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
11 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult and the restriction is:
12 (A) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
13 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
14 (B) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
15 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult.
16 (c) A guardian for an adult may shall not consent, on behalf of the
17 adult, to:
18 (1) Any psychosurgery, removal of any bodily organ or amputation of

21 preserve the life of the adult or to prevent serious and irreparable
22 impairment to the physical health of the adult;
23 (2) the sterilization of the adult, unless approved by the court
24 following a due process hearing held for the purposes of determining

28 procedure on the adult, or for the adult to be a participant in any
29 biomedical or behavioral experiment, without the prior review and
30 approval of such by either an institutional review board as provided for in
31 title 45, part 46 of the code of federal regulations, or if such regulations do
32 not apply, then by a review committee established by the agency,
33 institution or treatment facility at which the procedure or experiment is
34 proposed to occur, composed of members selected for the purposes of
35 determining whether the proposed procedure or experiment:
36 (A) Does not involve any significant risk of harm to the physical or
37 mental health of the adult, or the use of aversive stimulants, and is
38 intended to preserve the life or health of the adult or to assist the adult to
39 develop or regain skills or abilities; or
40 (B) involves a significant risk of harm to the physical or mental
41 health of the adult, or the use of an aversive stimulant, but that the
42 conducting of the proposed procedure or experiment is intended either to
43 preserve the life of the adult, or to significantly improve the quality of life
HB 2359—Am. by HC 54
1 of the adult, or to assist the adult to develop or regain significant skills or
2 abilities, and that the guardian has been fully informed concerning the
3 potential risks and benefits of the proposed procedure or experiment or of
4 any aversive stimulant proposed to be used, and as to how and under what
5 circumstances the aversive stimulant may be used, and has specifically
6 consented to such;
7 (4) the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-sustaining
8 medical care, treatment, services or procedures, except:
9 (A) In accordance with the provisions of any declaration of the adult
10 made pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109,
11 and amendments thereto; or
12 (B) if the adult, prior to the court's appointment of a guardian, has
13 executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions pursuant to
14 K.S.A. 58-625, et seq., and amendments thereto, and that durable power of
15 attorney has not previously been revoked by the adult, and it includes any
16 provision relevant to the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
17 sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures, then the
18 guardian shall have the authority to act as provided for in that power of
19 attorney, even if the guardian has revoked or amended that power of
20 attorney pursuant to the authority of K.S.A. 58-627, and amendments
21 thereto; or
22 (C) in the circumstances where the adult's treating physician certifies
23 in writing to the guardian that the adult is in a persistent vegetative state or
24 is suffering from an illness or other medical condition for which further
25 treatment, other than for the relief of pain, would not likely prolong the life
26 of the adult other than by artificial means, nor would be likely to restore to
27 the adult any significant degree of capabilities beyond those the adult
28 currently possesses, and which opinion is concurred in by either a second
29 physician or by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the
30 healthcare provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing
31 such circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
32 order which would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
33 saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures.
34 The court shall review the written certification within 72 hours at a due
35 process hearing during which the adult is represented by an attorney
36 appointed by the court. The court may request that the state protection and
37 advocacy agency as provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or K.S.A. 74-
38 5515(a)(2)(A) and (B), and amendments thereto, or 42 U.S.C. 15043, 42
39 U.S.C. 10805 or 29 U.S.C. 794e represent the adult. Upon completion of
40 the hearing, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
41 adult meets the conditions set forth in this section, the court shall approve
42 the written certification. If the court does not find by clear and convincing
43 evidence that the adult meets the conditions set forth in this section, then
HB 2359—Am. by HC 55
1 the written certification shall not be approved in accordance with
2 subsection (d) or (e).
3 (d) (1) It shall be presumed that every adult under guardianship
4 has directed such adult's guardian to direct the adult's healthcare
5 providers to provide such adult with nutrition or hydration or both to
6 a degree that is sufficient to sustain life. No court, guardian or any
7 person shall have the authority to make a decision on behalf of an
8 adult who is legally incapable of making healthcare decisions to
9 withhold or withdraw nutrition or hydration or both from such adult
10 except if:
11 (A) The adult, when legally capable of making healthcare
12 decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
13 directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawal of
14 nutrition or hydration or both under the adult's current
15 circumstances. Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a
16 declaration or a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions
17 described in subsection (c)(4); or
18 (B) the adult's treating physician certifies in writing that, in the
19 physician's reasonable medical judgment:
20 (i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
21 would hasten death; or
22 (ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
23 nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not contribute to
24 sustaining the adult's life.
25 (2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawing nutrition or
26 hydration or both under paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with
27 the court with the written certification from the adult's treating
28 physician.
29 (B) Notice of such filing shall be provided to the adult subject to
30 guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
31 guardianship and any other person whom the court determines at the
32 time of filing of the petition.
33 (C) The court shall appoint an attorney for the adult. The court
34 may request that the state protection and advocacy agency as
35 provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments
36 thereto, or 42 U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e,
37 represent the adult.
38 (D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
39 thereafter as the court is available.
40 (E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawing
41 nutrition or hydration or both unless the court finds by clear and
42 convincing evidence that:
43 (i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
HB 2359—Am. by HC 56
1 would hasten death; or
2 (ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
3 nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not
4 contribute to sustaining the adult's life.
5 (3) (A) A cause of action for injunctive relief may be maintained:
6 (i) Against any person who is reasonably believed to be about to
7 violate or who is in the course of violating this subsection; or
8 (ii) to secure a court determination, notwithstanding the position
9 of a guardian, that the adult legally incapable of making healthcare
10 decisions, when legally capable of making such decisions, executed
11 expressly and with informed consent, a written directive to withdraw
12 or withhold hydration or nutrition or both in the applicable
13 circumstances. Such written directive shall be presumed valid unless
14 there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
15 (B) The action may be brought by any person who is:
16 (i) The spouse, parent, child or sibling of the adult;
17 (ii) a current healthcare provider of the adult;
18 (iii) the guardian of the adult;
19 (iv) the state protection and advocacy agency as provided by
20 K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments thereto, or 42
21 U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e; or
22 (v) a public official with appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the
23 laws of this state.
24 (C) Pending the final determination of the court, the court shall
25 direct that nutrition or hydration or both be provided to such adult
26 unless the court determines that paragraph (3)(A) is applicable.
27 (e) (1) No court, guardian or any person shall have the authority
28 to make a decision on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of
29 making healthcare decisions to withhold or withdraw life-saving or
30 life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures from
31 such adult except if:
32 (A) The adult, when legally capable of making healthcare
33 decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
34 directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawing of
35 life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
36 procedures from such adult under the adult's current circumstances.
37 Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a declaration or a
38 durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions described in
39 subsection (c)(4); or
40 (B) (i) The adult's treating physician certifies in writing to the
41 guardian that the adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
42 sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong
43 the dying process; and
HB 2359—Am. by HC 57
1 (ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or
2 by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
3 provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
4 circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
5 order that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
6 saving or life-sustaining medical care.
7 (2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
8 sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures under
9 paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with the court with the
10 written certification from the adult's treating physician.
11 (B) Notice of such filing shall be provided to the adult subject to
12 guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
13 guardianship and any other person whom the court determines at the
14 time of filing of the petition.
15 (C) The court shall appoint an attorney for the adult. The court
16 may request that the state protection and advocacy agency as
17 provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments
18 thereto, or 42 U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e,
19 represent the adult.
20 (D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
21 thereafter as the court is available.
22 (E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawal of
23 life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
24 procedures unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
25 that:
26 (i) The adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
27 sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong
28 the dying process; and
29 (ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or
30 by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
31 provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
32 circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
33 order that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
34 saving or life-sustaining medical care.
35 (f) A guardian for an adult may shall not exercise any control or
36 authority over the adult's estate, unless specifically authorized by the court.
37 Any guardian who is granted such authority must shall prepare an
38 inventory and provide notice of the inventory as provided in section 104,
39 and amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to the
40 guardian and may waive the requirement of the posting of a bond, only if:
41 (1) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by the
42 adult equals $25,000 or less; and
43 (2) either the court requires the guardian to report to the court the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 58
1 commencement of the exercising of such authority, or requires the
2 guardian to obtain court authorization to commence the exercise of such
3 authority, as the court shall specify; and
4 (3) the court also requires the guardian, whenever the combined value
5 of such funds and property exceeds $25,000, to:
6 (A) File a guardian's plan as provided for in section 79, and
7 amendments thereto, that contains elements similar to those that would be
8 contained in a conservator's plan as provided for in section 103, and
9 amendments thereto;
10 (B) petition the court for appointment of a conservator; or
11 (C) notify the court as the court shall specify that the value of the
12 adult's estate has equaled or exceeded $25,000, if the court has earlier
13 appointed a conservator but did not issue letters of conservatorship
14 pending such notification;
15 (e)(g) A guardian for an adult may shall not access digital assets of
16 the adult except if unless authorized by the court pursuant to K.S.A. 2024
17 Supp. 58-4814, and amendments thereto.
18 New Sec. 79. (a) Not later than 60 days after appointment and when
19 there is a significant change in circumstances, or the guardian seeks to
20 deviate significantly from the existing guardian's plan, a guardian for an
21 adult shall file with the court a plan for the care of the adult. The plan must
22 be based on the needs of the adult and take into account the best interest of
23 the adult as well as the adult's preferences, values and prior directions, to
24 the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. The
25 guardian shall include in the plan:
26 (1) The living arrangement, services and supports the guardian
27 expects to arrange, facilitate or continue for the adult;
28 (2) social and educational activities the guardian expects to facilitate
29 on behalf of the adult;

34 communication with the adult;
35 (5) goals for the adult, including any goal related to the restoration of
36 the adult's rights, and how the guardian anticipates achieving the goals;
37 (6) whether the adult has an existing plan and, if so, whether the
38 guardian's plan is consistent with the adult's plan; and
39 (7) a statement or list of the amount the guardian proposes to charge
40 for each service the guardian anticipates providing to the adult.
41 (b) A guardian shall give notice of the filing of the guardian's plan
42 under subsection (a), together with a copy of the plan, to the adult subject
43 to guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
HB 2359—Am. by HC 59
1 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and
2 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
3 determines. The notice must include a statement of the right to object to
4 the plan and must be given at the time of the filing.
5 (c) An adult subject to guardianship and any person entitled under
6 subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the guardian's plan may
7 object to the plan in writing no later than 21 days after the filing.
8 (d) The court shall review the guardian's plan filed under subsection
9 (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new plan. In
10 deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an objection
11 under subsection (c) and whether the plan is consistent with the guardian's
12 duties and powers under sections 76 and 77, and amendments thereto. The
13 court shall review an initial guardian's plan at the review hearing
14 scheduled under section 73(b), and amendments thereto. When reviewing
15 subsequent guardian's plans, the court has discretion whether to set the
16 matter for hearing but may not approve the plan until 30 days after the
17 filing.
18 (e) After the guardian's plan filed under this section is approved by
19 the court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the adult subject
20 to guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
21 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and
22 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
23 determines.
24 New Sec. 80. (a) A guardian for an adult shall file with the court at

39 (7) if the adult is living in a mental health facility or living in a
40 facility that provides the adult with healthcare or other personal services,

42 treatment or habilitation consistent with the adult's preferences, values,
43 prior directions and best interest;
HB 2359—Am. by HC 60
1 (8) anything of more than de minimis value which the guardian, any

6 between the guardian and the adult. A conflict of interest occurs where the
7 guardian has some personal, business or agency interest that could be
8 perceived as self-serving or adverse to the position or best interest of the
9 adult, including, but not limited to, being paid for providing caregiver
10 services to the adult;
11 (10) if a guardian has been granted financial authority under section
12 78(c) 78(e), and amendments thereto, an accounting that lists property

14 distributions during the period for which the report is made;
15 (11) a copy of the guardian's most recently approved plan under
16 section 79, and amendments thereto, and a statement whether the guardian
17 has deviated from the plan and, if so, how the guardian has deviated and
18 why;
19 (12) plans for future care and support of the adult;
20 (13) a recommendation as to the need for continued guardianship and
21 any recommended change in the scope of the guardianship, including
22 whether the condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable
23 of exercising rights previously removed; and
24 (14) whether any co-guardian or successor guardian appointed to
25 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve.
26 (c) A guardian for an adult shall file a special report with the court
27 upon the occurrence of any of the following:
28 (1) A change of address of the guardian;
29 (2) a change of residence or placement of the adult;

35 (5) the death of the adult; or
36 (6) a change in the circumstances of the guardian or the adult that
37 may constitute a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs where the
38 guardian has some personal, business or agency interest that could be
39 perceived as self-serving or adverse to the position or best interest of the
40 adult.
41 (d) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report submitted
42 under this section or a guardian's plan submitted under section 79, and
43 amendments thereto, interview the guardian or adult subject to
HB 2359—Am. by HC 61
1 guardianship or investigate any other matter involving the guardianship.
2 (e) Notice of the filing under this section of a guardian's report or
3 special report, together with a copy of the report, must be given to the
4 adult subject to guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section
5 73(e), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other
6 person the court determines. The notice and report must be given not later
7 than 14 days after the filing.
8 (f) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
9 submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to
10 determine whether:
11 (1) The report provides sufficient information to establish the
12 guardian has complied with the guardian's duties;
13 (2) the guardianship should continue; and
14 (3) the guardian's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
15 (g) If the court determines that there is reason to believe a guardian
16 for an adult has not complied with the guardian's duties or the
17 guardianship should be modified or terminated, the court:
18 (1) Shall notify the adult, the guardian and any other person entitled
19 to notice under section 73(e), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent
20 order;
21 (2) may require additional information from the guardian;

25 hold a hearing to consider removal of the guardian, termination of the
26 guardianship or a change in the powers granted to the guardian or terms of
27 the guardianship.
28 (h) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a guardian for
29 an adult are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine
30 whether to adjust the requested fees.
31 (i) A guardian for an adult may petition the court for approval of a
32 report filed under this section. The court after review may approve the

35 New Sec. 81. (a) The court may remove a guardian for an adult for
36 failure to perform the guardian's duties or for other good cause and appoint
37 a successor guardian to assume the duties of guardian.

39 guardian for an adult and appoint a successor guardian on:
40 (1) Petition of the adult, guardian or person interested in the welfare
41 of the adult, which contains allegations that, if true, would support a
42 reasonable belief that removal of the guardian and appointment of a
43 successor guardian may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a
HB 2359—Am. by HC 62
1 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
2 filed during the preceding six months;
3 (2) communication from the adult, guardian or person interested in
4 the welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that removal of
5 the guardian and appointment of a successor guardian may be appropriate;

25 New Sec. 82. (a) An adult subject to guardianship, the guardian for
26 the adult or a person interested in the welfare of the adult may petition for:
27 (1) Termination of the guardianship on the ground that a basis for
28 appointment under section 64, and amendments thereto, does not exist or
29 termination would be in the best interest of the adult or for other good
30 cause; or
31 (2) modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of
32 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause.
33 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
34 or modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on:
35 (1) Petition under subsection (a) which contains allegations that, if
36 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of
37 the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a
38 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
39 filed during the preceding six months;
40 (2) communication from the adult, guardian or person interested in
41 the welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that termination
42 or modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, including because
43 the functional needs of the adult or supports or services available to the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 63
1 adult have changed;
2 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
3 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
4 needs of the adult or supports or services available to the adult have
5 changed or a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less
6 restrictive alternative for meeting the adult's needs is available; or
7 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
8 interest of the adult.
9 (c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or of a hearing under
10 this section must be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the

15 amendments thereto, continues to exist.
16 (e) The court shall modify the powers granted to a guardian for an
17 adult if the powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the
18 abilities or limitations of the adult, the adult's supports or other
19 circumstances.
20 (f) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before
21 terminating or modifying a guardianship for an adult, the court shall
22 follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the adult which
23 apply to a petition for guardianship.
24 (g) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or
25 modify the terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to

4 or other property needed for the support, care, education, health or welfare
5 of the minor.
6 (b) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a
7 conservator for the property or financial affairs of an adult if the court
8 finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
9 (1) The adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs
10 because:
11 (A) Of a limitation in the adult's ability to receive and evaluate
12 information or make or communicate decisions, even with the use of
13 appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported
14 decision making; or
15 (B) the adult is missing, detained or unable to return to the United
16 States;
17 (2) appointment is necessary to:
18 (A) Avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the property
19 of the adult; or

25 (c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated
26 by demonstrated limitations and needs of the adult and issue orders that
27 will encourage development of the adult's maximum self-determination
28 and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a
29 limited conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conservatorship
30 or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the adult.

15 persons required to be listed in the petition under section 84(b)(1) through
16 (3), and amendments thereto, and any other person interested in the
17 respondent's welfare the court determines. Failure to give notice under this
18 subsection does not preclude the court from appointing a conservator.
19 (d) After the appointment of a conservator, notice of a hearing on a
20 petition for any other order under sections 83 through 118, and
21 amendments thereto, together with a copy of the petition, must be given to:

27 New Sec. 86. While a petition under section 84, and amendments

31 who is in fact dependent on the respondent. The court may appoint an
32 emergency conservator to assist in implementing the order.

4 the proceeding, including the potential loss of rights as a result of the
5 proceeding; and
6 (B) obtain the respondent's views about the appointment sought by
7 the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the
8 conservator's proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of
9 the proposed conservatorship.
10 (2) These explanations and discussions are not intended to be a
11 substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to inform
12 the respondent of the respondent's rights and the nature and purpose of the
13 proceeding.
14 (d) A court liaison appointed under subsection (b) for an adult may be
15 assigned any or all of the following duties, in the discretion of the

25 relating to the petition as directed by the court, including, but not limited
26 to, the respondent's family relationships, past conduct, the nature and
27 extent of any property or income of the respondent, whether the
28 respondent is likely to injure self or others and other matters as the court
29 may specify.

8 (5) any other matter the court directs.
9 (d) The costs of an investigation by a court liaison shall be assessed
10 as provided for in section 42, and amendments thereto.
11 New Sec. 88. (a) Unless the respondent in a proceeding for
12 appointment of a conservator is represented by an attorney, the court shall
13 appoint an attorney to represent the respondent, regardless of the
14 respondent's ability to pay. The court shall give preference in the
15 appointment of an attorney to any attorney who has represented the
16 respondent in other matters if the court has knowledge of that prior
17 representation or to an attorney whom the respondent has requested. Any
18 appointment made by the court shall terminate after the conservator's plan
19 has been approved and after any appeal from the appointment of a
20 conservator, unless the court continues the appointment by further order.
21 Thereafter, an attorney may be appointed by the court if requested, in
22 writing, by the adult subject to conservatorship, the conservator or upon
23 the court's own motion.

25 appointment of a conservator shall:

43 proceeding, including respondent's attorney fees, may be paid from the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 70
1 respondent's assets.
2 (d) The court shall appoint an attorney to represent a parent of a
3 minor who is the subject of a proceeding under section 84, and
4 amendments thereto, if the court determines the parent needs
5 representation.
6 New Sec. 89. (a) Upon the filing of the petition or any other time at
7 or before the hearing, if the contents of the petition or evidence at the
8 hearing support a prima facie case of the need for a conservator, the court
9 shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
10 conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
11 mental health center or community developmental disability organization,
12 or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant,
13 nurse practitioner, social worker or other professional appointed by the
14 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and
15 functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or
16 disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or otherwise have a
17 conflict of interest.

2 available by the court to counsel for all parties.
3 (d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation as
4 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
5 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this
6 section and that no further examination or evaluation should be required,
7 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an
8 examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be filed with

12 name and address of a qualified professional or facility willing and able to
13 conduct this examination and evaluation. If the court orders a further
14 examination and evaluation, the court may continue the trial and fix a new
15 date, time and place of the trial at a time not to exceed 30 days from the
16 date of the filing of the request.

39 in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court
40 shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
41 (d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
42 respondent at a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto.

2 plan and report. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest
3 of the respondent or individual subject to conservatorship or furthers the

36 those rights. The statement must be in plain language, in at least 16-point
37 font, and to the extent feasible, in a language in which the individual
38 subject to conservatorship is proficient. The statement must notify the

15 New Sec. 95. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
16 section 84, and amendments thereto, or on a verified petition by a person
17 interested in an individual's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
18 conservator for the individual if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
19 establish probable cause that:
20 (1) Appointment of an emergency conservator is necessary to prevent
21 imminent, substantial and irreparable harm to the individual's property or
22 financial interests;
23 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
24 circumstances; and
25 (3) a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and

27 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not
28 exceed 30 days and the emergency conservator may exercise only the
29 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency conservator's
30 authority may be extended up to three times for not more than 30 days per
31 extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions for
32 appointment of an emergency conservator under subsection (a) continue.
33 (c) Immediately on filing of a petition for an emergency conservator,
34 the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the

40 to the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court
41 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's property or
42 financial interests will be substantially and irreparably harmed before a
43 hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints
HB 2359—Am. by HC 77
1 an emergency conservator without giving notice under subsection (c), the
2 court must give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
3 appointment to:
4 (1) The respondent;

6 (3) any other person the court determines.
7 (e) Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold
8 a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.
9 (f) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is
10 not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator
11 under section 83, and amendments thereto.
12 (g) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under
13 this section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report

30 amendments thereto; or
31 (g) granting other appropriate relief.
32 New Sec. 97. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the
33 court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety, or require
34 an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on faithful
35 discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive the
36 requirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-protection
37 arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the individual
38 subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),
39 the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is in the
40 business of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the conservator's
41 service.

43 section must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 78

7 business in this state is not required to give a bond under this section.

16 submits to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office
17 to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the conservator
18 in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the proceeding must be
19 given to the surety at the address shown in the records of the court in
20 which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety then known to
21 the person required to provide the notice.
22 (3) On petition of a successor conservator or person affected by a
23 breach of the obligation of the bond, a proceeding may be brought against
24 the surety for breach of the obligation of the bond.
25 (4) A proceeding against the bond may be brought until liability

43 personal affairs. A conservator shall strive to assure that the personal, civil
HB 2359—Am. by HC 79
1 and human rights of the individual subject to conservatorship are
2 protected.
3 (c) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship,
4 the conservator shall make the decision that the conservator reasonably
5 believes the individual would make if able, unless doing so would fail to
6 preserve the resources needed to maintain the individual's well-being and
7 lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or
8 personal or financial interests of the individual. To determine the decision
9 the individual would make if able, the conservator shall consider the
10 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values and
11 actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the
12 conservator.
13 (d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (c)
14 because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably determine
15 the decision the individual subject to conservatorship probably would
16 make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the decision the
17 individual would make would fail to preserve resources needed to
18 maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise

20 interests of the individual, the conservator shall act in accordance with the
21 best interest of the individual. In determining the best interest of the

28 individual would consider, including consequences for others.
29 (e) Except when inconsistent with the conservator's duties under
30 subsections (a) through (d), a conservator shall invest and manage the
31 conservatorship estate as a prudent investor would, by considering:

33 and the conservatorship estate;
34 (2) general economic conditions;
35 (3) the possible effect of inflation or deflation;

42 appreciation of capital; and

HB 2359—Am. by HC 80
1 individual subject to conservatorship.

7 relevant to the investment and management of the conservatorship estate.

16 conservator and may examine the will or other donative, nominative or
17 appointive instrument of the individual.
18 (j) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real and
19 personal property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the
20 conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the
21 court finds:
22 (1) The property lacks sufficient equity; or
23 (2) insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the
24 conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the
25 individual.
26 (k) A conservator has access to and authority over a digital asset of
27 the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided by the
28 revised uniform fiduciary access to digital assets act or court order.

21 inventory of the conservatorship estate, together with an oath or
22 affirmation that the inventory is believed to be complete and accurate as
23 far as information permits. The inventory shall include all of the property
24 and assets of the conservatorship estate, including any sources of regular
25 income to the estate, and information about how property is titled and any
26 beneficiary designations, including pay-on-death and transfer-on-death
27 beneficiaries.
28 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the
29 individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under
30 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any
31 other person the court determines. The notice must be given not later than
32 14 days after the filing.
33 (c) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the
34 conservatorship estate and make them available for examination on
35 reasonable request of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian
36 for the individual, or any other person the conservator or the court
37 determines.
38 New Sec. 105. (a) A conservator shall file with the court a report in a
39 record regarding the administration of the conservatorship estate annually
40 unless the court otherwise directs, on resignation or removal, on
41 termination of the conservatorship, and at any other time the court directs.
42 (b) A report under subsection (a) must state or contain:
43 (1) An accounting that lists property included in the conservatorship
HB 2359—Am. by HC 87
1 estate and the receipts, disbursements, liabilities and distributions during
2 the period for which the report is made;
3 (2) a list of the services provided to the individual subject to
4 conservatorship;
5 (3) a statement whether the conservator has deviated from the
6 conservator's most recently approved plan and, if so, how the conservator
7 has deviated and why;
8 (4) a recommendation as to the need for continued conservatorship
9 and any recommended change in the scope of the conservatorship;
10 (5) to the extent feasible, a copy of the most recent reasonably
11 available financial statements evidencing the status of bank accounts,
12 investment accounts and mortgages or other debts of the individual subject
13 to conservatorship with account numbers and social security number
14 redacted;
15 (6) anything of more than de minimis value which the conservator,
16 any individual who resides with the conservator, or the spouse, parent,
17 child or sibling of the conservator has received from a person providing
18 goods or services to the individual subject to conservatorship;
19 (7) any business relation the conservator has with a person the
20 conservator has paid or that has benefited from the property of the
21 individual subject to conservatorship;
22 (8) whether any co-conservator or successor conservator appointed to
23 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve; and
24 (9) a copy of the bond renewal.
25 (c) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report under this
26 section or conservator's plan under section 103, and amendments thereto,
27 interview the individual subject to conservatorship or conservator, or
28 investigate any other matter involving the conservatorship. In connection
29 with the report, the court may order the conservator to submit the
30 conservatorship estate to appropriate examination in a manner the court
31 directs.
32 (d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report,
33 together with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual
34 subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f),
35 and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and other persons the
36 court determines. The notice and report must be given not later than 14
37 days after filing.
38 (e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
39 submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to
40 determine whether:
41 (1) The reports provide sufficient information to establish the
42 conservator has complied with the conservator's duties;
43 (2) the conservatorship should continue; and
HB 2359—Am. by HC 88
1 (3) the conservator's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
2 (f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator has
3 not complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship should
4 not continue, the court:
5 (1) Shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the
6 conservator and any other person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
7 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order;
8 (2) may require additional information from the conservator;
9 (3) may appoint a court liaison to interview the individual subject to
10 conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving the
11 conservatorship; and
12 (4) consistent with sections 112 and 113, and amendments thereto,
13 may hold a hearing to consider removal of the conservator, termination of
14 the conservatorship or a change in the powers granted to the conservator or
15 terms of the conservatorship.
16 (g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a conservator
17 are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to
18 adjust the requested fees.
19 (h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report filed
20 under this section. The court after review may approve the report. If the
21 court approves the report, there is a rebuttable presumption the report is
22 accurate as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
23 (i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report of a
24 conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities concerning a
25 matter adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person given notice of the
26 report or accounting.
27 (j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report filed
28 under this section discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims
29 and causes of action by a person given notice of the report and the hearing
30 as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
31 New Sec. 106. (a) The interest of an individual subject to
32 conservatorship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not
33 transferrable or assignable by the individual and is not subject to levy,
34 garnishment, or similar process for claims against the individual unless
35 allowed under section 110, and amendments thereto.
36 (b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract
37 after having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the
38 contract is void against the individual and the individual's property but is
39 enforceable against the person that contracted with the individual.
40 (c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual
41 subject to conservatorship with respect to property included in the
42 conservatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of this state
43 other than this act.
HB 2359—Am. by HC 89
1 New Sec. 107. A transaction involving a conservatorship estate which
2 is affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's fiduciary
3 duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction is
4 authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under
5 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order. A
6 transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale, encumbrance
7 or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate entered into by
8 the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the
9 spouse, descendant, sibling, agent or attorney of the conservator, or a
10 corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial
11 beneficial interest.
12 New Sec. 108. (a) A person that assists or deals with a conservator in
13 good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction
14 requiring a court order under section 102, and amendments thereto, is
15 protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in
16 question. Knowledge alone by a person that the person is dealing with a
17 conservator does not require the person to inquire into the existence of
18 authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's exercise
19 of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of office, or
20 otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that
21 pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper
22 application of the property.
23 (b) Protection under subsection (a) extends to a procedural
24 irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the
25 issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a
26 person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable
27 provisions in law of this state other than this act relating to a commercial
28 transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.
29 New Sec. 109. (a) If an individual subject to conservatorship dies, the
30 conservator shall deliver to the district court any will of the individual that
31 is in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representative
32 named in the will if feasible. The conservator shall give notice of the
33 delivery of the will under this section to any person entitled to notice under
34 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
35 (b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
36 conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate
37 as provided in section 113, and amendments thereto.
38 New Sec. 110. (a) A conservator may pay a claim against the
39 conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising
40 before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in
41 accordance with the priorities under subsection (d). A claimant may
42 present a claim by:
43 (1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of
HB 2359—Am. by HC 90
1 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and
2 the amount claimed; or
3 (2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court,
4 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
5 (b) A claim under subsection (a) is presented on receipt by the
6 conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the
7 claim, whichever occurs first. A presented claim is allowed, if it is not
8 disallowed in whole or in part, by the conservator in a record sent or
9 delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation.
10 Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to
11 a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court
12 order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls
13 until 30 days after disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of
14 limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.
15 (c) A claimant whose claim under subsection (a) has not been paid
16 may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred
17 by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment
18 or security by encumbering property included in the conservatorship
19 estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to
20 conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is
21 initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of
22 the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the
23 conservatorship estate.
24 (d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all
25 existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in
26 money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:
27 (1) Costs and expenses of administration;
28 (2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority under
29 law other than this act;
30 (3) a claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education,
31 health or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to
32 conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual
33 subject to conservatorship;
34 (4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and
35 (5) all other claims.
36 (e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under
37 subsection (d) over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
38 payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
39 (1) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without
40 sufficient funds to pay the basic living and healthcare expenses of the
41 individual subject to conservatorship; and
42 (2) the court authorizes the preference under section 102(a)(8), and
43 amendments thereto.
HB 2359—Am. by HC 91
1 (f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all
2 existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual
3 subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security
4 interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future
5 date.
6 New Sec. 111. (a) Except as otherwise agreed by a conservator, the
7 conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in a
8 fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the conservatorship
9 estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's representative
10 capacity in the contract or before entering into the contract.
11 (b) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from
12 control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission
13 occurring in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate only
14 if the conservator is personally at fault.
15 (c) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a
16 fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included
17 in the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of
18 administration of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against the
19 conservatorship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a
20 fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable for
21 the claim.
22 (d) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the
23 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting,
24 surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action.
25 New Sec. 112. (a) The court may remove a conservator for failure to
26 perform the conservator's duties or other good cause and appoint a
27 successor conservator to assume the duties of the conservator.
28 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a
29 conservator and appoint a successor on:
30 (1) Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator
31 or person interested in the welfare of the individual which contains
32 allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that removal of
33 the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appropriate, but
34 the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or
35 substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding six months;
36 (2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
37 conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
38 supports a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and
39 appointment of a successor may be appropriate;
40 (3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
41 interest of the individual subject to conservatorship; or
42 (4) determination by the court that the conservator's reports and
43 accountings are delinquent or deficient as filed.
HB 2359—Am. by HC 92
1 (c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or any hearing under
2 this section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the
3 conservator, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
4 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
5 determines.
6 (d) If the individual subject to conservatorship is not represented by
7 an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions
8 as in section 88, and amendments thereto. The court shall award
9 reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in section 42, and
10 amendments thereto.
11 (e) In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the
12 priorities under section 92, and amendments thereto.
13 (f) Not later than 30 days after appointing a successor conservator,
14 the court or court's designee shall give notice of the appointment to the
15 individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice
16 under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
17 New Sec. 113. (a) A conservatorship for a minor terminates on the
18 earliest of:
19 (1) A court order terminating the conservatorship;
20 (2) the minor becoming an adult except as provided in section 114,
21 and amendments thereto;
22 (3) emancipation of the minor; or
23 (4) death of the minor.
24 (b) A conservatorship for an adult terminates on order of the court or
25 when the adult dies.
26 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a
27 person interested in the welfare of the individual may petition for:
28 (1) Termination of the conservatorship on the ground that a basis for
29 appointment under section 83, and amendments thereto, does not exist or
30 termination would be in the best interest of the individual or for other good
31 cause; or
32 (2) modification of the conservatorship on the ground that the extent
33 of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
34 cause.
35 (d) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
36 or modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on:
37 (1) Petition under subsection (c) which contains allegations that, if
38 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of
39 the conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold
40 a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
41 filed within the preceding six months;
42 (2) a communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
43 conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
HB 2359—Am. by HC 93
1 supports a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the
2 conservatorship may be appropriate, including because the functional
3 needs of the individual or supports or services available to the individual
4 have changed;
5 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
6 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
7 needs or supports or services available to the individual have changed or a
8 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
9 alternative is available; or
10 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
11 interest of the individual.
12 (e) Notice of a petition under subsection (c) or of a hearing under this
13 section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the
14 conservator, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
15 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
16 determines.
17 (f) After the hearing, the court shall order termination unless it is
18 proven that a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and
19 amendments thereto, continues to exist.
20 (g) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the
21 powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities or
22 limitations of the individual subject to conservatorship, the individual's
23 supports or other circumstances.
24 (h) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before
25 terminating a conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures
26 to safeguard the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship which
27 apply to a petition for conservatorship.
28 (i) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to terminate or
29 modify the terms of the conservatorship has the right to retain an attorney
30 to represent the individual in this matter. If the individual is not
31 represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the
32 same conditions as in section 88, and amendments thereto. The court shall
33 award reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in section 42,
34 and amendments thereto.
35 (j) On termination of a conservatorship other than by reason of the
36 death of the individual subject to conservatorship, property of the

39 on approval by the court of the final report.
40 (k) On termination of a conservatorship by reason of the death of the
41 individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator promptly shall file a
42 final report and petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final
43 report. On approval of the final report, the conservator shall proceed
HB 2359—Am. by HC 94
1 expeditiously to distribute the conservatorship estate to the individual's
2 estate or as otherwise ordered by the court. The conservator may take
3 reasonable measures necessary to preserve the conservatorship estate until
4 distribution can be made.
5 (l) The court shall issue a final order of discharge on the approval by
6 the court of the final report and satisfaction by the conservator of any other
7 condition the court imposed on the conservator's discharge.
8 (m) Not later than 30 days after entering an order under this section,
9 the court or the court's designee shall give notice of the order to the adult
10 subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice under section
11 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
12 New Sec. 114. (a) A conservatorship for a minor may be extended
13 beyond the minor's 18th birthday if the minor consents or the court finds by
14 clear and convincing evidence that substantial harm to the minor's interests
15 is otherwise likely. A conservatorship may be extended under this section
16 until the minor reaches the age of 21 and may be extended for two
17 additional two-year periods upon the same finding by the court or upon
18 consent of the minor. Consent to the extension of a conservatorship may be
19 withdrawn at any time.
20 (b) Any request to extend a minor conservatorship under this section
21 must be accompanied by:
22 (1) A description of the funds or assets of the minor's estate which the
23 conservator proposes to distribute to the minor over an extended period
24 following the minor's 18th birthday;
25 (2) the factual basis upon which the conservator alleges the need for
26 such an extended distribution plan; and
27 (3) a proposed conservator's plan that describes how the distribution
28 will occur.
29 (c) The court shall appoint an attorney to represent the minor as
30 provided in section 88, and amendments thereto.
31 (d) After a hearing, the court may extend a conservatorship for a
32 minor and grant to the conservator the authority to establish an extended
33 distribution plan if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
34 (1) Substantial harm to the minor's interests is likely if the
35 conservatorship is not extended; and
36 (2) the plan approved by the court adequately provides for meeting
37 the expected needs of the minor from the minor's 18th birthday until the
38 final distribution of the funds or assets which the court authorizes to be set
39 aside or transferred from the estate are paid over to the minor, including
40 provisions for accelerated distribution in extraordinary circumstances,
41 which may require court approval.
42 (e) If the court orders a conservatorship for a minor to be extended
43 under this section, the court shall order the conservator to report any
HB 2359—Am. by HC 95
1 expenditure or transfer of funds or assets from the minor's estate for the
2 purposes of effectuating an extended distribution plan within the
3 conservator's next accounting.
4 (f) The court may extend the conservatorship with regard to specific
5 funds or assets of the minor's estate, even though other funds or assets of
6 the minor's estate are paid over to the minor upon the minor's becoming 18
7 years of age.
8 (g) The minor shall be without the power, voluntarily or involuntarily,
9 to sell, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, assign, alienate, anticipate, transfer
10 or convey any interest in the principal or the income from any funds or
11 assets of the minor's estate set aside or transferred to effectuate a plan for
12 extended distribution until such is actually paid to the minor.
13 New Sec. 115. (a) Unless a person required to transfer funds or other
14 property to a minor knows that a conservator for the minor has been
15 appointed or a proceeding is pending for conservatorship, the person may
16 transfer an amount or value not exceeding $25,000 in a 12-month period
17 to:
18 (1) A person that has care or custody of the minor and with whom the
19 minor resides;
20 (2) a guardian for the minor;
21 (3) a custodian under the uniform transfers to minors act; or
22 (4) a financial institution as a deposit in an interest-bearing account or
23 certificate solely in the name of the minor and shall give notice to the
24 minor of the deposit.
25 (b) A person that transfers funds or other property under this section
26 is not responsible for its proper application.
27 (c) A person that receives funds or other property for a minor under
28 subsection (a)(1) or (2) may apply it only to the support, care, education,
29 health or welfare of the minor, and may not derive a personal financial
30 benefit from it, except for reimbursement for necessary expenses. Funds
31 not applied for these purposes must be preserved for the future support,
32 care, education, health or welfare of the minor, and the balance, if any,
33 transferred to the minor when the minor becomes an adult or otherwise is
34 emancipated.
35 (d) Any accumulated balance under this section shall be subject to
36 other provisions of this act.
37 New Sec. 116. The parent of a minor has the right and responsibility
38 to hold in trust and manage for the minor's benefit all of the personal and
39 real property vested in such minor when the total of such property does not
40 exceed $25,000 in value, unless a guardian or conservator has been
41 appointed for the minor.
42 New Sec. 117. (a) Any court having either control over or possession
43 of any amount of money not exceeding $100,000, the right to which is
HB 2359—Am. by HC 96
1 vested in a minor, shall have the discretion to authorize, without the
2 appointment of a conservator or the giving of bond, and notwithstanding
3 the authority of a parent as provided for in section 116, and amendments
4 thereto, the deposit of the money in a savings account of a bank, credit
5 union, savings and loan association or any other investment account that
6 the court may authorize, payable either to a conservator, if one shall be
7 appointed for the minor, or to the minor upon attaining 18 years of age.
8 (b) Any court having either control over or possession of any amount
9 of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested in a minor,
10 shall have the discretion to order the payment of the money to any person,
11 including the parent of the minor, or the minor. If the person is the
12 conservator for the minor, the court may waive or recommend the waiver
13 of the requirement of a bond. If the person is anyone other than the minor,
14 the court shall order that person to hold in trust and manage the minor's
15 estate for the minor's benefit.
16 New Sec. 118. Any court having either control over or possession of
17 any amount of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested
18 in an adult subject to guardianship, shall have the discretion to authorize,
19 without the appointment of a conservator or the giving of bond, the deposit
20 of the money in a savings account of a bank, credit union or savings and
21 loan association, payable to the guardian for the benefit of the adult subject
22 to guardianship if authorized pursuant to section 78(c) 78(e), and
23 amendments thereto, payable to a conservator, if one shall be appointed for
24 the adult, or payable to the adult subject to guardianship upon termination
25 of the guardianship.
26 New Sec. 119. (a) On receiving a petition for a guardianship for an
27 adult, a court may order a protective arrangement instead of guardianship
28 as a less restrictive alternative to guardianship.
29 (b) On receiving a petition for a conservatorship for an individual, a
30 court may order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship as a
31 less restrictive alternative to conservatorship.
32 (c) A person interested in an adult's welfare, including the adult or a
33 conservator for the adult, may petition under sections 119 through 130,
34 and amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of
35 guardianship.
36 (d) The following persons may petition under sections 119 through

38 conservatorship:
39 (1) The individual for whom the protective arrangement is sought;

6 arrangement instead of guardianship if the court finds by clear and
7 convincing evidence that:

18 arrangement is in the minor's best interest, and:
19 (1) If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any
20 recommendation of the parent whether an arrangement is in the minor's

23 Sec. 144. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 58-656 is hereby amended to read as
24 follows: 58-656. (a) An attorney in fact who elects to act under a power of
25 attorney is under a duty to act in the interest of the principal and to avoid
26 conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact so to act.
27 A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power of attorney
28 who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the power of
29 attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers conferred in the
30 best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing and conflicts of
31 interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the trustee's beneficiary
32 or beneficiaries. The attorney in fact shall keep a record of receipts,
33 disbursements and transactions made on behalf of the principal and shall
34 not comingle funds or assets of the principal with the funds or assets of the
35 attorney in fact. In the absence of explicit authorization, the attorney in
36 fact shall exercise a high degree of care in maintaining, without
37 modification, any estate plan which the principal may have in place,
38 including, but not limited to, arrangements made by the principal for
39 disposition of assets at death through beneficiary designations, ownership
40 by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, trust arrangements or by will or
41 codicil. Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney or in a separate
42 agreement between the principal and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact
43 who elects to act shall exercise the authority granted in a power of attorney
HB 2359—Am. by HC 121
1 with that degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person
2 dealing with the property and conducting the affairs of another, except that
3 all investments made on or after July 1, 2003, shall be in accordance with
4 the provisions of the Kansas uniform prudent investor act, K.S.A. 58-
5 24a01 et seq., and amendments thereto. If the attorney in fact has special
6 skills or was appointed attorney in fact on the basis of representations of
7 special skills or expertise, the attorney in fact has a duty to use those skills
8 in the principal's behalf.
9 (b) On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's
10 behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, an
11 attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the principal, to
12 communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow the instructions
13 of the principal.
14 (c) If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court of
15 the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, guardian of the estate or
16 other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's
17 property or all of the principal's property except specified exclusions, the
18 attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal.
19 The fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the durable power of
20 attorney that the principal would have had if the principal were not an
21 adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or conservator or both as
22 defined by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 59-3051 section 25, and amendments
23 thereto.
24 (d) A principal may nominate by a power of attorney, a guardian or
25 conservator, or both, for consideration by the court. If a petition to appoint
26 a guardian or conservator, or both, is filed, the court shall make the
27 appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination in
28 the power of attorney, so long as the individual nominated is a fit and
29 proper person.
30 (e) An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the
31 principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of
32 attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the principal's
33 legal representative or a court, and the oral and written instructions of the
34 principal, or the written instructions of the principal's legal representative
35 or a court.
36 (f) An attorney in fact may be instructed in a power of attorney that
37 the authority granted shall not be exercised until, or shall terminate on, the
38 happening of a future event, condition or contingency, as determined in a
39 manner prescribed in the instrument.
40 (g) On the death of the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow the
41 instructions of the court, if any, having jurisdiction over the estate of the
42 principal, or any part thereof, and shall communicate with and be
43 accountable to the principal's personal representative, or if none, the
HB 2359—Am. by HC 122
1 principal's successors. The attorney in fact shall promptly deliver to and
2 put in the possession and control of the principal's personal representative
3 or successors, any property of the principal and copies of any records of
4 the attorney in fact relating to transactions undertaken in the principal's
5 behalf that are deemed by the personal representative or the court to be
6 necessary or helpful in the administration of the decedent's estate.
7 (h) If an attorney in fact has a property or contract interest in the
8 subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact is
9 otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the principal, this
10 section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact that would
11 conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.
12 Sec. 145. K.S.A. 58-662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 58-
13 662. (a) The principal may petition the court for an accounting by the
14 principal's attorney in fact or the legal representative of the attorney in
15 fact. If the principal is disabled or deceased, a petition for accounting may
16 be filed by the principal's legal representative, an adult member of the
17 principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the principal.
18 (b) Any requirement for an accounting may be waived or an
19 accounting may be approved by the court without hearing, if the
20 accounting is waived or approved by a principal who is not disabled, or by
21 a principal whose legal capacity has been restored, or by all creditors and
22 distributees of a deceased principal's estate whose claims or distributions
23 theretofore have not been satisfied in full. The approval or waiver shall be
24 in writing, signed by the affected persons and filed with the court.
25 (c) For the purposes of subsection (b), a legal representative or a
26 person providing services to the principal's estate shall not be considered a
27 creditor of the principal's estate. No express approval or waiver shall be
28 required from the legal representative of a disabled principal if the
29 principal's legal capacity has been restored, or from the personal
30 representative of a deceased principal's estate, or from any other person
31 entitled to compensation or expense for services rendered to a disabled or
32 deceased principal's estate, unless the principal or the principal's estate is
33 unable to pay in full the compensation and expense to which the person
34 rendering the services may be entitled.
35 (d) The principal, the principal's attorney in fact, an adult member of
36 the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
37 principal may petition the district court in the county where the principal is
38 then residing to determine and declare whether a principal, who has
39 executed a power of attorney, is a disabled person.
40 (e) If the principal is a disabled person, on petition of the principal's
41 legal representative, an adult member of the principal's family or any
42 interested person, including a person interested in the welfare of the
43 principal, for good cause shown, the court may:
HB 2359—Am. by HC 123
1 (1) Order the attorney in fact to exercise or refrain from exercising
2 authority in a durable power of attorney in a particular manner or for a
3 particular purpose;
4 (2) modify the authority of an attorney in fact under a durable power
5 of attorney;
6 (3) declare suspended a power of attorney that is nondurable;
7 (4) terminate a durable power of attorney;
8 (5) remove the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;
9 (6) confirm the authority of an attorney in fact or a successor attorney
10 in fact to act under a durable power of attorney; and
11 (7) issue such other orders as the court finds will be in the best
12 interest of the disabled principal, including appointment of a conservator
13 for the principal pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050, et seq. the Kansas uniform
14 guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements act,
15 sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto.
16 (f) In addition to any other remedies available under law, if after
17 notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a showing that
18 the principal is a disabled person and that the attorney in fact has breached
19 such attorney in fact's fiduciary duty to the principal or that there is a
20 reasonable likelihood that such attorney in fact may do so in the immediate
21 future, the court, in its discretion, may issue an order that some or all of
22 the authority granted by the durable power of attorney be suspended or
23 modified, and that a different attorney in fact be authorized to exercise
24 some or all of the powers granted by the durable power of attorney. Such
25 attorney in fact may be designated by the court. The court may require any
26 person petitioning for any such order to file a bond in such amount and
27 with such sureties as required by the court to indemnify either the attorney
28 in fact who has been acting on behalf of the principal or the principal and
29 the principal's successors in interest for the expenses, including attorney
30 fees, incurred by any such persons with respect to such proceeding. The
31 court, after hearing, may allow payment or enter judgment. None of the
32 actions described in this subsection shall be taken by the court until after
33 hearing upon reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified
34 statement supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action
35 identifying the immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons
36 known to the petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal.
37 Except that in the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the
38 court, without notice, may enter such temporary order as seems proper to
39 the court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than 30
40 days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to the
41 persons identified as herein provided in this subsection.
42 (g) If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court or
43 the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an
HB 2359—Am. by HC 124
1 accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property
2 belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the
3 attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a
4 successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.
5 (h) In a proceeding under this act or in any other proceeding, or upon
6 petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:
7 (1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a power of attorney to
8 account;
9 (2) authorize the attorney in fact under a power of attorney to enter
10 into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any
11 transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is, was
12 or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power to
13 authorize for a conservator pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050 et seq. the Kansas
14 uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements
15 act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto; and
16 (3) relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise authority
17 for a disabled principal under a durable power of attorney.
18 (i) Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation,
19 any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach of
20 duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has received
21 an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter unless a
22 proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within two years
23 after receipt of the account or statement by the principal or, if the principal
24 is a disabled person, by a guardian or conservator of the disabled person's
25 estate. If a disabled person has no guardian or conservator of the disabled
26 person's estate at the time an account or statement is presented, then the
27 cause of action shall not be barred until one year after the removal of the
28 principal's disability or incapacity, one year after the appointment of a
29 conservator for the principal or one year after the death of the principal.
30 The cause of action thus barred does not include any action to recover
31 from an attorney in fact or successor for fraud, misrepresentation or
32 concealment related to the settlement of any transaction involving the
33 agency relationship of the attorney in fact with the principal.

38 (c) this state does not have jurisdiction under either subsection (a) or

41 welfare of the minor may petition the court to terminate the guardianship,

23 New Sec. 63. (a) At any time, the court may require the guardian of a
24 minor, or the guardian of a minor may choose, to develop and file with the

24 (1) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and

27 for physical health, safety or self-care because the respondent is unable to
28 receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even
29 with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported
30 decision making; and
31 (B) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective
32 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative; or
33 (2) with appropriate findings, treat the petition as one for a
34 conservatorship under sections 83 through 118, and amendments thereto,
35 or a protective arrangement under sections 119 through 130, and

17 respondent's welfare the court determines. Failure to give notice under this
18 subsection does not preclude the court from appointing a guardian.

37 the petitioner, including views about a proposed guardian, the guardian's
38 proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of the proposed
39 guardianship.
40 (2) These explanations and discussions are not intended to be a
41 substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to inform

9 requested. Any appointment made by the court shall terminate after the
10 guardian's plan has been approved and after any appeal from the
11 appointment of a guardian, unless the court continues the appointment by
12 further order. Thereafter, an attorney may be appointed by the court if
13 requested, in writing, by the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, or
14 upon the court's own motion.

36 New Sec. 69. (a) Upon the filing of the petition or any other time at
37 or before the hearing, if the contents of the petition or evidence at the

39 shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
40 conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
41 mental health center, community developmental disability organization or
42 by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant,
43 nurse practitioner, social worker or other professional appointed by the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 42
1 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and
2 functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or
3 disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or otherwise have a
4 conflict of interest.
5 (b) Unless otherwise specified by the court, the report of the
6 examination and evaluation submitted to the court shall contain:
7 (1) The respondent's name, age and date of birth;

21 relied upon in the preparation of this evaluation;
22 (7) the date and location where this examination and evaluation
23 occurred, and the name or names of the professional or professionals
24 performing the examination and evaluation and such professional's
25 qualifications;

39 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
40 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this

42 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an
43 examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be filed with

HB 2359—Am. by HC 43
1 the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at least four days
2 prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request shall be a statement
3 of the reasons why an examination and evaluation is requested and the

7 date, time and place of the trial at a time not to exceed 30 days from the
8 date of the filing of the request.
9 New Sec. 70. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
10 hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may not proceed unless
11 the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the
12 respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings typically

14 alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent
15 to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.
16 (b) A hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may
17 proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
18 and convincing evidence that:

20 been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences
21 of failing to do so; or
22 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and

31 subsection for good cause may request permission from the court for
32 access to court records of the guardianship, including the guardian's report
33 and plan. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest of the
34 respondent or adult subject to guardianship or furthers the public interest
35 and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of the adult.

11 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence

4 New Sec. 74. (a) Not later than 14 days after the appointment, a

14 rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, in plain language
15 and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject to
16 guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to
17 guardianship of the right to:
18 (1) Seek termination or modification of the guardianship, or removal
19 of the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these
20 matters;

31 dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility or
32 other facility that places restrictions on the individual's ability to leave or

43 (B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of

HB 2359—Am. by HC 48
1 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
2 or
3 (C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
4 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
5 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction
6 is:
7 (i) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
8 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
9 (ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
10 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult;
11 (8) receive a copy of the guardian's plan under section 79, and
12 amendments thereto, and the guardian's report under section 80, and
13 amendments thereto; and
14 (9) object to the guardian's plan or report.
15 (c) Any person required to provide notice under this section shall file
16 proof of service of such notice with the court.
17 New Sec. 75. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
18 section 65, and amendments thereto, or on verified petition by a person
19 interested in an adult's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
20 guardian for the adult if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
21 establish probable cause that:
22 (1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
23 imminent and substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety or
24 welfare;
25 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
26 circumstances; and
27 (3) a basis for appointment of a guardian under section 64, and
28 amendments thereto, exists.
29 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult
30 may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only
31 the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency
32 guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for not more than
33 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions
34 for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (a) continue.
35 (c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an
36 emergency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to
37 represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided
38 in subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a
39 hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the respondent's
40 attorney and any other person the court determines.
41 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult
42 without notice to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the court
43 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physical health,

HB 2359—Am. by HC 49
1 safety or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice
2 on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency
3 guardian without giving notice under subsection (c), the court must:
4 (1) Give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
5 appointment to:
6 (A) The respondent;
7 (B) the respondent's attorney; and
8 (C) any other person the court determines; and
9 (2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later
10 than five days after the appointment.
11 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a
12 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under
13 section 64, and amendments thereto.
14 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
15 this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the
16 court requires.
17 New Sec. 76. (a) A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary. A guardian
18 shall strive to assure that the personal, civil and human rights of the
19 individual subject to guardianship are protected. Except as otherwise
20 limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions regarding
21 the support, care, education, health and welfare of the adult subject to
22 guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's limitations and in
23 accordance with the guardian's plan under section 79, and amendments
24 thereto.
25 (b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the
26 adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, include the adult in decision
27 making, and encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act on the
28 adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the
29 adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
30 (1) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and
31 maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular
32 visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities
33 and physical and mental health;
34 (2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and
35 preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the
36 adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities or
37 social interactions; and
38 (3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive
39 relationships and services for the adult.
40 (c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care,
41 diligence and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for
42 the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
43 (1) Take reasonable care of the personal effects and service or support

HB 2359—Am. by HC 50
1 animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or
2 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect
3 the adult's property;
4 (2) if authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
5 thereto, expend funds and other property of the adult received by the
6 guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health
7 and welfare;
8 (3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended
9 under paragraph (2) for the adult's future needs, but if a conservator has
10 been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other property at least
11 quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the adult's future needs;
12 and
13 (4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services,
14 provided to the adult.
15 (d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
16 guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the
17 adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would
18 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
19 interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to
20 guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's
21 previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, cultural practices,
22 religious beliefs, values and actions, to the extent actually known or
23 reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
24 (e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under subsection
25 (d) because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine
26 the decision the adult probably would make if able, or the guardian
27 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
28 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
29 interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best
30 interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the adult, the
31 guardian shall consider:
32 (1) Information received from professionals and persons that
33 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;
34 (2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have
35 considered if the adult were able to act; and
36 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult
37 would consider, including consequences for others.
38 (f) A guardian for an adult shall notify the court immediately if the
39 condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising
40 rights previously removed.
41 New Sec. 77. (a) Except as limited by court order, a guardian for an
42 adult may:
43 (1) If authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments

HB 2359—Am. by HC 51
1 thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
2 adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application or
3 receipt is within the powers of the conservator;
4 (2) establish the adult's place of dwelling;
5 (3) consent to health, including mental health, or other care, treatment
6 or service for the adult;
7 (4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed, commence a
8 proceeding including an administrative proceeding, or take other
9 appropriate action to compel another person to support the adult or pay
10 funds for the adult's benefit; and
11 (5) receive personally identifiable healthcare information regarding
12 the adult.
13 (b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
14 to consent to the adoption of the adult.
15 (c) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
16 to litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce, dissolution or
17 annulment of marriage of the individual subject to guardianship, including
18 negotiation of a settlement thereof.
19 (d) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (b)
20 or (c), the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in
21 accordance with the adult's preferences, values and prior directions and
22 whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.
23 (e) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(2) to
24 establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:
25 (1) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would
26 select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making
27 standard in section 76(d) and (e), and amendments thereto. If the guardian
28 does not know and cannot reasonably determine what setting the adult
29 subject to guardianship probably would choose if able, or the guardian
30 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
31 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
32 interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance with section
33 76(e), and amendments thereto, a residential setting that is consistent with
34 the adult's best interest;
35 (2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a
36 residential setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with
37 persons important to the adult and meet the adult's needs in the least
38 restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
39 inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 76(d) and (e),
40 and amendments thereto;
41 (3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the adult:
42 (A) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult and any person
43 identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 52
1 guardian or a subsequent order; and
2 (B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new dwelling
3 and state whether the adult received advance notice of the change and
4 whether the adult objected to the change;
5 (4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult to
6 a nursing home, mental health facility or other facility that places
7 restrictions on the adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
8 (A) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under section
9 79, and amendments thereto;
10 (B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or
11 (C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at least 14
12 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons entitled
13 to notice under section 73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent
14 order, and no objection is filed;
15 (5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside this
16 state only if consistent with the guardian's plan and authorized by the court
17 by specific order; and
18 (6) take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the lease
19 to the primary dwelling of the adult only if:
20 (A) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan under
21 section 79, and amendments thereto;
22 (B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or
23 (C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the action to
24 the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under section 73(e)(2), and
25 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order and no objection has been
26 filed.
27 (f) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(3) to make
28 healthcare decisions, the guardian shall:
29 (1) Involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably
30 feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting the
31 adult in understanding the risks and benefits of healthcare options;
32 (2) act in accordance with any declaration of the adult made pursuant
33 to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109, and amendments
34 thereto; and
35 (3) take into account:
36 (A) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
37 (B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult, if known
38 or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
39 New Sec. 78. (a) A guardian for an adult may shall not initiate the
40 commitment of the adult to a mental health facility except in accordance
41 with the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons, K.S.A. 59-2945 et
42 seq., and amendments thereto.
43 (b) A guardian for an adult may shall not restrict the ability of the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 53
1 adult to communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
2 visitors and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or
3 electronic communications, including through social media, or
4 participating in social activities, unless:
5 (1) Authorized by the court by specific order;
6 (2) a protective order or a protective arrangement instead of
7 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
8 or
9 (3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
10 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
11 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult and the restriction is:
12 (A) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
13 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
14 (B) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
15 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult.
16 (c) A guardian for an adult may shall not consent, on behalf of the
17 adult, to:
18 (1) Any psychosurgery, removal of any bodily organ or amputation of
19 any limb, unless such surgery, removal or amputation has been approved
20 in advance by the court, except in an emergency and when necessary to
21 preserve the life of the adult or to prevent serious and irreparable
22 impairment to the physical health of the adult;
23 (2) the sterilization of the adult, unless approved by the court
24 following a due process hearing held for the purposes of determining
25 whether to approve such, and during which hearing the adult is represented
26 by an attorney appointed by the court;
27 (3) the performance of any experimental biomedical or behavioral
28 procedure on the adult, or for the adult to be a participant in any
29 biomedical or behavioral experiment, without the prior review and
30 approval of such by either an institutional review board as provided for in
31 title 45, part 46 of the code of federal regulations, or if such regulations do
32 not apply, then by a review committee established by the agency,
33 institution or treatment facility at which the procedure or experiment is
34 proposed to occur, composed of members selected for the purposes of
35 determining whether the proposed procedure or experiment:
36 (A) Does not involve any significant risk of harm to the physical or
37 mental health of the adult, or the use of aversive stimulants, and is
38 intended to preserve the life or health of the adult or to assist the adult to
39 develop or regain skills or abilities; or
40 (B) involves a significant risk of harm to the physical or mental
41 health of the adult, or the use of an aversive stimulant, but that the
42 conducting of the proposed procedure or experiment is intended either to
43 preserve the life of the adult, or to significantly improve the quality of life

HB 2359—Am. by HC 54
1 of the adult, or to assist the adult to develop or regain significant skills or
2 abilities, and that the guardian has been fully informed concerning the
3 potential risks and benefits of the proposed procedure or experiment or of
4 any aversive stimulant proposed to be used, and as to how and under what
5 circumstances the aversive stimulant may be used, and has specifically
6 consented to such;
7 (4) the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-sustaining
8 medical care, treatment, services or procedures, except:
9 (A) In accordance with the provisions of any declaration of the adult
10 made pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109,
11 and amendments thereto; or
12 (B) if the adult, prior to the court's appointment of a guardian, has
13 executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions pursuant to
14 K.S.A. 58-625, et seq., and amendments thereto, and that durable power of
15 attorney has not previously been revoked by the adult, and it includes any
16 provision relevant to the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
17 sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures, then the
18 guardian shall have the authority to act as provided for in that power of
19 attorney, even if the guardian has revoked or amended that power of
20 attorney pursuant to the authority of K.S.A. 58-627, and amendments
21 thereto; or
22 (C) in the circumstances where the adult's treating physician certifies
23 in writing to the guardian that the adult is in a persistent vegetative state or
24 is suffering from an illness or other medical condition for which further
25 treatment, other than for the relief of pain, would not likely prolong the life
26 of the adult other than by artificial means, nor would be likely to restore to
27 the adult any significant degree of capabilities beyond those the adult
28 currently possesses, and which opinion is concurred in by either a second
29 physician or by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the
30 healthcare provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing
31 such circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
32 order which would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
33 saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures.
34 The court shall review the written certification within 72 hours at a due
35 process hearing during which the adult is represented by an attorney
36 appointed by the court. The court may request that the state protection and
37 advocacy agency as provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or K.S.A. 74-
38 5515(a)(2)(A) and (B), and amendments thereto, or 42 U.S.C. 15043, 42
39 U.S.C. 10805 or 29 U.S.C. 794e represent the adult. Upon completion of
40 the hearing, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
41 adult meets the conditions set forth in this section, the court shall approve
42 the written certification. If the court does not find by clear and convincing
43 evidence that the adult meets the conditions set forth in this section, then

HB 2359—Am. by HC 55
1 the written certification shall not be approved in accordance with
2 subsection (d) or (e).
3 (d) (1) It shall be presumed that every adult under guardianship
4 has directed such adult's guardian to direct the adult's healthcare
5 providers to provide such adult with nutrition or hydration or both to
6 a degree that is sufficient to sustain life. No court, guardian or any
7 person shall have the authority to make a decision on behalf of an
8 adult who is legally incapable of making healthcare decisions to
9 withhold or withdraw nutrition or hydration or both from such adult
10 except if:
11 (A) The adult, when legally capable of making healthcare
12 decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
13 directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawal of
14 nutrition or hydration or both under the adult's current
15 circumstances. Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a
16 declaration or a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions
17 described in subsection (c)(4); or
18 (B) the adult's treating physician certifies in writing that, in the
19 physician's reasonable medical judgment:
20 (i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
21 would hasten death; or
22 (ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
23 nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not contribute to
24 sustaining the adult's life.
25 (2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawing nutrition or
26 hydration or both under paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with
27 the court with the written certification from the adult's treating
28 physician.
29 (B) Notice of such filing shall be provided to the adult subject to
30 guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
31 guardianship and any other person whom the court determines at the
32 time of filing of the petition.
33 (C) The court shall appoint an attorney for the adult. The court
34 may request that the state protection and advocacy agency as
35 provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments
36 thereto, or 42 U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e,
37 represent the adult.
38 (D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
39 thereafter as the court is available.
40 (E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawing
41 nutrition or hydration or both unless the court finds by clear and
42 convincing evidence that:
43 (i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult

HB 2359—Am. by HC 56
1 would hasten death; or
2 (ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
3 nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not
4 contribute to sustaining the adult's life.
5 (3) (A) A cause of action for injunctive relief may be maintained:
6 (i) Against any person who is reasonably believed to be about to
7 violate or who is in the course of violating this subsection; or
8 (ii) to secure a court determination, notwithstanding the position
9 of a guardian, that the adult legally incapable of making healthcare
10 decisions, when legally capable of making such decisions, executed
11 expressly and with informed consent, a written directive to withdraw
12 or withhold hydration or nutrition or both in the applicable
13 circumstances. Such written directive shall be presumed valid unless
14 there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
15 (B) The action may be brought by any person who is:
16 (i) The spouse, parent, child or sibling of the adult;
17 (ii) a current healthcare provider of the adult;
18 (iii) the guardian of the adult;
19 (iv) the state protection and advocacy agency as provided by
20 K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments thereto, or 42
21 U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e; or
22 (v) a public official with appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the
23 laws of this state.
24 (C) Pending the final determination of the court, the court shall
25 direct that nutrition or hydration or both be provided to such adult
26 unless the court determines that paragraph (3)(A) is applicable.
27 (e) (1) No court, guardian or any person shall have the authority
28 to make a decision on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of
29 making healthcare decisions to withhold or withdraw life-saving or
30 life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures from
31 such adult except if:
32 (A) The adult, when legally capable of making healthcare
33 decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
34 directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawing of
35 life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
36 procedures from such adult under the adult's current circumstances.
37 Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a declaration or a
38 durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions described in
39 subsection (c)(4); or
40 (B) (i) The adult's treating physician certifies in writing to the
41 guardian that the adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
42 sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong
43 the dying process; and

HB 2359—Am. by HC 57
1 (ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or
2 by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
3 provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
4 circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
5 order that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
6 saving or life-sustaining medical care.
7 (2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
8 sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures under
9 paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with the court with the
10 written certification from the adult's treating physician.
11 (B) Notice of such filing shall be provided to the adult subject to
12 guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
13 guardianship and any other person whom the court determines at the
14 time of filing of the petition.
15 (C) The court shall appoint an attorney for the adult. The court
16 may request that the state protection and advocacy agency as
17 provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments
18 thereto, or 42 U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e,
19 represent the adult.
20 (D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
21 thereafter as the court is available.
22 (E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawal of
23 life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
24 procedures unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
25 that:
26 (i) The adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
27 sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong
28 the dying process; and
29 (ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or
30 by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
31 provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
32 circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
33 order that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
34 saving or life-sustaining medical care.
35 (f) A guardian for an adult may shall not exercise any control or
36 authority over the adult's estate, unless specifically authorized by the court.
37 Any guardian who is granted such authority must shall prepare an
38 inventory and provide notice of the inventory as provided in section 104,
39 and amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to the
40 guardian and may waive the requirement of the posting of a bond, only if:
41 (1) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by the
42 adult equals $25,000 or less; and
43 (2) either the court requires the guardian to report to the court the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 58
1 commencement of the exercising of such authority, or requires the
2 guardian to obtain court authorization to commence the exercise of such
3 authority, as the court shall specify; and
4 (3) the court also requires the guardian, whenever the combined value
5 of such funds and property exceeds $25,000, to:
6 (A) File a guardian's plan as provided for in section 79, and
7 amendments thereto, that contains elements similar to those that would be
8 contained in a conservator's plan as provided for in section 103, and
9 amendments thereto;
10 (B) petition the court for appointment of a conservator; or
11 (C) notify the court as the court shall specify that the value of the
12 adult's estate has equaled or exceeded $25,000, if the court has earlier
13 appointed a conservator but did not issue letters of conservatorship
14 pending such notification;
15 (e)(g) A guardian for an adult may shall not access digital assets of
16 the adult except if unless authorized by the court pursuant to K.S.A. 2024
17 Supp. 58-4814, and amendments thereto.
18 New Sec. 79. (a) Not later than 60 days after appointment and when
19 there is a significant change in circumstances, or the guardian seeks to
20 deviate significantly from the existing guardian's plan, a guardian for an
21 adult shall file with the court a plan for the care of the adult. The plan must
22 be based on the needs of the adult and take into account the best interest of
23 the adult as well as the adult's preferences, values and prior directions, to
24 the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. The
25 guardian shall include in the plan:
26 (1) The living arrangement, services and supports the guardian

1 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
2 filed during the preceding six months;

29 termination would be in the best interest of the adult or for other good
30 cause; or
31 (2) modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of
32 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause.
33 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
34 or modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on:
35 (1) Petition under subsection (a) which contains allegations that, if

37 the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a
38 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
39 filed during the preceding six months;
40 (2) communication from the adult, guardian or person interested in
41 the welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that termination

6 restrictive alternative for meeting the adult's needs is available; or
7 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
8 interest of the adult.
9 (c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or of a hearing under
10 this section must be given to the adult subject to guardianship, the
11 guardian, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and amendments

25 (c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated

27 will encourage development of the adult's maximum self-determination
28 and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a

30 or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the adult.

15 persons required to be listed in the petition under section 84(b)(1) through
16 (3), and amendments thereto, and any other person interested in the
17 respondent's welfare the court determines. Failure to give notice under this
18 subsection does not preclude the court from appointing a conservator.

7 the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the

25 relating to the petition as directed by the court, including, but not limited
26 to, the respondent's family relationships, past conduct, the nature and

10 as provided for in section 42, and amendments thereto.
11 New Sec. 88. (a) Unless the respondent in a proceeding for

15 appointment of an attorney to any attorney who has represented the
16 respondent in other matters if the court has knowledge of that prior
17 representation or to an attorney whom the respondent has requested. Any
18 appointment made by the court shall terminate after the conservator's plan
19 has been approved and after any appeal from the appointment of a
20 conservator, unless the court continues the appointment by further order.
21 Thereafter, an attorney may be appointed by the court if requested, in
22 writing, by the adult subject to conservatorship, the conservator or upon

9 shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
10 conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
11 mental health center or community developmental disability organization,
12 or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant,

14 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and
15 functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or

19 examination and evaluation submitted to the court shall contain:
20 (1) The respondent's name, age and date of birth;

1 examination and evaluation ordered by the court. The report shall be made
2 available by the court to counsel for all parties.
3 (d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation as
4 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
5 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this
6 section and that no further examination or evaluation should be required,
7 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an
8 examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be filed with
9 the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at least four days
10 prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request shall be a statement

18 hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may not proceed unless
19 the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the
20 respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings typically

22 alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent
23 to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.
24 (b) A hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may
25 proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
26 and convincing evidence that:
27 (1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after having
28 been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences
29 of failing to do so;
30 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
31 participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services or
32 technological assistance; or
33 (3) the respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and
34 attendance would be harmful to the minor.
35 (c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 85, and
36 amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing,
37 assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of

39 in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court
40 shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
41 (d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
42 respondent at a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto.

15 person's participation.

43 this section for good cause may request permission from the court for

HB 2359—Am. by HC 73
1 access to court records of the conservatorship, including the conservator's
2 plan and report. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest
3 of the respondent or individual subject to conservatorship or furthers the
4 public interest and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of
5 the respondent or individual.
6 (c) A report under section 87, and amendments thereto, of a court
7 liaison or professional evaluation under section 89, and amendments
8 thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

32 (6) a person nominated as conservator by the spouse, adult child or
33 other close family member of the respondent.
34 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection (a),
35 the court shall select as conservator the person the court considers best
36 qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider
37 the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's skills, the
38 expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the person and the
39 respondent have similar values and preferences and the likelihood the
40 person will be able to perform the duties of a conservator successfully.
41 (c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
42 decline to appoint as conservator a person having priority under subsection
43 (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.

HB 2359—Am. by HC 74
1 (d) The following persons shall not be appointed as conservator

16 (b) A court order appointing a conservator for an adult must:
17 (1) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence has

19 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
20 alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services, technological
21 assistance or supported decision making; and
22 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
23 established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the
24 petition.
25 (c) A court order establishing a full conservatorship for an adult must
26 state the basis for granting a full conservatorship and include specific
27 findings to support the conclusion that a limited conservatorship would not

30 specific property placed under the control of the conservator and the
31 powers granted to the conservator.

16 (g) If an individual subject to conservatorship is an adult, the spouse
17 and adult children of the adult subject to conservatorship are entitled under
18 subsection (e) to notice unless the court determines notice would be
19 contrary to the preferences or prior directions of the adult subject to
20 conservatorship or not in the best interest of the adult.
21 (h) If an individual subject to conservatorship is a minor, each parent
22 and adult sibling of the minor is entitled under subsection (e) to notice

29 order of appointment.
30 (b) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a conservator under
31 section 93, and amendments thereto, the court or the court's designee shall
32 give to the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any

41 removal of the conservator, and choose an attorney to represent the
42 individual in these matters;

15 New Sec. 95. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
16 section 84, and amendments thereto, or on a verified petition by a person
17 interested in an individual's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
18 conservator for the individual if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
19 establish probable cause that:
20 (1) Appointment of an emergency conservator is necessary to prevent
21 imminent, substantial and irreparable harm to the individual's property or
22 financial interests;
23 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
24 circumstances; and
25 (3) a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and
26 amendments thereto, exists.
27 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not
28 exceed 30 days and the emergency conservator may exercise only the
29 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency conservator's

37 given to the respondent, the respondent's attorney and any other person the
38 court determines.

40 to the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court
41 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's property or
42 financial interests will be substantially and irreparably harmed before a
43 hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints

HB 2359—Am. by HC 77
1 an emergency conservator without giving notice under subsection (c), the
2 court must give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
3 appointment to:
4 (1) The respondent;

6 (3) any other person the court determines.
7 (e) Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold
8 a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.
9 (f) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is
10 not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator
11 under section 83, and amendments thereto.
12 (g) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under
13 this section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report

31 (g) granting other appropriate relief.
32 New Sec. 97. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the
33 court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety, or require
34 an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on faithful
35 discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive the
36 requirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-protection
37 arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the individual
38 subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),
39 the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is in the
40 business of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the conservator's
41 service.
42 (b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this
43 section must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 78

7 business in this state is not required to give a bond under this section.

11 New Sec. 98. (a) The following rules apply to the bond required
12 under section 97, and amendments thereto:
13 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the bond, the surety and the
14 conservator are jointly and severally liable.
15 (2) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety
16 submits to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office
17 to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the conservator
18 in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the proceeding must be
19 given to the surety at the address shown in the records of the court in
20 which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety then known to
21 the person required to provide the notice.
22 (3) On petition of a successor conservator or person affected by a
23 breach of the obligation of the bond, a proceeding may be brought against
24 the surety for breach of the obligation of the bond.
25 (4) A proceeding against the bond may be brought until liability
26 under the bond is exhausted.

37 prudence, loyalty, reasonable care and diligence to the individual subject to
38 conservatorship.
39 (b) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the
40 individual subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible, encourage
41 the individual to participate in decisions, act on the individual's own
42 behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the individual's
43 personal affairs. A conservator shall strive to assure that the personal, civil

HB 2359—Am. by HC 79
1 and human rights of the individual subject to conservatorship are
2 protected.
3 (c) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship,
4 the conservator shall make the decision that the conservator reasonably
5 believes the individual would make if able, unless doing so would fail to
6 preserve the resources needed to maintain the individual's well-being and
7 lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or
8 personal or financial interests of the individual. To determine the decision
9 the individual would make if able, the conservator shall consider the
10 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values and
11 actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the
12 conservator.
13 (d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (c)
14 because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably determine
15 the decision the individual subject to conservatorship probably would
16 make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the decision the
17 individual would make would fail to preserve resources needed to
18 maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise
19 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
20 interests of the individual, the conservator shall act in accordance with the
21 best interest of the individual. In determining the best interest of the
22 individual, the conservator shall consider:
23 (1) Information received from professionals and persons that
24 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the individual;
25 (2) other information the conservator believes the individual would
26 have considered if the individual were able to act; and
27 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the
28 individual would consider, including consequences for others.
29 (e) Except when inconsistent with the conservator's duties under
30 subsections (a) through (d), a conservator shall invest and manage the
31 conservatorship estate as a prudent investor would, by considering:
32 (1) The circumstances of the individual subject to conservatorship
33 and the conservatorship estate;
34 (2) general economic conditions;
35 (3) the possible effect of inflation or deflation;
36 (4) the expected tax consequences of an investment decision or
37 strategy;
38 (5) the role of each investment or course of action in relation to the
39 conservatorship estate as a whole;
40 (6) the expected total return from income and appreciation of capital;
41 (7) the need for liquidity, regularity of income and preservation or
42 appreciation of capital; and
43 (8) the special relationship or value, if any, of specific property to the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 80
1 individual subject to conservatorship.
2 (f) The propriety of a conservator's investment and management of
3 the conservatorship estate is determined in light of the facts and
4 circumstances existing when the conservator decides or acts and not by
5 hindsight.
6 (g) A conservator shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts
7 relevant to the investment and management of the conservatorship estate.
8 (h) A conservator that has special skills or expertise, or is named
9 conservator in reliance on the conservator's representation of special skills
10 or expertise, has a duty to use the special skills or expertise in carrying out
11 the conservator's duties.
12 (i) In investing, selecting specific property for distribution, and
13 invoking a power of revocation or withdrawal for the use or benefit of the
14 individual subject to conservatorship, a conservator shall consider any

17 appointive instrument of the individual.
18 (j) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real and
19 personal property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the
20 conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the
21 court finds:

23 (2) insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the
24 conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the
25 individual.
26 (k) A conservator has access to and authority over a digital asset of
27 the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided by the
28 revised uniform fiduciary access to digital assets act or court order.

24 appointment and stated in the letters of office, and unless contrary to a

HB 2359—Am. by HC 83
1 (c) In making an expenditure or distribution under this section, the
2 conservator shall consider:
3 (1) The size of the conservatorship estate, the estimated duration of
4 the conservatorship and the likelihood the individual subject to
5 conservatorship, at some future time, may be fully self-sufficient and able
6 to manage the individual's financial affairs and the conservatorship estate;
7 (2) the accustomed standard of living of the individual subject to
8 conservatorship and individual who is dependent on the individual subject

18 advance for services to be provided to the individual subject to
19 conservatorship or individual who is dependent on the individual subject

21 performed and advance payment is customary or reasonably necessary
22 under the circumstances.
23 New Sec. 102. (a) Except as otherwise ordered by the court, a
24 conservator must give notice to persons entitled to notice under section
25 85(d), and amendments thereto, and receive specific authorization by the
26 court before the conservator may exercise, with respect to the
27 conservatorship, the power to:

16 conservatorship estate, including an irrevocable trust which will enable the
17 individual subject to conservatorship to qualify for benefits from any
18 federal, state or local government program, or which will accelerate the
19 individual's qualification for such benefits, whether or not the trust extends
20 beyond the duration of the conservatorship;
21 (12) revoke or amend a trust revocable by the individual subject to
22 conservatorship pursuant to K.S.A. 58a-411 or 58a-602, and amendments

36 (b) The court shall set the matter for hearing and, if the individual
37 subject to conservatorship is not represented by an attorney, shall appoint
38 an attorney to represent the individual.
39 (c) In approving a conservator's exercise of a power listed in
40 subsection (a), the court shall consider primarily the decision the
41 individual subject to conservatorship would make if able, to the extent the
42 decision can be ascertained.
43 (d) To determine under subsection (b) the decision the individual

HB 2359—Am. by HC 85
1 subject to conservatorship would make if able, the court shall consider the
2 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values and
3 actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the
4 conservator. The court shall also consider:
5 (1) The financial needs of the individual subject to conservatorship
6 and individuals who are in fact dependent on the individual subject to
7 conservatorship for support, and the interests of creditors of the individual;
8 (2) possible reduction of income, estate, inheritance or other tax
9 liabilities;
10 (3) eligibility for governmental assistance;
11 (4) the previous pattern of giving or level of support provided by the
12 individual;
13 (5) any existing estate plan or lack of estate plan of the individual;
14 (6) the life expectancy of the individual and the probability the
15 conservatorship will terminate before the individual's death; and
16 (7) any other relevant factor.
17 New Sec. 103. (a) Not later than 60 days after appointment, and
18 whenever there is a significant change in circumstances or the conservator
19 seeks to deviate significantly from the existing conservator's plan, a
20 conservator shall file with the court a plan for protecting, managing,
21 expending and distributing the assets of the conservatorship estate. The
22 plan must be based on the needs of the individual subject to
23 conservatorship and take into account the best interest of the individual as
24 well as the individual's preferences, values and prior directions, to the
25 extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The
26 conservator shall include in the plan:
27 (1) A budget containing projected expenses and resources, including
28 an estimate of the total amount of fees the conservator anticipates charging
29 per year and a statement or list of the amount the conservator proposes to
30 charge for each service the conservator anticipates providing to the
31 individual;
32 (2) how the conservator will involve the individual in decisions about
33 management of the conservatorship estate;
34 (3) any step the conservator plans to take to develop or restore the
35 ability of the individual to manage the conservatorship estate; and
36 (4) an estimate of the duration of the conservatorship.
37 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of the conservator's
38 plan under subsection (a), together with a copy of the plan, to the
39 individual subject to conservatorship, any attorney representing the
40 individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under
41 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any
42 other person the court determines. The notice must include a statement of
43 the right to object to the plan and must be given at the time of the filing.

HB 2359—Am. by HC 86
1 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled
2 under subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the conservator's plan
3 may object to the plan in writing not later than 21 days after the filing.
4 (d) The court shall review the conservator's plan filed under
5 subsection (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new
6 plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an
7 objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is consistent with the
8 conservator's duties and powers. The court shall review an initial
9 conservator's plan at the review hearing scheduled under section 93(e), and
10 amendments thereto. For subsequent conservator's plans, the court has
11 discretion whether to set the matter for hearing but may not approve the
12 plan until 30 days after the filing.
13 (e) After a conservator's plan under this section is approved by the
14 court, the conservator shall provide a copy of the plan to the individual
15 subject to conservatorship, any attorney representing the individual subject
16 to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
17 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
18 determines.
19 New Sec. 104. (a) Not later than 60 days after appointment, a
20 conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing court a detailed
21 inventory of the conservatorship estate, together with an oath or
22 affirmation that the inventory is believed to be complete and accurate as
23 far as information permits. The inventory shall include all of the property
24 and assets of the conservatorship estate, including any sources of regular
25 income to the estate, and information about how property is titled and any
26 beneficiary designations, including pay-on-death and transfer-on-death
27 beneficiaries.
28 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the
29 individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under
30 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any
31 other person the court determines. The notice must be given not later than
32 14 days after the filing.
33 (c) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the
34 conservatorship estate and make them available for examination on
35 reasonable request of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian
36 for the individual, or any other person the conservator or the court
37 determines.
38 New Sec. 105. (a) A conservator shall file with the court a report in a
39 record regarding the administration of the conservatorship estate annually
40 unless the court otherwise directs, on resignation or removal, on
41 termination of the conservatorship, and at any other time the court directs.
42 (b) A report under subsection (a) must state or contain:
43 (1) An accounting that lists property included in the conservatorship

HB 2359—Am. by HC 87
1 estate and the receipts, disbursements, liabilities and distributions during
2 the period for which the report is made;
3 (2) a list of the services provided to the individual subject to
4 conservatorship;
5 (3) a statement whether the conservator has deviated from the
6 conservator's most recently approved plan and, if so, how the conservator
7 has deviated and why;
8 (4) a recommendation as to the need for continued conservatorship
9 and any recommended change in the scope of the conservatorship;
10 (5) to the extent feasible, a copy of the most recent reasonably
11 available financial statements evidencing the status of bank accounts,
12 investment accounts and mortgages or other debts of the individual subject
13 to conservatorship with account numbers and social security number
14 redacted;
15 (6) anything of more than de minimis value which the conservator,
16 any individual who resides with the conservator, or the spouse, parent,
17 child or sibling of the conservator has received from a person providing
18 goods or services to the individual subject to conservatorship;
19 (7) any business relation the conservator has with a person the
20 conservator has paid or that has benefited from the property of the
21 individual subject to conservatorship;
22 (8) whether any co-conservator or successor conservator appointed to
23 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve; and
24 (9) a copy of the bond renewal.
25 (c) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report under this
26 section or conservator's plan under section 103, and amendments thereto,
27 interview the individual subject to conservatorship or conservator, or
28 investigate any other matter involving the conservatorship. In connection
29 with the report, the court may order the conservator to submit the
30 conservatorship estate to appropriate examination in a manner the court
31 directs.
32 (d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report,
33 together with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual
34 subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f),
35 and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and other persons the
36 court determines. The notice and report must be given not later than 14
37 days after filing.
38 (e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
39 submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to
40 determine whether:
41 (1) The reports provide sufficient information to establish the
42 conservator has complied with the conservator's duties;
43 (2) the conservatorship should continue; and

HB 2359—Am. by HC 88
1 (3) the conservator's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
2 (f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator has
3 not complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship should
4 not continue, the court:
5 (1) Shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the
6 conservator and any other person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
7 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order;
8 (2) may require additional information from the conservator;
9 (3) may appoint a court liaison to interview the individual subject to
10 conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving the
11 conservatorship; and
12 (4) consistent with sections 112 and 113, and amendments thereto,
13 may hold a hearing to consider removal of the conservator, termination of
14 the conservatorship or a change in the powers granted to the conservator or
15 terms of the conservatorship.
16 (g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a conservator
17 are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to
18 adjust the requested fees.
19 (h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report filed
20 under this section. The court after review may approve the report. If the
21 court approves the report, there is a rebuttable presumption the report is
22 accurate as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
23 (i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report of a
24 conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities concerning a
25 matter adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person given notice of the
26 report or accounting.
27 (j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report filed
28 under this section discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims
29 and causes of action by a person given notice of the report and the hearing
30 as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
31 New Sec. 106. (a) The interest of an individual subject to
32 conservatorship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not
33 transferrable or assignable by the individual and is not subject to levy,
34 garnishment, or similar process for claims against the individual unless
35 allowed under section 110, and amendments thereto.
36 (b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract
37 after having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the
38 contract is void against the individual and the individual's property but is
39 enforceable against the person that contracted with the individual.
40 (c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual
41 subject to conservatorship with respect to property included in the
42 conservatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of this state
43 other than this act.

HB 2359—Am. by HC 89
1 New Sec. 107. A transaction involving a conservatorship estate which
2 is affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's fiduciary
3 duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction is
4 authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under
5 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order. A
6 transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale, encumbrance
7 or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate entered into by
8 the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the
9 spouse, descendant, sibling, agent or attorney of the conservator, or a
10 corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial
11 beneficial interest.
12 New Sec. 108. (a) A person that assists or deals with a conservator in
13 good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction
14 requiring a court order under section 102, and amendments thereto, is
15 protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in
16 question. Knowledge alone by a person that the person is dealing with a
17 conservator does not require the person to inquire into the existence of
18 authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's exercise
19 of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of office, or
20 otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that
21 pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper
22 application of the property.
23 (b) Protection under subsection (a) extends to a procedural
24 irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the
25 issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a
26 person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable
27 provisions in law of this state other than this act relating to a commercial
28 transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.
29 New Sec. 109. (a) If an individual subject to conservatorship dies, the
30 conservator shall deliver to the district court any will of the individual that
31 is in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representative
32 named in the will if feasible. The conservator shall give notice of the
33 delivery of the will under this section to any person entitled to notice under
34 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
35 (b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
36 conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate
37 as provided in section 113, and amendments thereto.
38 New Sec. 110. (a) A conservator may pay a claim against the
39 conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising
40 before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in
41 accordance with the priorities under subsection (d). A claimant may
42 present a claim by:
43 (1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of

HB 2359—Am. by HC 90
1 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and
2 the amount claimed; or
3 (2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court,
4 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
5 (b) A claim under subsection (a) is presented on receipt by the
6 conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the
7 claim, whichever occurs first. A presented claim is allowed, if it is not
8 disallowed in whole or in part, by the conservator in a record sent or
9 delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation.
10 Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to
11 a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court
12 order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls
13 until 30 days after disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of
14 limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.
15 (c) A claimant whose claim under subsection (a) has not been paid
16 may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred
17 by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment
18 or security by encumbering property included in the conservatorship
19 estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to
20 conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is
21 initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of
22 the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the
23 conservatorship estate.
24 (d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all
25 existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in
26 money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:
27 (1) Costs and expenses of administration;
28 (2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority under
29 law other than this act;
30 (3) a claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education,
31 health or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to
32 conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual
33 subject to conservatorship;
34 (4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and
35 (5) all other claims.
36 (e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under
37 subsection (d) over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
38 payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
39 (1) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without
40 sufficient funds to pay the basic living and healthcare expenses of the
41 individual subject to conservatorship; and
42 (2) the court authorizes the preference under section 102(a)(8), and
43 amendments thereto.

HB 2359—Am. by HC 91
1 (f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all
2 existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual
3 subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security
4 interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future

25 attorney is under a duty to act in the interest of the principal and to avoid
26 conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact so to act.
27 A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power of attorney
28 who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the power of
29 attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers conferred in the
30 best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing and conflicts of
31 interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the trustee's beneficiary
32 or beneficiaries. The attorney in fact shall keep a record of receipts,
33 disbursements and transactions made on behalf of the principal and shall
34 not comingle funds or assets of the principal with the funds or assets of the
35 attorney in fact. In the absence of explicit authorization, the attorney in
36 fact shall exercise a high degree of care in maintaining, without
37 modification, any estate plan which the principal may have in place,
38 including, but not limited to, arrangements made by the principal for
39 disposition of assets at death through beneficiary designations, ownership
40 by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, trust arrangements or by will or
41 codicil. Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney or in a separate
42 agreement between the principal and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact
43 who elects to act shall exercise the authority granted in a power of attorney

HB 2359—Am. by HC 121
1 with that degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person
2 dealing with the property and conducting the affairs of another, except that
3 all investments made on or after July 1, 2003, shall be in accordance with
4 the provisions of the Kansas uniform prudent investor act, K.S.A. 58-
5 24a01 et seq., and amendments thereto. If the attorney in fact has special
6 skills or was appointed attorney in fact on the basis of representations of
7 special skills or expertise, the attorney in fact has a duty to use those skills
8 in the principal's behalf.
9 (b) On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's
10 behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, an
11 attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the principal, to
12 communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow the instructions
13 of the principal.
14 (c) If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court of
15 the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, guardian of the estate or
16 other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's
17 property or all of the principal's property except specified exclusions, the
18 attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal.
19 The fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the durable power of
20 attorney that the principal would have had if the principal were not an
21 adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or conservator or both as
22 defined by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 59-3051 section 25, and amendments
23 thereto.

25 conservator, or both, for consideration by the court. If a petition to appoint
26 a guardian or conservator, or both, is filed, the court shall make the
27 appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination in
28 the power of attorney, so long as the individual nominated is a fit and
29 proper person.
30 (e) An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the
31 principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of
32 attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the principal's
33 legal representative or a court, and the oral and written instructions of the
34 principal, or the written instructions of the principal's legal representative
35 or a court.
36 (f) An attorney in fact may be instructed in a power of attorney that
37 the authority granted shall not be exercised until, or shall terminate on, the
38 happening of a future event, condition or contingency, as determined in a
39 manner prescribed in the instrument.
40 (g) On the death of the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow the
41 instructions of the court, if any, having jurisdiction over the estate of the
42 principal, or any part thereof, and shall communicate with and be
43 accountable to the principal's personal representative, or if none, the

HB 2359—Am. by HC 122
1 principal's successors. The attorney in fact shall promptly deliver to and
2 put in the possession and control of the principal's personal representative
3 or successors, any property of the principal and copies of any records of
4 the attorney in fact relating to transactions undertaken in the principal's
5 behalf that are deemed by the personal representative or the court to be
6 necessary or helpful in the administration of the decedent's estate.
7 (h) If an attorney in fact has a property or contract interest in the
8 subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact is
9 otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the principal, this
10 section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact that would
11 conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.

HB 2359—Am. by HC 123

16 (f) In addition to any other remedies available under law, if after
17 notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a showing that
18 the principal is a disabled person and that the attorney in fact has breached
19 such attorney in fact's fiduciary duty to the principal or that there is a
20 reasonable likelihood that such attorney in fact may do so in the immediate
21 future, the court, in its discretion, may issue an order that some or all of
22 the authority granted by the durable power of attorney be suspended or
23 modified, and that a different attorney in fact be authorized to exercise
24 some or all of the powers granted by the durable power of attorney. Such
25 attorney in fact may be designated by the court. The court may require any
26 person petitioning for any such order to file a bond in such amount and
27 with such sureties as required by the court to indemnify either the attorney
28 in fact who has been acting on behalf of the principal or the principal and
29 the principal's successors in interest for the expenses, including attorney
30 fees, incurred by any such persons with respect to such proceeding. The
31 court, after hearing, may allow payment or enter judgment. None of the
32 actions described in this subsection shall be taken by the court until after
33 hearing upon reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified
34 statement supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action
35 identifying the immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons
36 known to the petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal.
37 Except that in the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the
38 court, without notice, may enter such temporary order as seems proper to
39 the court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than 30
40 days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to the
41 persons identified as herein provided in this subsection.
42 (g) If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court or
43 the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an

HB 2359—Am. by HC 124
1 accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property
2 belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the
3 attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a
4 successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.
5 (h) In a proceeding under this act or in any other proceeding, or upon
6 petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:
7 (1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a power of attorney to
8 account;
9 (2) authorize the attorney in fact under a power of attorney to enter
10 into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any
11 transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is, was
12 or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power to
13 authorize for a conservator pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050 et seq. the Kansas
14 uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements
15 act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto; and
16 (3) relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise authority
17 for a disabled principal under a durable power of attorney.
18 (i) Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation,
19 any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach of
20 duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has received
21 an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter unless a
22 proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within two years
23 after receipt of the account or statement by the principal or, if the principal
24 is a disabled person, by a guardian or conservator of the disabled person's
25 estate. If a disabled person has no guardian or conservator of the disabled
26 person's estate at the time an account or statement is presented, then the
27 cause of action shall not be barred until one year after the removal of the
28 principal's disability or incapacity, one year after the appointment of a
29 conservator for the principal or one year after the death of the principal.
30 The cause of action thus barred does not include any action to recover
31 from an attorney in fact or successor for fraud, misrepresentation or
32 concealment related to the settlement of any transaction involving the
33 agency relationship of the attorney in fact with the principal.
