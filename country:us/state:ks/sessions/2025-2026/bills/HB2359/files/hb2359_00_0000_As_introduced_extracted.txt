9 guardianship or conservatorship transferred from another state does not
10 affect the ability of the guardian or conservator to seek appointment as

30 guardian for the minor's current needs for support, care, education, health,
31 safety and welfare;

28 court. Any guardian who is granted such authority must prepare an
29 inventory and provide notice of the inventory as provided in section 104,

6 New Sec. 62. (a) Guardianship under this act for a minor terminates:
7 (1) On the minor's death, adoption, emancipation or attainment of
8 majority; or

12 (A) Termination of the guardianship would be harmful to the minor;
13 and
14 (B) the minor's interest in the continuation of the guardianship
15 outweighs the interest of any parent of the minor in restoration of the
16 parent's right to make decisions for the minor.
17 (b) A minor subject to guardianship or a person interested in the
18 welfare of the minor may petition the court to terminate the guardianship,

32 (f) When terminating a guardianship for a minor under this section,
33 the court may issue an order providing for transitional arrangements that
34 will assist the minor with a transition of custody and is in the best interest
35 of the minor.

37 guardian to facilitate transition of the guardian's responsibilities and
38 protect the best interest of the minor.
39 (h) Not later than 30 days after entering an order under this section,
40 the court or the court's designee shall give notice of the order to the minor

20 parent of the minor, a person entitled to notice under section 56(d), and
21 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
22 determines. The notice shall include a statement of the right to object to
23 the plan and shall be given at the time of the filing.
24 (c) The minor, a parent of the minor and any person entitled under
25 subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the guardian's plan may

30 consider an objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is
31 consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under sections 59 and 60,
32 and amendments thereto. The court may not approve the plan until 30 days
33 after the filing.

35 the court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the minor if the

42 New Sec. 64. (a) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court
43 may:
HB 2359 36
1 (1) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and
2 convincing evidence that:
3 (A) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements
4 for physical health, safety or self-care because the respondent is unable to
5 receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even
6 with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported
7 decision making; and
8 (B) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective
9 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative; or
10 (2) with appropriate findings, treat the petition as one for a
11 conservatorship under sections 83 through 118, and amendments thereto,
12 or a protective arrangement under sections 119 through 130, and
13 amendments thereto, issue any appropriate order or dismiss the
14 proceeding.
15 (b) The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (a)
16 only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and limitations
17 of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the
18 respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court
19 may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, protective
20 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternatives
21 would meet the needs of the respondent.

31 guardianship program;
32 (5) the reason a guardianship is necessary, including a description of:

14 the petitioner, including views about a proposed guardian, the guardian's
15 proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of the proposed
16 guardianship.
17 (2) These explanations and discussions are not intended to be a
18 substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to inform

25 it is reasonably believed the respondent will live if the appointment is
26 made;
27 (3) obtain information from any physician or other provider known to

29 requested. Any appointment made by the court shall terminate after the
30 guardian's plan has been approved and after any appeal from the

17 conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
18 mental health center, community developmental disability organization or
19 by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant,
20 nurse practitioner, social worker or other professional appointed by the
21 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and
22 functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or
23 disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or otherwise have a
24 conflict of interest.
25 (b) Unless otherwise specified by the court, the report of the
26 examination and evaluation submitted to the court shall contain:
27 (1) The respondent's name, age and date of birth;

11 (c) The professional shall file with the court, at least five days prior to

14 available by the court to counsel for all parties.
15 (d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation as
16 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
17 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this
18 section and that no further examination or evaluation should be required,
19 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an
20 examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be filed with
21 the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at least four days
22 prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request shall be a statement
23 of the reasons why an examination and evaluation is requested and the
24 name and address of a qualified professional or facility willing and able to
25 conduct this examination and evaluation. If the court orders a further
26 examination and evaluation, the court may continue the trial and fix a new
27 date, time and place of the trial at a time not to exceed 30 days from the
28 date of the filing of the request.
29 New Sec. 70. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
30 hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may not proceed unless
31 the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the
32 respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings typically
33 are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the hearing at an
34 alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent
35 to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.
36 (b) A hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may
37 proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
38 and convincing evidence that:
39 (1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after having
40 been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences
41 of failing to do so; or
42 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and

6 in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court
7 shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
8 (d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
9 respondent at a hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto.
10 (e) At a hearing held under section 66, and amendments thereto, the

28 (1) The respondent or individual subject to guardianship requests the

30 (2) either:
31 (A) The petition for guardianship is dismissed; or

7 (4) A person not otherwise entitled to access court records under this
8 subsection for good cause may request permission from the court for
9 access to court records of the guardianship, including the guardian's report
10 and plan. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest of the
11 respondent or adult subject to guardianship or furthers the public interest
12 and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of the adult.
13 (c) A report under section 67, and amendments thereto, of a court
14 liaison or a professional evaluation under section 69, and amendments
15 thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

25 court orders for good cause.
26 New Sec. 72. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the
27 court in appointing a guardian for an adult shall consider persons qualified
28 to be guardian in the following order of priority:
29 (1) A guardian, other than a temporary or emergency guardian,
30 currently acting for the respondent in another jurisdiction;
31 (2) a person nominated as guardian by the respondent, including the

39 close family member of the respondent.
40 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection (a),
41 the court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best
42 qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider
43 the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's skills, the
HB 2359 45
1 expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the person and the
2 respondent have similar values and preferences and the likelihood the
3 person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian successfully.
4 (c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
5 decline to appoint as guardian a person having priority under subsection
6 (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.
7 (d) In determining whether the appointment of a proposed guardian is
8 in the best interest of the respondent, the court shall consider the number
9 of other cases in which the proposed guardian, other than a corporation, is
10 currently serving as guardian, particularly if that number is more than 15.
11 (e) The following persons shall not be appointed as guardian unless
12 the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is the best
13 qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the
14 best interest of the respondent:
15 (1) A person that provides paid services to the respondent, or an
16 individual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the
17 respondent, or is the spouse, parent or child of an individual who provides
18 or is employed to provide paid services to the respondent;
19 (2) an owner, operator or employee of any entity at which the
20 respondent is receiving care; and
21 (3) a person who provides care or other services, or is an employee of
22 an agency, partnership or corporation that provides care or other services
23 to persons with needs similar to those of the respondent.
24 New Sec. 73. (a) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult
25 must:
26 (1) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
27 established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a
28 protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive
29 alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services, technological
30 assistance or supported decision making; and
31 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
32 established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the
33 petition.
34 (b) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must
35 state the basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific findings
36 that support the conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the
37 functional needs of the adult subject to guardianship.

41 date of a review hearing to be set 90 days after the order of appointment is
42 entered. At that hearing, the court shall review the guardian's plan filed
43 pursuant to section 79, and amendments thereto.
HB 2359 46
1 (e) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an
2 adult, shall identify any person that subsequently is entitled to:

6 (3) notice that the guardian will be unavailable to visit the adult for
7 more than two months or unavailable to perform the guardian's duties for

18 (8) notice of a petition or hearing to remove the guardian or that the
19 court has removed the guardian.
20 (f) A spouse and adult children of an adult subject to guardianship are
21 entitled to notice under subsection (e) unless the court determines notice
22 would be contrary to the preferences or prior directions of the adult subject
23 to guardianship or not in the best interest of the adult.
24 New Sec. 74. (a) Not later than 14 days after the appointment, a
25 guardian appointed under section 72, and amendments thereto, shall give

27 section 66, and amendments thereto, a copy of the order of appointment.
28 (b) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a guardian under

31 entitled to notice under section 72(e), and amendments thereto, or a
32 subsequent order a statement of the rights of the adult subject to
33 guardianship and procedures to seek relief if the adult is denied those
34 rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, in plain language
35 and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject to
36 guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to
37 guardianship of the right to:
38 (1) Seek termination or modification of the guardianship, or removal
39 of the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these
40 matters;
41 (2) file a grievance against the guardian under section 50, and
42 amendments thereto;
43 (3) be involved in decisions affecting the adult, including decisions

4 (4) be involved in healthcare decision making to the extent
5 reasonably feasible and supported in understanding the risks and benefits
6 of healthcare options to the extent reasonably feasible;
7 (5) be notified at least 14 days before a change in the adult's primary
8 dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility or
9 other facility that places restrictions on the individual's ability to leave or
10 have visitors unless the change or move is proposed in the guardian's plan
11 under section 79, and amendments thereto, or authorized by the court by
12 specific order;
13 (6) object to a change or move described in paragraph (5) and the
14 process for objecting;
15 (7) communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
16 visitors, and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or

18 (A) The guardian has been authorized by the court by specific order
19 to restrict communications, visits or interactions;
20 (B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of
21 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
22 or
23 (C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
24 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
25 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction
26 is:
27 (i) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
28 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
29 (ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
30 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult;
31 (8) receive a copy of the guardian's plan under section 79, and

35 (c) Any person required to provide notice under this section shall file
36 proof of service of such notice with the court.
37 New Sec. 75. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
38 section 65, and amendments thereto, or on verified petition by a person
39 interested in an adult's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
40 guardian for the adult if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
41 establish probable cause that:
42 (1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
43 imminent and substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety or
HB 2359 48
1 welfare;
2 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
3 circumstances; and
4 (3) a basis for appointment of a guardian under section 64, and
5 amendments thereto, exists.
6 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult
7 may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only
8 the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency
9 guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for not more than
10 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions
11 for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (a) continue.
12 (c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an
13 emergency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to
14 represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided
15 in subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a
16 hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the respondent's
17 attorney and any other person the court determines.
18 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult
19 without notice to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the court
20 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physical health,
21 safety or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice
22 on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency
23 guardian without giving notice under subsection (c), the court must:
24 (1) Give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
25 appointment to:
26 (A) The respondent;
27 (B) the respondent's attorney; and
28 (C) any other person the court determines; and
29 (2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later
30 than five days after the appointment.
31 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a
32 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under
33 section 64, and amendments thereto.
34 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
35 this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the
36 court requires.
37 New Sec. 76. (a) A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary. A guardian
38 shall strive to assure that the personal, civil and human rights of the
39 individual subject to guardianship are protected. Except as otherwise
40 limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions regarding
41 the support, care, education, health and welfare of the adult subject to
42 guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's limitations and in
43 accordance with the guardian's plan under section 79, and amendments
HB 2359 49
1 thereto.
2 (b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the
3 adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, include the adult in decision
4 making, and encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act on the
5 adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the
6 adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
7 (1) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and
8 maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular
9 visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities
10 and physical and mental health;
11 (2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and
12 preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the
13 adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities or
14 social interactions; and
15 (3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive
16 relationships and services for the adult.
17 (c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care,
18 diligence and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for
19 the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
20 (1) Take reasonable care of the personal effects and service or support
21 animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or
22 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect
23 the adult's property;
24 (2) if authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
25 thereto, expend funds and other property of the adult received by the
26 guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health
27 and welfare;
28 (3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended
29 under paragraph (2) for the adult's future needs, but if a conservator has
30 been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other property at least
31 quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the adult's future needs;
32 and
33 (4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services,
34 provided to the adult.
35 (d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
36 guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the
37 adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would
38 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
39 interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to
40 guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's
41 previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, cultural practices,
42 religious beliefs, values and actions, to the extent actually known or
43 reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
HB 2359 50
1 (e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under subsection
2 (d) because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine
3 the decision the adult probably would make if able, or the guardian
4 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
5 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
6 interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best
7 interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the adult, the
8 guardian shall consider:
9 (1) Information received from professionals and persons that
10 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;
11 (2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have
12 considered if the adult were able to act; and
13 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult
14 would consider, including consequences for others.
15 (f) A guardian for an adult shall notify the court immediately if the
16 condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising
17 rights previously removed.
18 New Sec. 77. (a) Except as limited by court order, a guardian for an
19 adult may:
20 (1) If authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
21 thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
22 adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application or
23 receipt is within the powers of the conservator;
24 (2) establish the adult's place of dwelling;
25 (3) consent to health, including mental health, or other care, treatment
26 or service for the adult;
27 (4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed, commence a
28 proceeding including an administrative proceeding, or take other
29 appropriate action to compel another person to support the adult or pay
30 funds for the adult's benefit; and
31 (5) receive personally identifiable healthcare information regarding
32 the adult.
33 (b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
34 to consent to the adoption of the adult.
35 (c) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
36 to litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce, dissolution or
37 annulment of marriage of the individual subject to guardianship, including
38 negotiation of a settlement thereof.
39 (d) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (b)
40 or (c), the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in
41 accordance with the adult's preferences, values and prior directions and
42 whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.
43 (e) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(2) to
HB 2359 51
1 establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:
2 (1) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would
3 select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making
4 standard in section 76(d) and (e), and amendments thereto. If the guardian
5 does not know and cannot reasonably determine what setting the adult
6 subject to guardianship probably would choose if able, or the guardian
7 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
8 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
9 interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance with section
10 76(e), and amendments thereto, a residential setting that is consistent with
11 the adult's best interest;
12 (2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a
13 residential setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with
14 persons important to the adult and meet the adult's needs in the least
15 restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
16 inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 76(d) and (e),
17 and amendments thereto;
18 (3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the adult:
19 (A) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult and any person
20 identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing the
21 guardian or a subsequent order; and
22 (B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new dwelling
23 and state whether the adult received advance notice of the change and
24 whether the adult objected to the change;
25 (4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult to
26 a nursing home, mental health facility or other facility that places
27 restrictions on the adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
28 (A) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under section
29 79, and amendments thereto;
30 (B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or
31 (C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at least 14
32 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons entitled
33 to notice under section 73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent
34 order, and no objection is filed;
35 (5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside this
36 state only if consistent with the guardian's plan and authorized by the court
37 by specific order; and
38 (6) take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the lease
39 to the primary dwelling of the adult only if:
40 (A) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan under
41 section 79, and amendments thereto;
42 (B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or
43 (C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the action to
HB 2359 52
1 the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under section 73(e)(2), and
2 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order and no objection has been
3 filed.
4 (f) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(3) to make
5 healthcare decisions, the guardian shall:
6 (1) Involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably
7 feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting the
8 adult in understanding the risks and benefits of healthcare options;
9 (2) act in accordance with any declaration of the adult made pursuant
10 to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109, and amendments
11 thereto; and
12 (3) take into account:
13 (A) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
14 (B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult, if known
15 or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
16 New Sec. 78. (a) A guardian for an adult may not initiate the
17 commitment of the adult to a mental health facility except in accordance
18 with the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons, K.S.A. 59-2945 et
19 seq., and amendments thereto.
20 (b) A guardian for an adult may not restrict the ability of the adult to
21 communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving visitors and
22 making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or electronic
23 communications, including through social media, or participating in social
24 activities, unless:
25 (1) Authorized by the court by specific order;
26 (2) a protective order or a protective arrangement instead of
27 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
28 or
29 (3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
30 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
31 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult and the restriction is:
32 (A) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
33 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
34 (B) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
35 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult.
36 (c) A guardian for an adult may not consent, on behalf of the adult, to:
37 (1) Any psychosurgery, removal of any bodily organ or amputation of
38 any limb, unless such surgery, removal or amputation has been approved
39 in advance by the court, except in an emergency and when necessary to
40 preserve the life of the adult or to prevent serious and irreparable
41 impairment to the physical health of the adult;
42 (2) the sterilization of the adult, unless approved by the court
43 following a due process hearing held for the purposes of determining
HB 2359 53
1 whether to approve such, and during which hearing the adult is represented
2 by an attorney appointed by the court;
3 (3) the performance of any experimental biomedical or behavioral
4 procedure on the adult, or for the adult to be a participant in any
5 biomedical or behavioral experiment, without the prior review and
6 approval of such by either an institutional review board as provided for in
7 title 45, part 46 of the code of federal regulations, or if such regulations do
8 not apply, then by a review committee established by the agency,
9 institution or treatment facility at which the procedure or experiment is
10 proposed to occur, composed of members selected for the purposes of
11 determining whether the proposed procedure or experiment:
12 (A) Does not involve any significant risk of harm to the physical or
13 mental health of the adult, or the use of aversive stimulants, and is
14 intended to preserve the life or health of the adult or to assist the adult to
15 develop or regain skills or abilities; or
16 (B) involves a significant risk of harm to the physical or mental
17 health of the adult, or the use of an aversive stimulant, but that the
18 conducting of the proposed procedure or experiment is intended either to
19 preserve the life of the adult, or to significantly improve the quality of life
20 of the adult, or to assist the adult to develop or regain significant skills or
21 abilities, and that the guardian has been fully informed concerning the
22 potential risks and benefits of the proposed procedure or experiment or of
23 any aversive stimulant proposed to be used, and as to how and under what
24 circumstances the aversive stimulant may be used, and has specifically
25 consented to such;
26 (4) the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-sustaining
27 medical care, treatment, services or procedures, except:
28 (A) In accordance with the provisions of any declaration of the adult
29 made pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109,
30 and amendments thereto; or
31 (B) if the adult, prior to the court's appointment of a guardian, has
32 executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions pursuant to
33 K.S.A. 58-625, et seq., and amendments thereto, and that durable power of
34 attorney has not previously been revoked by the adult, and it includes any
35 provision relevant to the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
36 sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures, then the
37 guardian shall have the authority to act as provided for in that power of
38 attorney, even if the guardian has revoked or amended that power of
39 attorney pursuant to the authority of K.S.A. 58-627, and amendments
40 thereto; or
41 (C) in the circumstances where the adult's treating physician certifies
42 in writing to the guardian that the adult is in a persistent vegetative state or
43 is suffering from an illness or other medical condition for which further
HB 2359 54
1 treatment, other than for the relief of pain, would not likely prolong the life
2 of the adult other than by artificial means, nor would be likely to restore to
3 the adult any significant degree of capabilities beyond those the adult
4 currently possesses, and which opinion is concurred in by either a second
5 physician or by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the
6 healthcare provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing
7 such circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
8 order which would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
9 saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures.
10 The court shall review the written certification within 72 hours at a due
11 process hearing during which the adult is represented by an attorney
12 appointed by the court. The court may request that the state protection and
13 advocacy agency as provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or K.S.A. 74-
14 5515(a)(2)(A) and (B), and amendments thereto, or 42 U.S.C. 15043, 42
15 U.S.C. 10805 or 29 U.S.C. 794e represent the adult. Upon completion of
16 the hearing, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the

21 (d) A guardian for an adult may not exercise any control or authority
22 over the adult's estate, unless specifically authorized by the court. Any
23 guardian who is granted such authority must prepare an inventory and
24 provide notice of the inventory as provided in section 104, and
25 amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to the guardian

29 to guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
30 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and

41 duties and powers under sections 76 and 77, and amendments thereto. The
42 court shall review an initial guardian's plan at the review hearing
43 scheduled under section 73(b), and amendments thereto. When reviewing

11 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve.
12 (c) A guardian for an adult shall file a special report with the court

42 (2) the guardianship should continue; and
43 (3) the guardian's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
HB 2359 58
1 (g) If the court determines that there is reason to believe a guardian

25 guardian for an adult and appoint a successor guardian on:
26 (1) Petition of the adult, guardian or person interested in the welfare
27 of the adult, which contains allegations that, if true, would support a
28 reasonable belief that removal of the guardian and appointment of a

30 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
31 filed during the preceding six months;

15 termination would be in the best interest of the adult or for other good
16 cause; or
17 (2) modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of
18 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause.
19 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
20 or modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on:
21 (1) Petition under subsection (a) which contains allegations that, if

23 the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a
24 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
25 filed during the preceding six months;
26 (2) communication from the adult, guardian or person interested in

35 restrictive alternative for meeting the adult's needs is available; or
36 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
37 interest of the adult.
38 (c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or of a hearing under

8 follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the adult which
9 apply to a petition for guardianship.
10 (g) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or
11 modify the terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to

30 (2) the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at
31 unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age; or

34 of the minor.

11 (c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated

13 will encourage development of the adult's maximum self-determination
14 and independence. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a
15 limited conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conservatorship
16 or other less restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the adult.

HB 2359 64
1 persons required to be listed in the petition under section 84(b)(1) through
2 (3), and amendments thereto, and any other person interested in the
3 respondent's welfare the court determines. Failure to give notice under this
4 subsection does not preclude the court from appointing a conservator.

6 petition for any other order under sections 83 through 118, and
7 amendments thereto, together with a copy of the petition, must be given to:

24 adult, the court may appoint a court liaison. The duties and reporting
25 requirements of the court liaison are limited to the relief requested in the

33 the proceeding, including the potential loss of rights as a result of the
34 proceeding; and
35 (B) obtain the respondent's views about the appointment sought by
36 the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the
37 conservator's proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of
38 the proposed conservatorship.

40 substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to inform
41 the respondent of the respondent's rights and the nature and purpose of the
42 proceeding.

31 available by the court to counsel for all parties.
32 (d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation as
33 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
34 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this
35 section and that no further examination or evaluation should be required,
36 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an

8 alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent
9 to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.

15 of failing to do so;
16 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and

22 amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing,
23 assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of

25 in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court
26 shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
27 (d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
28 respondent at a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto.

HB 2359 69
1 person's participation.

20 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection (a),
21 the court shall select as conservator the person the court considers best
22 qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider
23 the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's skills, the
24 expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the person and the

28 decline to appoint as conservator a person having priority under subsection
29 (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.

1 New Sec. 95. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
2 section 84, and amendments thereto, or on a verified petition by a person
3 interested in an individual's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
4 conservator for the individual if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
5 establish probable cause that:
6 (1) Appointment of an emergency conservator is necessary to prevent
7 imminent, substantial and irreparable harm to the individual's property or
8 financial interests;
9 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
10 circumstances; and
11 (3) a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and

14 exceed 30 days and the emergency conservator may exercise only the
15 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency conservator's

29 hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints
30 an emergency conservator without giving notice under subsection (c), the
31 court must give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the

20 an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on faithful
21 discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive the
22 requirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-protection
23 arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the individual
24 subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),
25 the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is in the
26 business of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the conservator's
27 service.
28 (b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this
29 section must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the

41 under section 97, and amendments thereto:
42 (1) Except as otherwise provided by the bond, the surety and the

1 (2) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety
2 submits to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office
3 to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the conservator
4 in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the proceeding must be
5 given to the surety at the address shown in the records of the court in
6 which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety then known to
7 the person required to provide the notice.

23 prudence, loyalty, reasonable care and diligence to the individual subject to
24 conservatorship.
25 (b) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the
26 individual subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible, encourage
27 the individual to participate in decisions, act on the individual's own
28 behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the individual's
29 personal affairs. A conservator shall strive to assure that the personal, civil
30 and human rights of the individual subject to conservatorship are
31 protected.
32 (c) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship,
33 the conservator shall make the decision that the conservator reasonably
34 believes the individual would make if able, unless doing so would fail to
35 preserve the resources needed to maintain the individual's well-being and
36 lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or
37 personal or financial interests of the individual. To determine the decision
38 the individual would make if able, the conservator shall consider the
39 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values and
40 actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the
41 conservator.
42 (d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (c)
43 because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably determine
HB 2359 76
1 the decision the individual subject to conservatorship probably would
2 make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the decision the
3 individual would make would fail to preserve resources needed to
4 maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise
5 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial

10 conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the
11 individual.

13 the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided by the
14 revised uniform fiduciary access to digital assets act or court order.

5 individual's qualification for such benefits, whether or not the trust extends
6 beyond the duration of the conservatorship;

30 subject to conservatorship would make if able, the court shall consider the
31 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values and
32 actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the
33 conservator. The court shall also consider:
34 (1) The financial needs of the individual subject to conservatorship

36 conservatorship for support, and the interests of creditors of the individual;
37 (2) possible reduction of income, estate, inheritance or other tax

HB 2359 82
1 conservatorship will terminate before the individual's death; and
2 (7) any other relevant factor.
3 New Sec. 103. (a) Not later than 60 days after appointment, and
4 whenever there is a significant change in circumstances or the conservator
5 seeks to deviate significantly from the existing conservator's plan, a
6 conservator shall file with the court a plan for protecting, managing,
7 expending and distributing the assets of the conservatorship estate. The
8 plan must be based on the needs of the individual subject to
9 conservatorship and take into account the best interest of the individual as
10 well as the individual's preferences, values and prior directions, to the
11 extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The
12 conservator shall include in the plan:
13 (1) A budget containing projected expenses and resources, including

29 the right to object to the plan and must be given at the time of the filing.
30 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled
31 under subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the conservator's plan
32 may object to the plan in writing not later than 21 days after the filing.
33 (d) The court shall review the conservator's plan filed under
34 subsection (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new
35 plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an
36 objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is consistent with the
37 conservator's duties and powers. The court shall review an initial
38 conservator's plan at the review hearing scheduled under section 93(e), and
39 amendments thereto. For subsequent conservator's plans, the court has
40 discretion whether to set the matter for hearing but may not approve the
41 plan until 30 days after the filing.
42 (e) After a conservator's plan under this section is approved by the
43 court, the conservator shall provide a copy of the plan to the individual
HB 2359 83
1 subject to conservatorship, any attorney representing the individual subject
2 to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
3 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
4 determines.

6 conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing court a detailed

10 and assets of the conservatorship estate, including any sources of regular
11 income to the estate, and information about how property is titled and any
12 beneficiary designations, including pay-on-death and transfer-on-death
13 beneficiaries.
14 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the
15 individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under
16 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any
17 other person the court determines. The notice must be given not later than
18 14 days after the filing.
19 (c) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the
20 conservatorship estate and make them available for examination on
21 reasonable request of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian
22 for the individual, or any other person the conservator or the court
23 determines.
24 New Sec. 105. (a) A conservator shall file with the court a report in a
25 record regarding the administration of the conservatorship estate annually
26 unless the court otherwise directs, on resignation or removal, on
27 termination of the conservatorship, and at any other time the court directs.
28 (b) A report under subsection (a) must state or contain:

43 redacted;
HB 2359 84
1 (6) anything of more than de minimis value which the conservator,
2 any individual who resides with the conservator, or the spouse, parent,
3 child or sibling of the conservator has received from a person providing
4 goods or services to the individual subject to conservatorship;
5 (7) any business relation the conservator has with a person the
6 conservator has paid or that has benefited from the property of the
7 individual subject to conservatorship;
8 (8) whether any co-conservator or successor conservator appointed to
9 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve; and
10 (9) a copy of the bond renewal.
11 (c) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report under this
12 section or conservator's plan under section 103, and amendments thereto,
13 interview the individual subject to conservatorship or conservator, or
14 investigate any other matter involving the conservatorship. In connection
15 with the report, the court may order the conservator to submit the
16 conservatorship estate to appropriate examination in a manner the court
17 directs.
18 (d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report,
19 together with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual
20 subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f),
21 and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and other persons the
22 court determines. The notice and report must be given not later than 14
23 days after filing.
24 (e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
25 submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to
26 determine whether:
27 (1) The reports provide sufficient information to establish the
28 conservator has complied with the conservator's duties;
29 (2) the conservatorship should continue; and
30 (3) the conservator's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
31 (f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator has
32 not complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship should
33 not continue, the court:
34 (1) Shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the
35 conservator and any other person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
36 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order;
37 (2) may require additional information from the conservator;
38 (3) may appoint a court liaison to interview the individual subject to
39 conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving the
40 conservatorship; and
41 (4) consistent with sections 112 and 113, and amendments thereto,
42 may hold a hearing to consider removal of the conservator, termination of
43 the conservatorship or a change in the powers granted to the conservator or
HB 2359 85
1 terms of the conservatorship.
2 (g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a conservator
3 are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to
4 adjust the requested fees.
5 (h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report filed
6 under this section. The court after review may approve the report. If the
7 court approves the report, there is a rebuttable presumption the report is
8 accurate as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
9 (i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report of a
10 conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities concerning a
11 matter adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person given notice of the
12 report or accounting.
13 (j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report filed
14 under this section discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims
15 and causes of action by a person given notice of the report and the hearing
16 as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
17 New Sec. 106. (a) The interest of an individual subject to
18 conservatorship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not
19 transferrable or assignable by the individual and is not subject to levy,
20 garnishment, or similar process for claims against the individual unless
21 allowed under section 110, and amendments thereto.
22 (b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract
23 after having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the
24 contract is void against the individual and the individual's property but is
25 enforceable against the person that contracted with the individual.
26 (c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual
27 subject to conservatorship with respect to property included in the
28 conservatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of this state
29 other than this act.
30 New Sec. 107. A transaction involving a conservatorship estate which
31 is affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's fiduciary
32 duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction is
33 authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under
34 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order. A
35 transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale, encumbrance
36 or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate entered into by
37 the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the
38 spouse, descendant, sibling, agent or attorney of the conservator, or a
39 corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial
40 beneficial interest.
41 New Sec. 108. (a) A person that assists or deals with a conservator in
42 good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction
43 requiring a court order under section 102, and amendments thereto, is
HB 2359 86
1 protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in
2 question. Knowledge alone by a person that the person is dealing with a
3 conservator does not require the person to inquire into the existence of
4 authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's exercise
5 of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of office, or
6 otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that
7 pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper
8 application of the property.
9 (b) Protection under subsection (a) extends to a procedural
10 irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the
11 issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a
12 person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable
13 provisions in law of this state other than this act relating to a commercial
14 transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.
15 New Sec. 109. (a) If an individual subject to conservatorship dies, the
16 conservator shall deliver to the district court any will of the individual that
17 is in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representative
18 named in the will if feasible. The conservator shall give notice of the
19 delivery of the will under this section to any person entitled to notice under
20 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
21 (b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
22 conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate
23 as provided in section 113, and amendments thereto.
24 New Sec. 110. (a) A conservator may pay a claim against the
25 conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising
26 before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in
27 accordance with the priorities under subsection (d). A claimant may
28 present a claim by:
29 (1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of
30 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and
31 the amount claimed; or
32 (2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court,
33 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
34 (b) A claim under subsection (a) is presented on receipt by the
35 conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the
36 claim, whichever occurs first. A presented claim is allowed, if it is not
37 disallowed in whole or in part, by the conservator in a record sent or
38 delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation.
39 Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to
40 a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court
41 order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls
42 until 30 days after disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of
43 limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.
HB 2359 87
1 (c) A claimant whose claim under subsection (a) has not been paid
2 may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred
3 by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment
4 or security by encumbering property included in the conservatorship
5 estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to
6 conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is
7 initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of
8 the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the
9 conservatorship estate.
10 (d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all
11 existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in

13 (1) Costs and expenses of administration;
14 (2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority under
15 law other than this act;

20 (4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and
21 (5) all other claims.
22 (e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under
23 subsection (d) over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
24 payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
25 (1) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without
26 sufficient funds to pay the basic living and healthcare expenses of the
27 individual subject to conservatorship; and
28 (2) the court authorizes the preference under section 102(a)(8), and
29 amendments thereto.
30 (f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all
31 existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual
32 subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security
33 interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future
34 date.
35 New Sec. 111. (a) Except as otherwise agreed by a conservator, the
36 conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in a
37 fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the conservatorship
38 estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's representative
39 capacity in the contract or before entering into the contract.
40 (b) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from
41 control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission
42 occurring in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate only
43 if the conservator is personally at fault.
HB 2359 88
1 (c) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a
2 fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included
3 in the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of
4 administration of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against the
5 conservatorship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a
6 fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable for
7 the claim.
8 (d) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the
9 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting,
10 surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action.
11 New Sec. 112. (a) The court may remove a conservator for failure to
12 perform the conservator's duties or other good cause and appoint a
13 successor conservator to assume the duties of the conservator.
14 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a
15 conservator and appoint a successor on:
16 (1) Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator
17 or person interested in the welfare of the individual which contains
18 allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that removal of
19 the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appropriate, but
20 the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or
21 substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding six months;
22 (2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
23 conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
24 supports a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and
25 appointment of a successor may be appropriate;
26 (3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
27 interest of the individual subject to conservatorship; or
28 (4) determination by the court that the conservator's reports and
29 accountings are delinquent or deficient as filed.
30 (c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or any hearing under
31 this section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the
32 conservator, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
33 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
34 determines.
35 (d) If the individual subject to conservatorship is not represented by
36 an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions
37 as in section 88, and amendments thereto. The court shall award
38 reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in section 42, and
39 amendments thereto.
40 (e) In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the
41 priorities under section 92, and amendments thereto.
42 (f) Not later than 30 days after appointing a successor conservator,
43 the court or court's designee shall give notice of the appointment to the

1 individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice
2 under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.

12 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a
13 person interested in the welfare of the individual may petition for:

16 termination would be in the best interest of the individual or for other good
17 cause; or
18 (2) modification of the conservatorship on the ground that the extent
19 of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
20 cause.
21 (d) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
22 or modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on:
23 (1) Petition under subsection (c) which contains allegations that, if
24 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of
25 the conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold
26 a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
27 filed within the preceding six months;
28 (2) a communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
29 conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
30 supports a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the
31 conservatorship may be appropriate, including because the functional
32 needs of the individual or supports or services available to the individual
33 have changed;
34 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
35 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
36 needs or supports or services available to the individual have changed or a
37 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
38 alternative is available; or
39 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
40 interest of the individual.
41 (e) Notice of a petition under subsection (c) or of a hearing under this

3 (f) After the hearing, the court shall order termination unless it is
4 proven that a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and
5 amendments thereto, continues to exist.
6 (g) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the
7 powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities or
8 limitations of the individual subject to conservatorship, the individual's
9 supports or other circumstances.
10 (h) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before
11 terminating a conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures
12 to safeguard the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship which
13 apply to a petition for conservatorship.
14 (i) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to terminate or
15 modify the terms of the conservatorship has the right to retain an attorney
16 to represent the individual in this matter. If the individual is not

41 New Sec. 114. (a) A conservatorship for a minor may be extended
42 beyond the minor's 18th birthday if the minor consents or the court finds by
43 clear and convincing evidence that substantial harm to the minor's interests
HB 2359 91
1 is otherwise likely. A conservatorship may be extended under this section
2 until the minor reaches the age of 21 and may be extended for two
3 additional two-year periods upon the same finding by the court or upon
4 consent of the minor. Consent to the extension of a conservatorship may be
5 withdrawn at any time.
6 (b) Any request to extend a minor conservatorship under this section

9 conservator proposes to distribute to the minor over an extended period
10 following the minor's 18th birthday;
11 (2) the factual basis upon which the conservator alleges the need for

19 distribution plan if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
20 (1) Substantial harm to the minor's interests is likely if the
21 conservatorship is not extended; and
22 (2) the plan approved by the court adequately provides for meeting
23 the expected needs of the minor from the minor's 18th birthday until the
24 final distribution of the funds or assets which the court authorizes to be set
25 aside or transferred from the estate are paid over to the minor, including
26 provisions for accelerated distribution in extraordinary circumstances,
27 which may require court approval.
28 (e) If the court orders a conservatorship for a minor to be extended

41 extended distribution until such is actually paid to the minor.

6 (2) a guardian for the minor;
7 (3) a custodian under the uniform transfers to minors act; or

11 (b) A person that transfers funds or other property under this section
12 is not responsible for its proper application.
13 (c) A person that receives funds or other property for a minor under

27 appointed for the minor.
28 New Sec. 117. (a) Any court having either control over or possession
29 of any amount of money not exceeding $100,000, the right to which is

32 the authority of a parent as provided for in section 116, and amendments
33 thereto, the deposit of the money in a savings account of a bank, credit
34 union, savings and loan association or any other investment account that
35 the court may authorize, payable either to a conservator, if one shall be
36 appointed for the minor, or to the minor upon attaining 18 years of age.
37 (b) Any court having either control over or possession of any amount
38 of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested in a minor,
39 shall have the discretion to order the payment of the money to any person,
40 including the parent of the minor, or the minor. If the person is the
41 conservator for the minor, the court may waive or recommend the waiver
42 of the requirement of a bond. If the person is anyone other than the minor,
43 the court shall order that person to hold in trust and manage the minor's
HB 2359 93
1 estate for the minor's benefit.
2 New Sec. 118. Any court having either control over or possession of
3 any amount of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested

20 and amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of

35 arrangement instead of guardianship if the court finds by clear and
36 convincing evidence that:
37 (1) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for
38 physical health, safety or self-care because the respondent is unable to
39 receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even
40 with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported

42 (2) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a less

24 (c) for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for the adult if

43 amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of
HB 2359 95
1 conservatorship for a minor, the court may issue an order under subsection
2 (c) for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for the
3 respondent if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
4 arrangement is in the minor's best interest, and:

11 attorney is under a duty to act in the interest of the principal and to avoid
12 conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact so to act.
13 A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power of attorney
14 who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the power of
15 attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers conferred in the
16 best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing and conflicts of
17 interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the trustee's beneficiary
18 or beneficiaries. The attorney in fact shall keep a record of receipts,
19 disbursements and transactions made on behalf of the principal and shall
20 not comingle funds or assets of the principal with the funds or assets of the
21 attorney in fact. In the absence of explicit authorization, the attorney in
22 fact shall exercise a high degree of care in maintaining, without
23 modification, any estate plan which the principal may have in place,
24 including, but not limited to, arrangements made by the principal for
25 disposition of assets at death through beneficiary designations, ownership
26 by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, trust arrangements or by will or
27 codicil. Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney or in a separate
28 agreement between the principal and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact
29 who elects to act shall exercise the authority granted in a power of attorney
30 with that degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person

34 24a01 et seq., and amendments thereto. If the attorney in fact has special

37 in the principal's behalf.
38 (b) On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's
39 behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, an
40 attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the principal, to
41 communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow the instructions
42 of the principal.
43 (c) If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court of
HB 2359 118
1 the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, guardian of the estate or
2 other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's
3 property or all of the principal's property except specified exclusions, the
4 attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal.
5 The fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the durable power of
6 attorney that the principal would have had if the principal were not an
7 adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or conservator or both as
8 defined by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 59-3051 section 25, and amendments
9 thereto.

12 a guardian or conservator, or both, is filed, the court shall make the
13 appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination in
14 the power of attorney, so long as the individual nominated is a fit and
15 proper person.
16 (e) An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the
17 principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of
18 attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the principal's
19 legal representative or a court, and the oral and written instructions of the
20 principal, or the written instructions of the principal's legal representative
21 or a court.

37 subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact is
38 otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the principal, this
39 section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact that would
40 conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.
41 Sec. 145. K.S.A. 58-662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 58-
42 662. (a) The principal may petition the court for an accounting by the

1 fact. If the principal is disabled or deceased, a petition for accounting may
2 be filed by the principal's legal representative, an adult member of the
3 principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the principal.
4 (b) Any requirement for an accounting may be waived or an
5 accounting may be approved by the court without hearing, if the
6 accounting is waived or approved by a principal who is not disabled, or by
7 a principal whose legal capacity has been restored, or by all creditors and
8 distributees of a deceased principal's estate whose claims or distributions
9 theretofore have not been satisfied in full. The approval or waiver shall be
10 in writing, signed by the affected persons and filed with the court.
11 (c) For the purposes of subsection (b), a legal representative or a
12 person providing services to the principal's estate shall not be considered a
13 creditor of the principal's estate. No express approval or waiver shall be
14 required from the legal representative of a disabled principal if the
15 principal's legal capacity has been restored, or from the personal
16 representative of a deceased principal's estate, or from any other person
17 entitled to compensation or expense for services rendered to a disabled or
18 deceased principal's estate, unless the principal or the principal's estate is
19 unable to pay in full the compensation and expense to which the person
20 rendering the services may be entitled.
21 (d) The principal, the principal's attorney in fact, an adult member of
22 the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
23 principal may petition the district court in the county where the principal is
24 then residing to determine and declare whether a principal, who has
25 executed a power of attorney, is a disabled person.
26 (e) If the principal is a disabled person, on petition of the principal's
27 legal representative, an adult member of the principal's family or any
28 interested person, including a person interested in the welfare of the
29 principal, for good cause shown, the court may:
30 (1) Order the attorney in fact to exercise or refrain from exercising
31 authority in a durable power of attorney in a particular manner or for a
32 particular purpose;
33 (2) modify the authority of an attorney in fact under a durable power
34 of attorney;
35 (3) declare suspended a power of attorney that is nondurable;
36 (4) terminate a durable power of attorney;
37 (5) remove the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;

39 in fact to act under a durable power of attorney; and

42 for the principal pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050, et seq. the Kansas uniform
43 guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements act,
HB 2359 120
1 sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto.
2 (f) In addition to any other remedies available under law, if after
3 notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a showing that
4 the principal is a disabled person and that the attorney in fact has breached
5 such attorney in fact's fiduciary duty to the principal or that there is a
6 reasonable likelihood that such attorney in fact may do so in the immediate
7 future, the court, in its discretion, may issue an order that some or all of
8 the authority granted by the durable power of attorney be suspended or
9 modified, and that a different attorney in fact be authorized to exercise
10 some or all of the powers granted by the durable power of attorney. Such
11 attorney in fact may be designated by the court. The court may require any
12 person petitioning for any such order to file a bond in such amount and
13 with such sureties as required by the court to indemnify either the attorney
14 in fact who has been acting on behalf of the principal or the principal and
15 the principal's successors in interest for the expenses, including attorney
16 fees, incurred by any such persons with respect to such proceeding. The
17 court, after hearing, may allow payment or enter judgment. None of the
18 actions described in this subsection shall be taken by the court until after
19 hearing upon reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified
20 statement supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action
21 identifying the immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons
22 known to the petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal.
23 Except that in the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the
24 court, without notice, may enter such temporary order as seems proper to
25 the court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than 30
26 days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to the
27 persons identified as herein provided in this subsection.
28 (g) If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court or
29 the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an
30 accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property
31 belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the
32 attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a
33 successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.
34 (h) In a proceeding under this act or in any other proceeding, or upon
35 petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:
36 (1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a power of attorney to
37 account;
38 (2) authorize the attorney in fact under a power of attorney to enter
39 into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any
40 transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is, was
41 or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power to
42 authorize for a conservator pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050 et seq. the Kansas
43 uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements
HB 2359 121
1 act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto; and
2 (3) relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise authority
3 for a disabled principal under a durable power of attorney.
4 (i) Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation,
5 any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach of
6 duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has received
7 an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter unless a
8 proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within two years
9 after receipt of the account or statement by the principal or, if the principal
10 is a disabled person, by a guardian or conservator of the disabled person's
11 estate. If a disabled person has no guardian or conservator of the disabled
12 person's estate at the time an account or statement is presented, then the
13 cause of action shall not be barred until one year after the removal of the
14 principal's disability or incapacity, one year after the appointment of a
15 conservator for the principal or one year after the death of the principal.
16 The cause of action thus barred does not include any action to recover
17 from an attorney in fact or successor for fraud, misrepresentation or
18 concealment related to the settlement of any transaction involving the
19 agency relationship of the attorney in fact with the principal.

22 by any party if the proposed patient is absent such that further proceedings

14 brought in this state and this state was not the respondent's home state on

17 requested before or after the emergency appointment.
18 New Sec. 11. Except as otherwise provided in section 10, and

6 New Sec. 13. (a) If at any time a court of this state determines that it
7 acquired jurisdiction to appoint a guardian or issue a protective order
8 because of unjustifiable conduct, the court may:
9 (1) Decline to exercise jurisdiction;
10 (2) exercise jurisdiction for the limited purpose of fashioning an
11 appropriate remedy to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the
12 respondent or the protection of the respondent's property or prevent a
13 repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding
14 until a petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a
15 protective order is filed in a court of another state having jurisdiction; or
16 (3) continue to exercise jurisdiction after considering:
17 (A) The extent to which the respondent and all persons required to be
18 notified of the proceedings have acquiesced in the exercise of the court's
19 jurisdiction;
20 (B) whether it is a more appropriate forum than the court of any other
21 state under the factors set forth in section 12(c), and amendments thereto;
22 and
23 (C) whether the court of any other state would have jurisdiction under
24 factual circumstances in substantial conformity with the jurisdictional
25 standards of section 9, and amendments thereto.
26 (b) If a court of this state determines that it acquired jurisdiction to
27 appoint a guardian or issue a protective order because a party seeking to
28 invoke its jurisdiction engaged in unjustifiable conduct, it may assess
29 against that party necessary and reasonable expenses, including attorney
30 fees, investigative fees, court costs, communication expenses, witness fees
31 and expenses and travel expenses. The court may not assess fees, costs or
32 expenses of any kind against this state or a governmental subdivision,
33 agency or instrumentality of this state unless authorized by law other than
34 this act.
35 New Sec. 14. If a petition for the appointment of a guardian or
36 issuance of a protective order is brought in this state and this state was not
37 the respondent's home state on the date the petition was filed, in addition
38 to complying with the notice requirements of this state, notice of the
39 petition must be given to those persons who would be entitled to notice of
40 the petition if a proceeding were brought in the respondent's home state.
41 The notice must be given in the same manner as notice is required to be
42 given in this state.

HB 2359 7
1 in an emergency or issuance of a protective order limited to property
2 located in this state under section 10(a)(1) or (2), and amendments thereto,
3 if a petition for the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective
4 order is filed in this state and in another state and neither petition has been
5 dismissed or withdrawn, the following rules apply:
6 (a) If the court in this state has jurisdiction under section 9, and
7 amendments thereto, it may proceed with the case unless a court in another
8 state acquires jurisdiction under provisions similar to section 9, and
9 amendments thereto, before the appointment or issuance of the order.
10 (b) If the court in this state does not have jurisdiction under section 9,
11 and amendments thereto, whether at the time the petition is filed or at any
12 time before the appointment or issuance of the order, the court shall stay
13 the proceeding and communicate with the court in the other state. If the
14 court in the other state has jurisdiction, the court in this state shall dismiss
15 the petition unless the court in the other state determines that the court in
16 this state is a more appropriate forum.
17 New Sec. 16. (a) A guardian or conservator appointed in this state
18 may petition the court to transfer the guardianship or conservatorship to
19 another state.
20 (b) Notice of a petition under subsection (a) must be given to the

22 appointment of a guardian or conservator.
23 (c) On the court's own motion or on request of the guardian or
24 conservator, the incapacitated or protected person, or other person required
25 to be notified of the petition, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition
26 filed pursuant to subsection (a).
27 (d) The court shall issue an order provisionally granting a petition to
28 transfer a guardianship and shall direct the guardian to petition for
29 guardianship in the other state if the court is satisfied that the guardianship
30 will be accepted by the court in the other state and the court finds that:
31 (1) The incapacitated person is physically present in or is reasonably
32 expected to move permanently to the other state;
33 (2) an objection to the transfer has not been made or, if an objection
34 has been made, the objector has not established that the transfer would be
35 contrary to the interests of the incapacitated person; and
36 (3) plans for care and services for the incapacitated person in the
37 other state are reasonable and sufficient.
38 (e) The court shall issue a provisional order granting a petition to
39 transfer a conservatorship and shall direct the conservator to petition for
40 conservatorship in the other state if the court is satisfied that the
41 conservatorship will be accepted by the court of the other state and the
42 court finds that:
43 (1) The protected person is physically present in or is reasonably

HB 2359 8
1 expected to move permanently to the other state, or the protected person
2 has a significant connection to the other state considering the factors in
3 section 7(b), and amendments thereto;
4 (2) an objection to the transfer has not been made or, if an objection
5 has been made, the objector has not established that the transfer would be

8 protected person's property.
9 (f) The court shall issue a final order confirming the transfer and
10 terminating the guardianship or conservatorship upon its receipt of:
11 (1) A provisional order accepting the proceeding from the court to
12 which the proceeding is to be transferred which is issued under provisions
13 similar to section 17, and amendments thereto; and
14 (2) the documents required to terminate a guardianship or
15 conservatorship in this state.
16 New Sec. 17. (a) To confirm transfer of a guardianship or
17 conservatorship transferred to this state under provisions similar to section
18 16, and amendments thereto, the guardian or conservator must petition the
19 court in this state to accept the guardianship or conservatorship. The
20 petition must include a certified copy of the other state's provisional order
21 of transfer.
22 (b) Notice of a petition under subsection (a) must be given to those
23 persons that would be entitled to notice if the petition were a petition for
24 the appointment of a guardian or issuance of a protective order in both the
25 transferring state and this state. The notice must be given in the same
26 manner as notice is required to be given in this state.
27 (c) On the court's own motion or on request of the guardian or
28 conservator, the incapacitated or protected person, or other person required
29 to be notified of the proceeding, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition
30 filed pursuant to subsection (a).
31 (d) The court shall issue an order provisionally granting a petition

41 transferred of a final order issued under provisions similar to section 16,
42 and amendments thereto, transferring the proceeding to this state.
43 (f) Not later than 90 days after issuance of a final order accepting

HB 2359 9
1 transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship, the court shall determine
2 whether the guardianship or conservatorship needs to be modified to
3 conform to the law of this state.
4 (g) In granting a petition under this section, the court shall recognize
5 a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state, including the
6 determination of the incapacitated or protected person's incapacity and the
7 appointment of the guardian or conservator.
8 (h) The denial by a court of this state of a petition to accept a
9 guardianship or conservatorship transferred from another state does not
10 affect the ability of the guardian or conservator to seek appointment as
11 guardian or conservator in this state under sections 24 through 135, and
12 amendments thereto, if the court has jurisdiction to make an appointment
13 other than by reason of the provisional order of transfer.
14 New Sec. 18. If a guardian has been appointed in another state and a
15 petition for the appointment of a guardian is not pending in this state, the

19 of this state, certified copies of the order and letters of office.
20 New Sec. 19. If a conservator has been appointed in another state and

24 as a foreign judgment in a court of this state, in any county in which
25 property belonging to the protected person is located, certified copies of
26 the order and letters of office and of any bond.
27 New Sec. 20. (a) Upon registration of a guardianship or protective
28 order from another state, the guardian or conservator may exercise in this
29 state all powers authorized in the order of appointment except as

20 its county except that it may refuse to approve the same for payment only
21 on the grounds that the respondent or person under guardianship or
22 conservatorship is not a resident of that county. In such case it shall
23 transmit the statement of costs to the secretary of the department for
24 children and families who shall determine the question of residence and
25 certify those findings to each district court. If the claim for costs is not

16 objection to the standby guardian's assumption of duties and powers of a
17 guardian. The court shall hold a hearing if the objection supports a
18 reasonable belief that the conditions for assumption of duties and powers
19 have not been satisfied.
20 New Sec. 58. (a) On its own, or on verified petition by a person
21 interested in a minor's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
22 guardian for the minor if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
23 establish probable cause that:
24 (1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
25 imminent and substantial harm to the minor's health, safety or welfare; and
26 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
27 circumstances.
28 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for a minor
29 may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only
30 the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency
31 guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for not more than
32 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions
33 for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (a) continue.
34 (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), reasonable notice
35 of the date, time and place of a hearing on a petition for appointment of an
36 emergency guardian for a minor must be given to:

38 (2) any attorney appointed under section 54, and amendments thereto;
39 (3) each parent of the minor;
40 (4) any person, other than a parent, having care or custody of the

42 (5) any other person the court determines.
43 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for a minor

HB 2359 32
1 without notice under subsection (c) and without a hearing only if the court
2 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the minor's health, safety or
3 welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice on the
4 appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian
5 without notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a represented
6 minor, notice of the appointment must be given not later than 48 hours
7 after the appointment to the individuals listed in subsection (c). Not later
8 than seven days after the appointment, the court shall hold a hearing on the
9 appropriateness of the appointment.
10 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section, with or
11 without notice, is not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of
12 a guardian under section 51, and amendments thereto.
13 (f) The emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires.
14 (g) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
15 this section at any time.
16 New Sec. 59. (a) A guardian for a minor is a fiduciary. Except as
17 otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for a minor has the duties and
18 responsibilities of a parent regarding the minor's support, care, education,
19 health, safety and welfare. A guardian shall act in the minor's best interest
20 and exercise reasonable care, diligence and prudence.
21 (b) A guardian for a minor shall:
22 (1) Be personally acquainted with the minor and maintain sufficient
23 contact with the minor to know the minor's abilities, limitations, needs,
24 opportunities and physical and mental health;
25 (2) take reasonable care of the minor's personal effects and bring a
26 proceeding for a conservatorship, or protective arrangement instead of
27 conservatorship, if necessary to protect other property of the minor;
28 (3) if authorized by the court under section 61, and amendments
29 thereto, expend funds of the minor which have been received by the
30 guardian for the minor's current needs for support, care, education, health,
31 safety and welfare;
32 (4) conserve any funds of the minor not expended under paragraph
33 (3) for the minor's future needs, but if a conservator is appointed for the
34 minor, pay the funds at least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved
35 for the minor's future needs;
36 (5) report the condition of the minor and account for funds and other
37 property of the minor in the guardian's possession or subject to the
38 guardian's control, as required by court rule or ordered by the court on
39 application of a person interested in the minor's welfare;
40 (6) inform the court of any change in the minor's dwelling or address;
41 and

6 may:
7 (1) If authorized by the court under section 61, and amendments
8 thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits otherwise payable for the
9 support of the minor to the minor's parent, guardian or custodian under a
10 statutory system of benefits or insurance or any private contract, devise,
11 trust, conservatorship or custodianship;
12 (2) unless inconsistent with a court order entitled to recognition in
13 this state, take custody of the minor and establish the minor's place of
14 dwelling and, on authorization of the court, establish or move the minor's
15 dwelling outside this state;
16 (3) if the minor is not subject to conservatorship, commence a
17 proceeding, including an administrative proceeding, or take other
18 appropriate action to compel a person to support the minor or make a
19 payment for the benefit of the minor; and
20 (4) consent to health or other care, treatment or service for the minor.
21 (c) The court may authorize a guardian for a minor to consent to the

25 marriage.
26 New Sec. 61. A guardian for a minor may not exercise any control or
27 authority over the minor's estate, unless specifically authorized by the
28 court. Any guardian who is granted such authority must prepare an
29 inventory and provide notice of the inventory as provided in section 104,
30 and amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to the
31 guardian and may waive the requirement of the posting of a bond, only if:
32 (a) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by the
33 minor equals $25,000 or less;
34 (b) either the court requires the guardian to report to the court the
35 commencement of the exercising of such authority, or requires the
36 guardian to obtain court authorization to commence the exercise of such
37 authority, as the court shall specify; and
38 (c) the court also requires the guardian, whenever the combined value
39 of such funds and property exceeds $25,000, to:
40 (1) File a guardian's plan as provided for in section 63, and
41 amendments thereto, that contains elements similar to those that would be
42 contained in a conservator's plan as provided for in section 103, and
43 amendments thereto;

HB 2359 34
1 (2) petition the court for appointment of a conservator; or
2 (3) notify the court as the court shall specify that the value of the

4 appointed a conservator but did not issue letters of conservatorship
5 pending such notification.
6 New Sec. 62. (a) Guardianship under this act for a minor terminates:
7 (1) On the minor's death, adoption, emancipation or attainment of
8 majority; or
9 (2) when the court finds that the standard in section 51, and
10 amendments thereto, for appointment of a guardian is not satisfied, unless
11 the court finds that:
12 (A) Termination of the guardianship would be harmful to the minor;
13 and
14 (B) the minor's interest in the continuation of the guardianship
15 outweighs the interest of any parent of the minor in restoration of the
16 parent's right to make decisions for the minor.
17 (b) A minor subject to guardianship or a person interested in the
18 welfare of the minor may petition the court to terminate the guardianship,
19 modify the guardianship, remove the guardian and appoint a successor
20 guardian or remove a standby guardian and appoint a different standby
21 guardian.
22 (c) A petitioner under subsection (b) shall give notice of the hearing

25 person the court determines.
26 (d) The court shall follow the priorities in section 56(b), and
27 amendments thereto, when selecting a successor guardian for a minor.
28 (e) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a successor guardian
29 for a minor, the court shall give notice of the appointment to the minor
30 subject to guardianship, if the minor is 12 years of age or older, each
31 parent of the minor and any other person the court determines.
32 (f) When terminating a guardianship for a minor under this section,
33 the court may issue an order providing for transitional arrangements that
34 will assist the minor with a transition of custody and is in the best interest
35 of the minor.
36 (g) A removed guardian for a minor shall cooperate with a successor
37 guardian to facilitate transition of the guardian's responsibilities and
38 protect the best interest of the minor.
39 (h) Not later than 30 days after entering an order under this section,
40 the court or the court's designee shall give notice of the order to the minor
41 subject to guardianship and any person entitled to notice under section 56,
42 and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
43 New Sec. 63. (a) At any time, the court may require the guardian of a

HB 2359 35
1 minor, or the guardian of a minor may choose, to develop and file with the
2 court a plan of care for the minor. Any such plan must be based on the
3 needs of the minor and take into account the best interest of the minor as
4 well as the minor's preferences, to the extent known to or reasonably

19 concerning the care or custody of the minor identified in the petition, each
20 parent of the minor, a person entitled to notice under section 56(d), and
21 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
22 determines. The notice shall include a statement of the right to object to
23 the plan and shall be given at the time of the filing.
24 (c) The minor, a parent of the minor and any person entitled under
25 subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the guardian's plan may
26 object to the plan in writing not later than 21 days after the filing.
27 (d) The court shall review the guardian's plan filed under subsection
28 (a) and determine whether to approve the plan, modify the plan or require
29 a new plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall
30 consider an objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is
31 consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under sections 59 and 60,
32 and amendments thereto. The court may not approve the plan until 30 days
33 after the filing.
34 (e) After the guardian's plan filed under this section is approved by
35 the court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the minor if the

39 minor, to any person entitled to notice under section 56(d), and
40 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
41 determines.
42 New Sec. 64. (a) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court
43 may:

HB 2359 36
1 (1) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and
2 convincing evidence that:
3 (A) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements
4 for physical health, safety or self-care because the respondent is unable to
5 receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even
6 with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported
7 decision making; and
8 (B) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective
9 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative; or
10 (2) with appropriate findings, treat the petition as one for a
11 conservatorship under sections 83 through 118, and amendments thereto,
12 or a protective arrangement under sections 119 through 130, and
13 amendments thereto, issue any appropriate order or dismiss the
14 proceeding.
15 (b) The court shall grant a guardian appointed under subsection (a)
16 only those powers necessitated by the demonstrated needs and limitations
17 of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage development of the
18 respondent's maximum self-determination and independence. The court
19 may not establish a full guardianship if a limited guardianship, protective
20 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternatives
21 would meet the needs of the respondent.

23 the adult for whom the order is sought, may file a verified petition for

31 guardianship program;
32 (5) the reason a guardianship is necessary, including a description of:

17 conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
18 mental health center, community developmental disability organization or
19 by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant,

21 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and

14 available by the court to counsel for all parties.
15 (d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation as
16 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
17 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this
18 section and that no further examination or evaluation should be required,
19 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an
20 examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be filed with
21 the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at least four days
22 prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request shall be a statement
23 of the reasons why an examination and evaluation is requested and the
24 name and address of a qualified professional or facility willing and able to

26 examination and evaluation, the court may continue the trial and fix a new
27 date, time and place of the trial at a time not to exceed 30 days from the
28 date of the filing of the request.
29 New Sec. 70. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
30 hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may not proceed unless
31 the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the
32 respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings typically
33 are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the hearing at an
34 alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent
35 to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.
36 (b) A hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may
37 proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
38 and convincing evidence that:
39 (1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after having
40 been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences
41 of failing to do so; or
42 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
43 participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services and

HB 2359 43
1 technological assistance.
2 (c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 66, and
3 amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing,
4 assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of

6 in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court
7 shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
8 (d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
9 respondent at a hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto.
10 (e) At a hearing held under section 66, and amendments thereto, the
11 respondent may:

15 (3) otherwise participate in the hearing.
16 (f) Unless excused by the court for good cause, a proposed guardian
17 shall attend a hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto.
18 (g) A hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, must be
19 closed on request of the respondent and a showing of good cause.
20 (h) Any person may request to participate in a hearing under section
21 66, and amendments thereto. The court may grant the request, with or

24 person's participation.
25 New Sec. 71. (a) The existence of a proceeding for or the existence of
26 a guardianship for an adult is a matter of public record unless the court
27 seals the record after:
28 (1) The respondent or individual subject to guardianship requests the

7 (4) A person not otherwise entitled to access court records under this
8 subsection for good cause may request permission from the court for
9 access to court records of the guardianship, including the guardian's report
10 and plan. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest of the
11 respondent or adult subject to guardianship or furthers the public interest
12 and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of the adult.
13 (c) A report under section 67, and amendments thereto, of a court
14 liaison or a professional evaluation under section 69, and amendments
15 thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:
16 (1) The court;

25 court orders for good cause.
26 New Sec. 72. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the
27 court in appointing a guardian for an adult shall consider persons qualified
28 to be guardian in the following order of priority:
29 (1) A guardian, other than a temporary or emergency guardian,
30 currently acting for the respondent in another jurisdiction;

38 (6) a person nominated as guardian by the spouse, adult child or other
39 close family member of the respondent.
40 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection (a),
41 the court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best
42 qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider
43 the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's skills, the

HB 2359 45
1 expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the person and the
2 respondent have similar values and preferences and the likelihood the
3 person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian successfully.
4 (c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
5 decline to appoint as guardian a person having priority under subsection
6 (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.
7 (d) In determining whether the appointment of a proposed guardian is
8 in the best interest of the respondent, the court shall consider the number
9 of other cases in which the proposed guardian, other than a corporation, is
10 currently serving as guardian, particularly if that number is more than 15.
11 (e) The following persons shall not be appointed as guardian unless
12 the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is the best
13 qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the
14 best interest of the respondent:

16 individual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the
17 respondent, or is the spouse, parent or child of an individual who provides
18 or is employed to provide paid services to the respondent;
19 (2) an owner, operator or employee of any entity at which the
20 respondent is receiving care; and
21 (3) a person who provides care or other services, or is an employee of

24 New Sec. 73. (a) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult
25 must:
26 (1) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
27 established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a
28 protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive
29 alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services, technological
30 assistance or supported decision making; and
31 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
32 established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the
33 petition.
34 (b) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must
35 state the basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific findings
36 that support the conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the
37 functional needs of the adult subject to guardianship.
38 (c) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult must
39 state the specific powers granted to the guardian.
40 (d) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult must include the
41 date of a review hearing to be set 90 days after the order of appointment is
42 entered. At that hearing, the court shall review the guardian's plan filed
43 pursuant to section 79, and amendments thereto.

HB 2359 46
1 (e) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an
2 adult, shall identify any person that subsequently is entitled to:

20 (f) A spouse and adult children of an adult subject to guardianship are

24 New Sec. 74. (a) Not later than 14 days after the appointment, a

31 entitled to notice under section 72(e), and amendments thereto, or a
32 subsequent order a statement of the rights of the adult subject to
33 guardianship and procedures to seek relief if the adult is denied those
34 rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, in plain language
35 and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject to
36 guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to
37 guardianship of the right to:
38 (1) Seek termination or modification of the guardianship, or removal
39 of the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these
40 matters;
41 (2) file a grievance against the guardian under section 50, and

5 reasonably feasible and supported in understanding the risks and benefits
6 of healthcare options to the extent reasonably feasible;
7 (5) be notified at least 14 days before a change in the adult's primary
8 dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility or
9 other facility that places restrictions on the individual's ability to leave or
10 have visitors unless the change or move is proposed in the guardian's plan
11 under section 79, and amendments thereto, or authorized by the court by
12 specific order;
13 (6) object to a change or move described in paragraph (5) and the
14 process for objecting;
15 (7) communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving

18 (A) The guardian has been authorized by the court by specific order
19 to restrict communications, visits or interactions;
20 (B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of
21 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
22 or
23 (C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
24 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
25 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction
26 is:
27 (i) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
28 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
29 (ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
30 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult;
31 (8) receive a copy of the guardian's plan under section 79, and

37 New Sec. 75. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
38 section 65, and amendments thereto, or on verified petition by a person
39 interested in an adult's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
40 guardian for the adult if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
41 establish probable cause that:
42 (1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
43 imminent and substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety or

HB 2359 48
1 welfare;
2 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
3 circumstances; and
4 (3) a basis for appointment of a guardian under section 64, and
5 amendments thereto, exists.
6 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult
7 may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only
8 the powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency
9 guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for not more than
10 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions
11 for appointment of an emergency guardian in subsection (a) continue.
12 (c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an
13 emergency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to
14 represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided
15 in subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of a
16 hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the respondent's
17 attorney and any other person the court determines.
18 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult
19 without notice to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the court
20 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physical health,
21 safety or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing with notice
22 on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency
23 guardian without giving notice under subsection (c), the court must:
24 (1) Give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
25 appointment to:
26 (A) The respondent;
27 (B) the respondent's attorney; and
28 (C) any other person the court determines; and
29 (2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later
30 than five days after the appointment.
31 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a
32 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under
33 section 64, and amendments thereto.
34 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
35 this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the
36 court requires.
37 New Sec. 76. (a) A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary. A guardian
38 shall strive to assure that the personal, civil and human rights of the
39 individual subject to guardianship are protected. Except as otherwise
40 limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions regarding
41 the support, care, education, health and welfare of the adult subject to
42 guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's limitations and in
43 accordance with the guardian's plan under section 79, and amendments

HB 2359 49
1 thereto.
2 (b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the
3 adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, include the adult in decision
4 making, and encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act on the
5 adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the
6 adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
7 (1) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and
8 maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular
9 visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities
10 and physical and mental health;
11 (2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and
12 preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the
13 adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities or
14 social interactions; and
15 (3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive
16 relationships and services for the adult.
17 (c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care,
18 diligence and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for
19 the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
20 (1) Take reasonable care of the personal effects and service or support
21 animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or
22 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect
23 the adult's property;
24 (2) if authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
25 thereto, expend funds and other property of the adult received by the
26 guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health
27 and welfare;
28 (3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended
29 under paragraph (2) for the adult's future needs, but if a conservator has
30 been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other property at least
31 quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the adult's future needs;
32 and
33 (4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services,
34 provided to the adult.
35 (d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
36 guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the
37 adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would
38 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
39 interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to
40 guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's
41 previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, cultural practices,
42 religious beliefs, values and actions, to the extent actually known or
43 reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.

HB 2359 50
1 (e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under subsection
2 (d) because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine
3 the decision the adult probably would make if able, or the guardian
4 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
5 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
6 interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best
7 interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the adult, the
8 guardian shall consider:
9 (1) Information received from professionals and persons that
10 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;
11 (2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have
12 considered if the adult were able to act; and
13 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult
14 would consider, including consequences for others.
15 (f) A guardian for an adult shall notify the court immediately if the
16 condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising
17 rights previously removed.
18 New Sec. 77. (a) Except as limited by court order, a guardian for an
19 adult may:
20 (1) If authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
21 thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
22 adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application or
23 receipt is within the powers of the conservator;
24 (2) establish the adult's place of dwelling;
25 (3) consent to health, including mental health, or other care, treatment
26 or service for the adult;
27 (4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed, commence a
28 proceeding including an administrative proceeding, or take other
29 appropriate action to compel another person to support the adult or pay
30 funds for the adult's benefit; and
31 (5) receive personally identifiable healthcare information regarding
32 the adult.
33 (b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
34 to consent to the adoption of the adult.
35 (c) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult
36 to litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce, dissolution or
37 annulment of marriage of the individual subject to guardianship, including
38 negotiation of a settlement thereof.
39 (d) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection (b)
40 or (c), the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in
41 accordance with the adult's preferences, values and prior directions and
42 whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.
43 (e) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(2) to

HB 2359 51
1 establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:
2 (1) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would
3 select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making
4 standard in section 76(d) and (e), and amendments thereto. If the guardian
5 does not know and cannot reasonably determine what setting the adult
6 subject to guardianship probably would choose if able, or the guardian
7 reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would
8 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
9 interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance with section
10 76(e), and amendments thereto, a residential setting that is consistent with
11 the adult's best interest;
12 (2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a
13 residential setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with
14 persons important to the adult and meet the adult's needs in the least
15 restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
16 inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 76(d) and (e),
17 and amendments thereto;
18 (3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the adult:
19 (A) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult and any person
20 identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing the
21 guardian or a subsequent order; and
22 (B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new dwelling
23 and state whether the adult received advance notice of the change and
24 whether the adult objected to the change;
25 (4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult to
26 a nursing home, mental health facility or other facility that places
27 restrictions on the adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
28 (A) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under section
29 79, and amendments thereto;
30 (B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or
31 (C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at least 14
32 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons entitled
33 to notice under section 73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent
34 order, and no objection is filed;
35 (5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside this
36 state only if consistent with the guardian's plan and authorized by the court
37 by specific order; and
38 (6) take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the lease
39 to the primary dwelling of the adult only if:
40 (A) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan under
41 section 79, and amendments thereto;
42 (B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or
43 (C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the action to

HB 2359 52
1 the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under section 73(e)(2), and
2 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order and no objection has been
3 filed.
4 (f) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(3) to make
5 healthcare decisions, the guardian shall:
6 (1) Involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably
7 feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting the
8 adult in understanding the risks and benefits of healthcare options;
9 (2) act in accordance with any declaration of the adult made pursuant
10 to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109, and amendments
11 thereto; and
12 (3) take into account:
13 (A) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
14 (B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult, if known
15 or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
16 New Sec. 78. (a) A guardian for an adult may not initiate the
17 commitment of the adult to a mental health facility except in accordance
18 with the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons, K.S.A. 59-2945 et
19 seq., and amendments thereto.
20 (b) A guardian for an adult may not restrict the ability of the adult to
21 communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving visitors and
22 making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or electronic
23 communications, including through social media, or participating in social
24 activities, unless:
25 (1) Authorized by the court by specific order;
26 (2) a protective order or a protective arrangement instead of
27 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person;
28 or
29 (3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
30 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
31 physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult and the restriction is:
32 (A) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
33 has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
34 (B) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not have
35 a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult.
36 (c) A guardian for an adult may not consent, on behalf of the adult, to:
37 (1) Any psychosurgery, removal of any bodily organ or amputation of
38 any limb, unless such surgery, removal or amputation has been approved
39 in advance by the court, except in an emergency and when necessary to
40 preserve the life of the adult or to prevent serious and irreparable
41 impairment to the physical health of the adult;
42 (2) the sterilization of the adult, unless approved by the court
43 following a due process hearing held for the purposes of determining

HB 2359 53
1 whether to approve such, and during which hearing the adult is represented
2 by an attorney appointed by the court;
3 (3) the performance of any experimental biomedical or behavioral
4 procedure on the adult, or for the adult to be a participant in any
5 biomedical or behavioral experiment, without the prior review and
6 approval of such by either an institutional review board as provided for in
7 title 45, part 46 of the code of federal regulations, or if such regulations do
8 not apply, then by a review committee established by the agency,
9 institution or treatment facility at which the procedure or experiment is
10 proposed to occur, composed of members selected for the purposes of
11 determining whether the proposed procedure or experiment:
12 (A) Does not involve any significant risk of harm to the physical or
13 mental health of the adult, or the use of aversive stimulants, and is
14 intended to preserve the life or health of the adult or to assist the adult to
15 develop or regain skills or abilities; or
16 (B) involves a significant risk of harm to the physical or mental
17 health of the adult, or the use of an aversive stimulant, but that the
18 conducting of the proposed procedure or experiment is intended either to
19 preserve the life of the adult, or to significantly improve the quality of life
20 of the adult, or to assist the adult to develop or regain significant skills or
21 abilities, and that the guardian has been fully informed concerning the
22 potential risks and benefits of the proposed procedure or experiment or of
23 any aversive stimulant proposed to be used, and as to how and under what
24 circumstances the aversive stimulant may be used, and has specifically
25 consented to such;
26 (4) the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-sustaining
27 medical care, treatment, services or procedures, except:
28 (A) In accordance with the provisions of any declaration of the adult
29 made pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109,
30 and amendments thereto; or
31 (B) if the adult, prior to the court's appointment of a guardian, has
32 executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions pursuant to
33 K.S.A. 58-625, et seq., and amendments thereto, and that durable power of
34 attorney has not previously been revoked by the adult, and it includes any
35 provision relevant to the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
36 sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures, then the
37 guardian shall have the authority to act as provided for in that power of
38 attorney, even if the guardian has revoked or amended that power of
39 attorney pursuant to the authority of K.S.A. 58-627, and amendments
40 thereto; or
41 (C) in the circumstances where the adult's treating physician certifies
42 in writing to the guardian that the adult is in a persistent vegetative state or
43 is suffering from an illness or other medical condition for which further

HB 2359 54
1 treatment, other than for the relief of pain, would not likely prolong the life
2 of the adult other than by artificial means, nor would be likely to restore to
3 the adult any significant degree of capabilities beyond those the adult
4 currently possesses, and which opinion is concurred in by either a second
5 physician or by any medical ethics or similar committee to which the
6 healthcare provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing
7 such circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's
8 order which would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-
9 saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures.
10 The court shall review the written certification within 72 hours at a due
11 process hearing during which the adult is represented by an attorney
12 appointed by the court. The court may request that the state protection and
13 advocacy agency as provided by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or K.S.A. 74-
14 5515(a)(2)(A) and (B), and amendments thereto, or 42 U.S.C. 15043, 42
15 U.S.C. 10805 or 29 U.S.C. 794e represent the adult. Upon completion of
16 the hearing, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
17 adult meets the conditions set forth in this section, the court shall approve
18 the written certification. If the court does not find by clear and convincing
19 evidence that the adult meets the conditions set forth in this section, then
20 the written certification shall not be approved.
21 (d) A guardian for an adult may not exercise any control or authority
22 over the adult's estate, unless specifically authorized by the court. Any
23 guardian who is granted such authority must prepare an inventory and
24 provide notice of the inventory as provided in section 104, and
25 amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to the guardian
26 and may waive the requirement of the posting of a bond, only if:
27 (1) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by the
28 adult equals $25,000 or less; and
29 (2) either the court requires the guardian to report to the court the
30 commencement of the exercising of such authority, or requires the
31 guardian to obtain court authorization to commence the exercise of such
32 authority, as the court shall specify; and
33 (3) the court also requires the guardian, whenever the combined value
34 of such funds and property exceeds $25,000, to:
35 (A) File a guardian's plan as provided for in section 79, and
36 amendments thereto, that contains elements similar to those that would be
37 contained in a conservator's plan as provided for in section 103, and
38 amendments thereto;
39 (B) petition the court for appointment of a conservator; or
40 (C) notify the court as the court shall specify that the value of the
41 adult's estate has equaled or exceeded $25,000, if the court has earlier
42 appointed a conservator but did not issue letters of conservatorship
43 pending such notification;

HB 2359 55

8 be based on the needs of the adult and take into account the best interest of
9 the adult as well as the adult's preferences, values and prior directions, to
10 the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. The

27 (b) A guardian shall give notice of the filing of the guardian's plan
28 under subsection (a), together with a copy of the plan, to the adult subject
29 to guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
30 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and
31 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
32 determines. The notice must include a statement of the right to object to

36 object to the plan in writing no later than 21 days after the filing.
37 (d) The court shall review the guardian's plan filed under subsection
38 (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new plan. In
39 deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an objection
40 under subsection (c) and whether the plan is consistent with the guardian's
41 duties and powers under sections 76 and 77, and amendments thereto. The
42 court shall review an initial guardian's plan at the review hearing
43 scheduled under section 73(b), and amendments thereto. When reviewing

HB 2359 56
1 subsequent guardian's plans, the court has discretion whether to set the
2 matter for hearing but may not approve the plan until 30 days after the
3 filing.
4 (e) After the guardian's plan filed under this section is approved by
5 the court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the adult subject
6 to guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
7 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and

29 prior directions and best interest;
30 (8) anything of more than de minimis value which the guardian, any
31 individual who resides with the guardian, or the spouse, parent, child or

37 perceived as self-serving or adverse to the position or best interest of the
38 adult, including, but not limited to, being paid for providing caregiver
39 services to the adult;

6 (13) a recommendation as to the need for continued guardianship and
7 any recommended change in the scope of the guardianship, including
8 whether the condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable
9 of exercising rights previously removed; and
10 (14) whether any co-guardian or successor guardian appointed to
11 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve.
12 (c) A guardian for an adult shall file a special report with the court
13 upon the occurrence of any of the following:
14 (1) A change of address of the guardian;
15 (2) a change of residence or placement of the adult;

28 under this section or a guardian's plan submitted under section 79, and
29 amendments thereto, interview the guardian or adult subject to
30 guardianship or investigate any other matter involving the guardianship.
31 (e) Notice of the filing under this section of a guardian's report or
32 special report, together with a copy of the report, must be given to the
33 adult subject to guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section
34 73(e), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other
35 person the court determines. The notice and report must be given not later
36 than 14 days after the filing.
37 (f) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
38 submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to

41 guardian has complied with the guardian's duties;
42 (2) the guardianship should continue; and
43 (3) the guardian's requested fees, if any, should be approved.

HB 2359 58
1 (g) If the court determines that there is reason to believe a guardian
2 for an adult has not complied with the guardian's duties or the

5 to notice under section 73(e), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent

18 report filed under this section. The court after review may approve the

24 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a
25 guardian for an adult and appoint a successor guardian on:
26 (1) Petition of the adult, guardian or person interested in the welfare
27 of the adult, which contains allegations that, if true, would support a
28 reasonable belief that removal of the guardian and appointment of a
29 successor guardian may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a
30 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
31 filed during the preceding six months;
32 (2) communication from the adult, guardian or person interested in
33 the welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that removal of

12 the adult or a person interested in the welfare of the adult may petition for:
13 (1) Termination of the guardianship on the ground that a basis for
14 appointment under section 64, and amendments thereto, does not exist or
15 termination would be in the best interest of the adult or for other good
16 cause; or
17 (2) modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of
18 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause.
19 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
20 or modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on:
21 (1) Petition under subsection (a) which contains allegations that, if

23 the guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a
24 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
25 filed during the preceding six months;
26 (2) communication from the adult, guardian or person interested in

29 the functional needs of the adult or supports or services available to the

8 follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the adult which

33 or other property needed for the support, care, education, health or welfare
34 of the minor.
35 (b) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a
36 conservator for the property or financial affairs of an adult if the court

38 (2) the attorney appointed by the court to represent the respondent;
39 (3) any law enforcement officer; or

43 thereto, the notice required under subsection (b) must be given to the

HB 2359 64
1 persons required to be listed in the petition under section 84(b)(1) through
2 (3), and amendments thereto, and any other person interested in the
3 respondent's welfare the court determines. Failure to give notice under this
4 subsection does not preclude the court from appointing a conservator.
5 (d) After the appointment of a conservator, notice of a hearing on a
6 petition for any other order under sections 83 through 118, and
7 amendments thereto, together with a copy of the petition, must be given to:

9 years of age or older and not missing, detained or unable to return to the
10 United States;
11 (2) the conservator; and
12 (3) any other person the court determines.
13 New Sec. 86. While a petition under section 84, and amendments
14 thereto, is pending, after preliminary hearing and without notice to others,
15 the court may issue an order to preserve and apply property of the
16 respondent as required for the support of the respondent or an individual
17 who is in fact dependent on the respondent. The court may appoint an
18 emergency conservator to assist in implementing the order.
19 New Sec. 87. (a) If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a
20 conservator is a minor, the court may appoint a court liaison to investigate

22 about the petition or a related matter.
23 (b) If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a conservator is an
24 adult, the court may appoint a court liaison. The duties and reporting
25 requirements of the court liaison are limited to the relief requested in the
26 petition. The court liaison must be an individual with training or

31 best able to understand:
32 (A) Explain, in general, the petition, and the nature and purpose of
33 the proceeding, including the potential loss of rights as a result of the
34 proceeding; and
35 (B) obtain the respondent's views about the appointment sought by
36 the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the
37 conservator's proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of
38 the proposed conservatorship.
39 (2) These explanations and discussions are not intended to be a
40 substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to inform
41 the respondent of the respondent's rights and the nature and purpose of the
42 proceeding.
43 (d) A court liaison appointed under subsection (b) for an adult may be

HB 2359 65

2 presiding judge:
3 (1) Interview the petitioner and proposed conservator, if any;
4 (2) review financial records of the respondent, if relevant to the court
5 liaison's recommendation under subsection (e)(1);
6 (3) investigate whether the respondent's needs could be met by a
7 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
8 alternative and, if so, identify the arrangement or other less restrictive
9 alternative; and
10 (4) investigate the allegations in the petition and any other matter
11 relating to the petition as directed by the court, including, but not limited
12 to, the respondent's family relationships, past conduct, the nature and
13 extent of any property or income of the respondent, whether the
14 respondent is likely to injure self or others and other matters as the court
15 may specify.
16 (e) A court liaison appointed under subsection (b) for an adult shall
17 file a report with the court at least 10 days prior to the hearing on the
18 petition or other hearing as directed by the court. Unless otherwise ordered
19 by the court, such report must include:
20 (1) A recommendation:
21 (A) Regarding the appropriateness of conservatorship, or whether a
22 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
23 alternative for meeting the respondent's needs is available;
24 (B) if a conservatorship is recommended, whether it should be full or
25 limited; and
26 (C) if a limited conservatorship is recommended, the powers to be
27 granted to the conservator, and the property that should be placed under
28 the conservator's control;
29 (2) a statement of the qualifications of the proposed conservator and

34 (4) a statement whether the respondent is able to participate in a
35 hearing and which identifies any technology or other form of support that
36 would enhance the respondent's ability to participate; and
37 (5) any other matter the court directs.
38 (d) The costs of an investigation by a court liaison shall be assessed
39 as provided for in section 42, and amendments thereto.
40 New Sec. 88. (a) Unless the respondent in a proceeding for
41 appointment of a conservator is represented by an attorney, the court shall
42 appoint an attorney to represent the respondent, regardless of the
43 respondent's ability to pay. The court shall give preference in the

HB 2359 66
1 appointment of an attorney to any attorney who has represented the
2 respondent in other matters if the court has knowledge of that prior
3 representation or to an attorney whom the respondent has requested. Any
4 appointment made by the court shall terminate after the conservator's plan
5 has been approved and after any appeal from the appointment of a
6 conservator, unless the court continues the appointment by further order.
7 Thereafter, an attorney may be appointed by the court if requested, in
8 writing, by the adult subject to conservatorship, the conservator or upon
9 the court's own motion.
10 (b) An attorney representing the respondent in a proceeding for
11 appointment of a conservator shall:
12 (1) Make reasonable efforts to ascertain the respondent's wishes;
13 (2) advocate for the respondent's wishes to the extent reasonably
14 ascertainable; and
15 (3) if the respondent's wishes are not reasonably ascertainable,
16 advocate for the result that is the least-restrictive in type, duration and
17 scope, consistent with the respondent's interests.
18 (c) An attorney representing the respondent shall interview the
19 respondent in person and, in a manner the respondent is best able to
20 understand:

27 the proposed conservatorship; and
28 (3) inform the respondent that all costs and expenses of the
29 proceeding, including respondent's attorney fees, may be paid from the
30 respondent's assets.
31 (d) The court shall appoint an attorney to represent a parent of a
32 minor who is the subject of a proceeding under section 84, and
33 amendments thereto, if the court determines the parent needs
34 representation.
35 New Sec. 89. (a) Upon the filing of the petition or any other time at
36 or before the hearing, if the contents of the petition or evidence at the
37 hearing support a prima facie case of the need for a conservator, the court
38 shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
39 conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
40 mental health center or community developmental disability organization,
41 or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician assistant,
42 nurse practitioner, social worker or other professional appointed by the
43 court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged cognitive and

HB 2359 67
1 functional abilities and limitations and will not be advantaged or

11 (4) a prognosis for any improvement and, as appropriate, any
12 recommendation for treatment or rehabilitation;
13 (5) a list and description of any prior assessments, evaluations or
14 examinations of the respondent, including the dates thereof, which were
15 relied upon in the preparation of this evaluation;
16 (6) the date and location where this examination and evaluation
17 occurred, and the name or names of the professional or professionals
18 performing the examination and evaluation and such professional's

22 respondent, and that the report submitted to the court contains the results
23 of that examination and evaluation, and the professional's opinion with
24 regard to the issues of whether or not the respondent is in need of a
25 conservator and whether there are barriers to the respondent's attendance
26 and participation at the hearing on the petition; and

28 (c) The professional shall file with the court, at least five days prior to

31 available by the court to counsel for all parties.
32 (d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation as
33 provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
34 accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this
35 section and that no further examination or evaluation should be required,
36 unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such an
37 examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be filed with
38 the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at least four days
39 prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request shall be a statement
40 of the reasons why an examination and evaluation is requested and the

42 conduct this examination and evaluation. If the court orders a further
43 examination and evaluation, the court may continue the trial and fix a new

HB 2359 68
1 date, time and place of the trial at a time not to exceed 30 days from the
2 date of the filing of the request.
3 New Sec. 90. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
4 hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may not proceed unless
5 the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the

7 are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the hearing at an
8 alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow the respondent
9 to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual technology.
10 (b) A hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may
11 proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
12 and convincing evidence that:
13 (1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after having
14 been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential consequences
15 of failing to do so;
16 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
17 participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services or
18 technological assistance; or
19 (3) the respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and
20 attendance would be harmful to the minor.
21 (c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 85, and
22 amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's choosing,
23 assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a combination of
24 these supports. If assistance would facilitate the respondent's participation
25 in the hearing, but is not otherwise available to the respondent, the court
26 shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
27 (d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
28 respondent at a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto.
29 (e) At a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, the

HB 2359 69
1 person's participation.
2 New Sec. 91. (a) The existence of a proceeding for or the existence of

28 (4) A person not otherwise entitled to access to court records under
29 this section for good cause may request permission from the court for
30 access to court records of the conservatorship, including the conservator's
31 plan and report. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest
32 of the respondent or individual subject to conservatorship or furthers the
33 public interest and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of
34 the respondent or individual.
35 (c) A report under section 87, and amendments thereto, of a court

37 thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

19 other close family member of the respondent.
20 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection (a),
21 the court shall select as conservator the person the court considers best
22 qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider
23 the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's skills, the
24 expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the person and the
25 respondent have similar values and preferences and the likelihood the
26 person will be able to perform the duties of a conservator successfully.
27 (c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
28 decline to appoint as conservator a person having priority under subsection
29 (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.

1 that the court has removed the conservator.

HB 2359 73
1 New Sec. 95. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
2 section 84, and amendments thereto, or on a verified petition by a person
3 interested in an individual's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
4 conservator for the individual if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
5 establish probable cause that:
6 (1) Appointment of an emergency conservator is necessary to prevent
7 imminent, substantial and irreparable harm to the individual's property or
8 financial interests;
9 (2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
10 circumstances; and
11 (3) a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and
12 amendments thereto, exists.
13 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not
14 exceed 30 days and the emergency conservator may exercise only the
15 powers specified in the order of appointment. The emergency conservator's
16 authority may be extended up to three times for not more than 30 days per
17 extension if the court finds good cause and that the conditions for
18 appointment of an emergency conservator under subsection (a) continue.
19 (c) Immediately on filing of a petition for an emergency conservator,
20 the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the
21 proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), reasonable

23 given to the respondent, the respondent's attorney and any other person the
24 court determines.
25 (d) The court may appoint an emergency conservator without notice
26 to the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court
27 finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's property or
28 financial interests will be substantially and irreparably harmed before a
29 hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints
30 an emergency conservator without giving notice under subsection (c), the
31 court must give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
32 appointment to:
33 (1) The respondent;
34 (2) the respondent's attorney; and

36 (e) Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold
37 a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment.
38 (f) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is
39 not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator
40 under section 83, and amendments thereto.
41 (g) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under
42 this section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report

17 (g) granting other appropriate relief.
18 New Sec. 97. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the
19 court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety, or require
20 an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on faithful
21 discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive the
22 requirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-protection
23 arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the individual
24 subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),
25 the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is in the
26 business of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the conservator's
27 service.
28 (b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this
29 section must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the
30 conservatorship estate, plus one year's estimated income, less the value of
31 property deposited under an arrangement requiring a court order for its
32 removal, and less the value of real property. The court, in place of surety

3 appointive instrument of the individual.

5 personal property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the
6 conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the
7 court finds:
8 (1) The property lacks sufficient equity; or
9 (2) insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the
10 conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the
11 individual.

13 the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided by the
14 revised uniform fiduciary access to digital assets act or court order.

32 duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction is
33 authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under
34 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order. A
35 transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale, encumbrance
36 or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate entered into by
37 the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the
38 spouse, descendant, sibling, agent or attorney of the conservator, or a
39 corporation or other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial
40 beneficial interest.
41 New Sec. 108. (a) A person that assists or deals with a conservator in
42 good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction
43 requiring a court order under section 102, and amendments thereto, is

HB 2359 86
1 protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in
2 question. Knowledge alone by a person that the person is dealing with a
3 conservator does not require the person to inquire into the existence of
4 authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's exercise
5 of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of office, or
6 otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that
7 pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper
8 application of the property.
9 (b) Protection under subsection (a) extends to a procedural
10 irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the
11 issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a
12 person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable
13 provisions in law of this state other than this act relating to a commercial
14 transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary.
15 New Sec. 109. (a) If an individual subject to conservatorship dies, the
16 conservator shall deliver to the district court any will of the individual that
17 is in the conservator's possession and inform the personal representative
18 named in the will if feasible. The conservator shall give notice of the
19 delivery of the will under this section to any person entitled to notice under
20 section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
21 (b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
22 conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate
23 as provided in section 113, and amendments thereto.
24 New Sec. 110. (a) A conservator may pay a claim against the
25 conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising
26 before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in
27 accordance with the priorities under subsection (d). A claimant may
28 present a claim by:
29 (1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of
30 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and
31 the amount claimed; or
32 (2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court,
33 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
34 (b) A claim under subsection (a) is presented on receipt by the
35 conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the
36 claim, whichever occurs first. A presented claim is allowed, if it is not
37 disallowed in whole or in part, by the conservator in a record sent or
38 delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation.
39 Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to
40 a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court
41 order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls
42 until 30 days after disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of
43 limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.

HB 2359 87
1 (c) A claimant whose claim under subsection (a) has not been paid
2 may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred
3 by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment
4 or security by encumbering property included in the conservatorship
5 estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual subject to
6 conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator or is
7 initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator notice of
8 the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the
9 conservatorship estate.
10 (d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all
11 existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in
12 money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:
13 (1) Costs and expenses of administration;
14 (2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority under
15 law other than this act;
16 (3) a claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education,
17 health or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to
18 conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual
19 subject to conservatorship;
20 (4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and
21 (5) all other claims.
22 (e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under
23 subsection (d) over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
24 payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
25 (1) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without
26 sufficient funds to pay the basic living and healthcare expenses of the
27 individual subject to conservatorship; and
28 (2) the court authorizes the preference under section 102(a)(8), and
29 amendments thereto.
30 (f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all
31 existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual
32 subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a security
33 interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future
34 date.
35 New Sec. 111. (a) Except as otherwise agreed by a conservator, the
36 conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in a
37 fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the conservatorship
38 estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's representative
39 capacity in the contract or before entering into the contract.
40 (b) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from
41 control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission
42 occurring in the course of administration of the conservatorship estate only
43 if the conservator is personally at fault.

HB 2359 88
1 (c) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a
2 fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included
3 in the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of
4 administration of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against the
5 conservatorship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a
6 fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable for
7 the claim.
8 (d) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the
9 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting,
10 surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action.
11 New Sec. 112. (a) The court may remove a conservator for failure to
12 perform the conservator's duties or other good cause and appoint a
13 successor conservator to assume the duties of the conservator.
14 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a
15 conservator and appoint a successor on:
16 (1) Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator
17 or person interested in the welfare of the individual which contains
18 allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that removal of
19 the conservator and appointment of a successor may be appropriate, but
20 the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or
21 substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding six months;
22 (2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
23 conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
24 supports a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and
25 appointment of a successor may be appropriate;
26 (3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
27 interest of the individual subject to conservatorship; or
28 (4) determination by the court that the conservator's reports and
29 accountings are delinquent or deficient as filed.
30 (c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or any hearing under
31 this section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the
32 conservator, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and
33 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
34 determines.
35 (d) If the individual subject to conservatorship is not represented by
36 an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions
37 as in section 88, and amendments thereto. The court shall award
38 reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in section 42, and
39 amendments thereto.
40 (e) In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the
41 priorities under section 92, and amendments thereto.
42 (f) Not later than 30 days after appointing a successor conservator,
43 the court or court's designee shall give notice of the appointment to the

HB 2359 89
1 individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice
2 under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
3 New Sec. 113. (a) A conservatorship for a minor terminates on the
4 earliest of:
5 (1) A court order terminating the conservatorship;
6 (2) the minor becoming an adult except as provided in section 114,
7 and amendments thereto;
8 (3) emancipation of the minor; or
9 (4) death of the minor.
10 (b) A conservatorship for an adult terminates on order of the court or
11 when the adult dies.
12 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a
13 person interested in the welfare of the individual may petition for:
14 (1) Termination of the conservatorship on the ground that a basis for
15 appointment under section 83, and amendments thereto, does not exist or
16 termination would be in the best interest of the individual or for other good
17 cause; or
18 (2) modification of the conservatorship on the ground that the extent
19 of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good
20 cause.
21 (d) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination
22 or modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on:
23 (1) Petition under subsection (c) which contains allegations that, if
24 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of
25 the conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold
26 a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was
27 filed within the preceding six months;
28 (2) a communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
29 conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
30 supports a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the
31 conservatorship may be appropriate, including because the functional
32 needs of the individual or supports or services available to the individual
33 have changed;
34 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
35 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
36 needs or supports or services available to the individual have changed or a
37 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
38 alternative is available; or
39 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
40 interest of the individual.
41 (e) Notice of a petition under subsection (c) or of a hearing under this
42 section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship, the
43 conservator, a person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and

HB 2359 90
1 amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the court
2 determines.
3 (f) After the hearing, the court shall order termination unless it is
4 proven that a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83, and
5 amendments thereto, continues to exist.
6 (g) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the
7 powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities or
8 limitations of the individual subject to conservatorship, the individual's
9 supports or other circumstances.
10 (h) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before
11 terminating a conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures
12 to safeguard the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship which
13 apply to a petition for conservatorship.
14 (i) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to terminate or
15 modify the terms of the conservatorship has the right to retain an attorney
16 to represent the individual in this matter. If the individual is not
17 represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the
18 same conditions as in section 88, and amendments thereto. The court shall
19 award reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in section 42,
20 and amendments thereto.
21 (j) On termination of a conservatorship other than by reason of the
22 death of the individual subject to conservatorship, property of the

24 must direct the conservator to file a final report and petition for discharge
25 on approval by the court of the final report.
26 (k) On termination of a conservatorship by reason of the death of the
27 individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator promptly shall file a
28 final report and petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final
29 report. On approval of the final report, the conservator shall proceed
30 expeditiously to distribute the conservatorship estate to the individual's
31 estate or as otherwise ordered by the court. The conservator may take
32 reasonable measures necessary to preserve the conservatorship estate until
33 distribution can be made.
34 (l) The court shall issue a final order of discharge on the approval by
35 the court of the final report and satisfaction by the conservator of any other
36 condition the court imposed on the conservator's discharge.
37 (m) Not later than 30 days after entering an order under this section,
38 the court or the court's designee shall give notice of the order to the adult
39 subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice under section
40 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
41 New Sec. 114. (a) A conservatorship for a minor may be extended
42 beyond the minor's 18th birthday if the minor consents or the court finds by
43 clear and convincing evidence that substantial harm to the minor's interests

HB 2359 91
1 is otherwise likely. A conservatorship may be extended under this section
2 until the minor reaches the age of 21 and may be extended for two
3 additional two-year periods upon the same finding by the court or upon
4 consent of the minor. Consent to the extension of a conservatorship may be
5 withdrawn at any time.
6 (b) Any request to extend a minor conservatorship under this section
7 must be accompanied by:
8 (1) A description of the funds or assets of the minor's estate which the
9 conservator proposes to distribute to the minor over an extended period
10 following the minor's 18th birthday;
11 (2) the factual basis upon which the conservator alleges the need for
12 such an extended distribution plan; and
13 (3) a proposed conservator's plan that describes how the distribution
14 will occur.
15 (c) The court shall appoint an attorney to represent the minor as
16 provided in section 88, and amendments thereto.
17 (d) After a hearing, the court may extend a conservatorship for a
18 minor and grant to the conservator the authority to establish an extended
19 distribution plan if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
20 (1) Substantial harm to the minor's interests is likely if the
21 conservatorship is not extended; and
22 (2) the plan approved by the court adequately provides for meeting
23 the expected needs of the minor from the minor's 18th birthday until the
24 final distribution of the funds or assets which the court authorizes to be set
25 aside or transferred from the estate are paid over to the minor, including
26 provisions for accelerated distribution in extraordinary circumstances,
27 which may require court approval.
28 (e) If the court orders a conservatorship for a minor to be extended
29 under this section, the court shall order the conservator to report any
30 expenditure or transfer of funds or assets from the minor's estate for the
31 purposes of effectuating an extended distribution plan within the
32 conservator's next accounting.
33 (f) The court may extend the conservatorship with regard to specific
34 funds or assets of the minor's estate, even though other funds or assets of
35 the minor's estate are paid over to the minor upon the minor's becoming 18
36 years of age.
37 (g) The minor shall be without the power, voluntarily or involuntarily,
38 to sell, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, assign, alienate, anticipate, transfer
39 or convey any interest in the principal or the income from any funds or
40 assets of the minor's estate set aside or transferred to effectuate a plan for
41 extended distribution until such is actually paid to the minor.
42 New Sec. 115. (a) Unless a person required to transfer funds or other
43 property to a minor knows that a conservator for the minor has been

HB 2359 92
1 appointed or a proceeding is pending for conservatorship, the person may
2 transfer an amount or value not exceeding $25,000 in a 12-month period
3 to:
4 (1) A person that has care or custody of the minor and with whom the
5 minor resides;
6 (2) a guardian for the minor;
7 (3) a custodian under the uniform transfers to minors act; or
8 (4) a financial institution as a deposit in an interest-bearing account or
9 certificate solely in the name of the minor and shall give notice to the
10 minor of the deposit.
11 (b) A person that transfers funds or other property under this section
12 is not responsible for its proper application.
13 (c) A person that receives funds or other property for a minor under
14 subsection (a)(1) or (2) may apply it only to the support, care, education,
15 health or welfare of the minor, and may not derive a personal financial
16 benefit from it, except for reimbursement for necessary expenses. Funds
17 not applied for these purposes must be preserved for the future support,
18 care, education, health or welfare of the minor, and the balance, if any,
19 transferred to the minor when the minor becomes an adult or otherwise is
20 emancipated.
21 (d) Any accumulated balance under this section shall be subject to
22 other provisions of this act.
23 New Sec. 116. The parent of a minor has the right and responsibility
24 to hold in trust and manage for the minor's benefit all of the personal and
25 real property vested in such minor when the total of such property does not
26 exceed $25,000 in value, unless a guardian or conservator has been
27 appointed for the minor.
28 New Sec. 117. (a) Any court having either control over or possession
29 of any amount of money not exceeding $100,000, the right to which is
30 vested in a minor, shall have the discretion to authorize, without the
31 appointment of a conservator or the giving of bond, and notwithstanding
32 the authority of a parent as provided for in section 116, and amendments
33 thereto, the deposit of the money in a savings account of a bank, credit
34 union, savings and loan association or any other investment account that
35 the court may authorize, payable either to a conservator, if one shall be
36 appointed for the minor, or to the minor upon attaining 18 years of age.
37 (b) Any court having either control over or possession of any amount
38 of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested in a minor,
39 shall have the discretion to order the payment of the money to any person,
40 including the parent of the minor, or the minor. If the person is the
41 conservator for the minor, the court may waive or recommend the waiver
42 of the requirement of a bond. If the person is anyone other than the minor,
43 the court shall order that person to hold in trust and manage the minor's

HB 2359 93
1 estate for the minor's benefit.
2 New Sec. 118. Any court having either control over or possession of
3 any amount of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested
4 in an adult subject to guardianship, shall have the discretion to authorize,
5 without the appointment of a conservator or the giving of bond, the deposit
6 of the money in a savings account of a bank, credit union or savings and
7 loan association, payable to the guardian for the benefit of the adult subject
8 to guardianship if authorized pursuant to section 78(c), and amendments
9 thereto, payable to a conservator, if one shall be appointed for the adult, or
10 payable to the adult subject to guardianship upon termination of the
11 guardianship.
12 New Sec. 119. (a) On receiving a petition for a guardianship for an
13 adult, a court may order a protective arrangement instead of guardianship
14 as a less restrictive alternative to guardianship.
15 (b) On receiving a petition for a conservatorship for an individual, a
16 court may order a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship as a
17 less restrictive alternative to conservatorship.
18 (c) A person interested in an adult's welfare, including the adult or a
19 conservator for the adult, may petition under sections 119 through 130,
20 and amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of
21 guardianship.
22 (d) The following persons may petition under sections 119 through
23 130, and amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of
24 conservatorship:
25 (1) The individual for whom the protective arrangement is sought;
26 (2) a person interested in the property, financial affairs or welfare of
27 the individual, including a person that would be affected adversely by lack
28 of effective management of property or financial affairs of the individual;

31 New Sec. 120. (a) After the hearing on a petition under section 65,
32 and amendments thereto, for a guardianship or under section 119(b), and
33 amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of guardianship,
34 the court may issue an order under subsection (b) for a protective
35 arrangement instead of guardianship if the court finds by clear and
36 convincing evidence that:
37 (1) The respondent lacks the ability to meet essential requirements for
38 physical health, safety or self-care because the respondent is unable to
39 receive and evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even
40 with appropriate supportive services, technological assistance or supported
41 decision making; and
42 (2) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a less
43 restrictive alternative.

HB 2359 94
1 (b) If the court makes the findings under subsection (a), the court,
2 instead of appointing a guardian, may:
3 (1) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to meet the
4 respondent's need for health, safety or care, including:
5 (A) A particular medical treatment or refusal of a particular medical
6 treatment;
7 (B) a move to a specified place of dwelling; or
8 (C) visitation between the respondent and another person;
9 (2) order supervised visitation with, or restrict access to the
10 respondent by, a specified person whose access places the respondent at
11 serious risk of physical, psychological or financial harm; and
12 (3) order other arrangements on a limited basis that are appropriate.
13 (c) In deciding whether to issue an order under this section, the court
14 shall consider the factors under sections 76 and 77, and amendments
15 thereto, which a guardian must consider when making a decision on behalf
16 of an adult subject to guardianship.
17 (d) Any order issued under this section may include reporting

22 119(c), and amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of
23 conservatorship for an adult, the court may issue an order under subsection
24 (c) for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for the adult if
25 the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
26 (1) The adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs
27 because:
28 (A) Of a limitation in the ability to receive and evaluate information
29 or make or communicate decisions, even with appropriate supportive
30 services, technological assistance or supported decision making; or
31 (B) the adult is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United
32 States;

34 (A) Avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the property
35 of the adult; or
36 (B) obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the support,
37 care, education, health or welfare of the adult or an individual entitled to
38 the adult's support; and
39 (3) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a less
40 restrictive alternative.
41 (b) After the hearing on a petition under section 84, and amendments
42 thereto, for conservatorship for a minor or under section 119(c), and
43 amendments thereto, for a protective arrangement instead of

HB 2359 95
1 conservatorship for a minor, the court may issue an order under subsection
2 (c) for a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship for the
3 respondent if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
4 arrangement is in the minor's best interest, and:
5 (1) If the minor has a parent, the court gives weight to any
6 recommendation of the parent whether an arrangement is in the minor's
7 best interest;
8 (2) either:
9 (A) The minor owns money or property requiring management or
10 protection that otherwise cannot be provided;
11 (B) the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at
12 unreasonable risk or hindered because of the minor's age; or
13 (C) the arrangement is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide
14 funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health or
15 welfare of the minor; and
16 (3) the order under subsection (c) is necessary or desirable to obtain
17 or provide money needed for the support, care, education, health or
18 welfare of the minor.
19 (c) If the court makes the findings under subsection (a) or (b), the
20 court, instead of appointing a conservator, may:
21 (1) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to protect the financial
22 interest or property of the respondent, including:
23 (A) An action to establish eligibility for benefits;
24 (B) payment, delivery, deposit or retention of funds or property;
25 (C) sale, mortgage, lease or other transfer of property;
26 (D) purchase of an annuity;
27 (E) entry into a contractual relationship, including a contract to
28 provide for personal care, supportive services, education, training or
29 employment;
30 (F) addition to or establishment of a trust;
31 (G) ratification or invalidation of a contract, trust, will or other

33 affairs of the respondent; or
34 (H) settlement of a claim; or
35 (2) restrict access to the respondent's property by a specified person
36 whose access to the property places the respondent at serious risk of
37 financial harm.
38 (d) After the hearing on a petition under section 119(a)(2) or (c), and
39 amendments thereto, whether or not the court makes the findings under
40 subsection (a) or (b), the court may issue an order to restrict access to the
41 respondent or the respondent's property by a specified person that the court
42 finds by clear and convincing evidence:
43 (1) Through fraud, coercion, duress or the use of deception and

HB 2359 96
1 control caused or attempted to cause an action that would have resulted in
2 financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and
3 (2) poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the respondent
4 or the respondent's property.
5 (e) Before issuing an order under subsection (c) or (d), the court shall
6 consider the factors under section 99, and amendments thereto, a
7 conservator must consider when making a decision on behalf of an
8 individual subject to conservatorship.
9 (f) Before issuing an order under subsection (c) or (d) for a
10 respondent who is a minor, the court also shall consider the best interest of
11 the minor, the preference of the parents of the minor and the preference of
12 the minor, if the minor is 12 years of age or older.
13 (g) Any order issued under this section may include reporting
14 requirements, time limits, bond requirements or any other provisions
15 deemed necessary by the court.
16 New Sec. 122. A verified petition for a protective arrangement
17 instead of guardianship or conservatorship must state the petitioner's name,
18 principal residence, current street address, if different, relationship to the
19 respondent, interest in the protective arrangement, the name and address of
20 any attorney representing the petitioner and, to the extent known, the
21 following:

12 conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact so to act.
13 A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power of attorney
14 who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the power of
15 attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers conferred in the
16 best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing and conflicts of
17 interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the trustee's beneficiary
18 or beneficiaries. The attorney in fact shall keep a record of receipts,
19 disbursements and transactions made on behalf of the principal and shall
20 not comingle funds or assets of the principal with the funds or assets of the
21 attorney in fact. In the absence of explicit authorization, the attorney in
22 fact shall exercise a high degree of care in maintaining, without
23 modification, any estate plan which the principal may have in place,
24 including, but not limited to, arrangements made by the principal for
25 disposition of assets at death through beneficiary designations, ownership
26 by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, trust arrangements or by will or
27 codicil. Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney or in a separate
28 agreement between the principal and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact
29 who elects to act shall exercise the authority granted in a power of attorney
30 with that degree of care that would be observed by a prudent person
31 dealing with the property and conducting the affairs of another, except that
32 all investments made on or after July 1, 2003, shall be in accordance with
33 the provisions of the Kansas uniform prudent investor act, K.S.A. 58-
34 24a01 et seq., and amendments thereto. If the attorney in fact has special
35 skills or was appointed attorney in fact on the basis of representations of
36 special skills or expertise, the attorney in fact has a duty to use those skills
37 in the principal's behalf.
38 (b) On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's
39 behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances, an
40 attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the principal, to
41 communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow the instructions
42 of the principal.
43 (c) If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court of

HB 2359 118
1 the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, guardian of the estate or
2 other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's
3 property or all of the principal's property except specified exclusions, the
4 attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal.
5 The fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the durable power of
6 attorney that the principal would have had if the principal were not an
7 adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or conservator or both as
8 defined by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 59-3051 section 25, and amendments
9 thereto.
10 (d) A principal may nominate by a power of attorney, a guardian or
11 conservator, or both, for consideration by the court. If a petition to appoint
12 a guardian or conservator, or both, is filed, the court shall make the
13 appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination in
14 the power of attorney, so long as the individual nominated is a fit and
15 proper person.
16 (e) An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the
17 principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of
18 attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the principal's
19 legal representative or a court, and the oral and written instructions of the
20 principal, or the written instructions of the principal's legal representative
21 or a court.
22 (f) An attorney in fact may be instructed in a power of attorney that
23 the authority granted shall not be exercised until, or shall terminate on, the
24 happening of a future event, condition or contingency, as determined in a
25 manner prescribed in the instrument.
26 (g) On the death of the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow the
27 instructions of the court, if any, having jurisdiction over the estate of the
28 principal, or any part thereof, and shall communicate with and be
29 accountable to the principal's personal representative, or if none, the
30 principal's successors. The attorney in fact shall promptly deliver to and
31 put in the possession and control of the principal's personal representative
32 or successors, any property of the principal and copies of any records of
33 the attorney in fact relating to transactions undertaken in the principal's
34 behalf that are deemed by the personal representative or the court to be
35 necessary or helpful in the administration of the decedent's estate.
36 (h) If an attorney in fact has a property or contract interest in the
37 subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact is
38 otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the principal, this
39 section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact that would
40 conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.
41 Sec. 145. K.S.A. 58-662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 58-
42 662. (a) The principal may petition the court for an accounting by the
43 principal's attorney in fact or the legal representative of the attorney in

HB 2359 119
1 fact. If the principal is disabled or deceased, a petition for accounting may
2 be filed by the principal's legal representative, an adult member of the
3 principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the principal.
4 (b) Any requirement for an accounting may be waived or an
5 accounting may be approved by the court without hearing, if the
6 accounting is waived or approved by a principal who is not disabled, or by
7 a principal whose legal capacity has been restored, or by all creditors and
8 distributees of a deceased principal's estate whose claims or distributions
9 theretofore have not been satisfied in full. The approval or waiver shall be
10 in writing, signed by the affected persons and filed with the court.
11 (c) For the purposes of subsection (b), a legal representative or a
12 person providing services to the principal's estate shall not be considered a
13 creditor of the principal's estate. No express approval or waiver shall be
14 required from the legal representative of a disabled principal if the
15 principal's legal capacity has been restored, or from the personal
16 representative of a deceased principal's estate, or from any other person
17 entitled to compensation or expense for services rendered to a disabled or
18 deceased principal's estate, unless the principal or the principal's estate is
19 unable to pay in full the compensation and expense to which the person
20 rendering the services may be entitled.
21 (d) The principal, the principal's attorney in fact, an adult member of
22 the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
23 principal may petition the district court in the county where the principal is
24 then residing to determine and declare whether a principal, who has
25 executed a power of attorney, is a disabled person.
26 (e) If the principal is a disabled person, on petition of the principal's
27 legal representative, an adult member of the principal's family or any
28 interested person, including a person interested in the welfare of the
29 principal, for good cause shown, the court may:
30 (1) Order the attorney in fact to exercise or refrain from exercising
31 authority in a durable power of attorney in a particular manner or for a
32 particular purpose;
33 (2) modify the authority of an attorney in fact under a durable power
34 of attorney;
35 (3) declare suspended a power of attorney that is nondurable;
36 (4) terminate a durable power of attorney;
37 (5) remove the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;
38 (6) confirm the authority of an attorney in fact or a successor attorney
39 in fact to act under a durable power of attorney; and
40 (7) issue such other orders as the court finds will be in the best
41 interest of the disabled principal, including appointment of a conservator
42 for the principal pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050, et seq. the Kansas uniform
43 guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements act,

HB 2359 120
1 sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto.
2 (f) In addition to any other remedies available under law, if after
3 notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a showing that
4 the principal is a disabled person and that the attorney in fact has breached
5 such attorney in fact's fiduciary duty to the principal or that there is a
6 reasonable likelihood that such attorney in fact may do so in the immediate
7 future, the court, in its discretion, may issue an order that some or all of
8 the authority granted by the durable power of attorney be suspended or
9 modified, and that a different attorney in fact be authorized to exercise
10 some or all of the powers granted by the durable power of attorney. Such
11 attorney in fact may be designated by the court. The court may require any
12 person petitioning for any such order to file a bond in such amount and
13 with such sureties as required by the court to indemnify either the attorney
14 in fact who has been acting on behalf of the principal or the principal and
15 the principal's successors in interest for the expenses, including attorney
16 fees, incurred by any such persons with respect to such proceeding. The
17 court, after hearing, may allow payment or enter judgment. None of the
18 actions described in this subsection shall be taken by the court until after
19 hearing upon reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified
20 statement supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action
21 identifying the immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons
22 known to the petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal.
23 Except that in the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the
24 court, without notice, may enter such temporary order as seems proper to
25 the court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than 30
26 days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to the
27 persons identified as herein provided in this subsection.
28 (g) If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court or
29 the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an
30 accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property
31 belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the
32 attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a
33 successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.
34 (h) In a proceeding under this act or in any other proceeding, or upon
35 petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:
36 (1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a power of attorney to
37 account;
38 (2) authorize the attorney in fact under a power of attorney to enter
39 into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any
40 transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is, was
41 or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power to
42 authorize for a conservator pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050 et seq. the Kansas
43 uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective arrangements

HB 2359 121
1 act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto; and
2 (3) relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise authority
3 for a disabled principal under a durable power of attorney.
4 (i) Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation,
5 any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach of
6 duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has received
7 an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter unless a
8 proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within two years
9 after receipt of the account or statement by the principal or, if the principal
10 is a disabled person, by a guardian or conservator of the disabled person's
11 estate. If a disabled person has no guardian or conservator of the disabled
12 person's estate at the time an account or statement is presented, then the
13 cause of action shall not be barred until one year after the removal of the
14 principal's disability or incapacity, one year after the appointment of a
15 conservator for the principal or one year after the death of the principal.
16 The cause of action thus barred does not include any action to recover
17 from an attorney in fact or successor for fraud, misrepresentation or
18 concealment related to the settlement of any transaction involving the
19 agency relationship of the attorney in fact with the principal.

42 discharged, the head of the treatment facility shall promptly inform the

19 order of continuance, for good cause shown, to any party for no longer
20 than seven days, except that such limitation does not apply to a request for
21 an order of continuance made by the proposed patient or to a request made
22 by any party if the proposed patient is absent such that further proceedings
23 can not be held until the proposed patient has been located. The court also,
24 upon the request of any party, may advance the date of the hearing if
25 necessary and in the best interests of all concerned.
