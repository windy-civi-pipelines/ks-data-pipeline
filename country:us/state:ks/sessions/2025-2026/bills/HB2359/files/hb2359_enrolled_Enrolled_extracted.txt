guardian without notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a
represented minor, notice of the appointment must be given not later

subsection (c). Not later than seven days after the appointment, the

minor.

only if:
(a) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by
the minor equals $25,000 or less;

pending such notification.

terminates:
(1) On the minor's death, adoption, emancipation or attainment of
majority; or
(2) when the court finds that the standard in section 51, and
amendments thereto, for appointment of a guardian is not satisfied,
unless the court finds that:
(A) Termination of the guardianship would be harmful to the

outweighs the interest of any parent of the minor in restoration of the
parent's right to make decisions for the minor.

plan is consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under sections
59 and 60, and amendments thereto. The court may not approve the
plan until 30 days after the filing.
(e) After the guardian's plan filed under this section is approved
by the court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the minor
if the minor is 12 years of age or older, to any attorney representing the
minor in the guardianship proceeding or any other proceeding
concerning the care or custody of the minor identified in the petition, to

court may:
(1) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and

limitations of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage

independence. The court may not establish a full guardianship if a
limited guardianship, protective arrangement instead of guardianship or
other less restrictive alternatives would meet the needs of the
respondent.

knowledge of that prior representation or to an attorney whom the
respondent has requested. Any appointment made by the court shall
terminate after the guardian's plan has been approved and after any

hearing support a prima facie case of the need for a guardian, the court
shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
mental health center, community developmental disability organization
or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician
assistant, nurse practitioner, social worker or other professional

opinion with regard to the issues of whether or not the respondent is in
need of a guardian and whether there are barriers to the respondent's
attendance and participation at the hearing on the petition; and
(9) the signature of the professional who prepared the report.
(c) The professional shall file with the court, at least five days
prior to the date of the trial, such professional's written report
concerning the examination and evaluation ordered by the court. The

(d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation
as provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of
this section and that no further examination or evaluation should be
required, unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such
an examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be
filed with the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at
least four days prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request

hearing at an alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow
the respondent to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual
technology.
(b) A hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may
proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
and convincing evidence that:
(1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after
having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential
consequences of failing to do so; or
(2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services and
technological assistance.
(c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 66,
and amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's
choosing, assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a
combination of these supports. If assistance would facilitate the
respondent's participation in the hearing, but is not otherwise available
to the respondent, the court shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
(d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
respondent at a hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto.

conditions on the person's participation.
New Sec. 71. (a) The existence of a proceeding for or the

this subsection for good cause may request permission from the court
for access to court records of the guardianship, including the guardian's
report and plan. The court shall grant access if access is in the best
interest of the respondent or adult subject to guardianship or furthers
the public interest and does not endanger the welfare or financial
interests of the adult.

liaison or a professional evaluation under section 69, and amendments
thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

(5) any other person if it is in the public interest or for a purpose
the court orders for good cause.
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 34

other close family member of the respondent.
(b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection
(a), the court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best
qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall
consider the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's
skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the
person and the respondent have similar values and preferences and the
likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian
successfully.
(c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
decline to appoint as guardian a person having priority under
subsection (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no
priority.
(d) In determining whether the appointment of a proposed
guardian is in the best interest of the respondent, the court shall
consider the number of other cases in which the proposed guardian,
other than a corporation, is currently serving as guardian, particularly if
that number is more than 15.
(e) The following persons shall not be appointed as guardian
unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person

New Sec. 73. (a) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult
must:
(1) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by
a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less
restrictive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services,
technological assistance or supported decision making; and
(2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on
the petition.
(b) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must
state the basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific
findings that support the conclusion that a limited guardianship would
not meet the functional needs of the adult subject to guardianship.
(c) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 35
must state the specific powers granted to the guardian.
(d) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult must include

guardian appointed under section 72, and amendments thereto, shall

under section 66, and amendments thereto, a copy of the order of

thereto, or a subsequent order a statement of the rights of the adult
subject to guardianship and procedures to seek relief if the adult is
denied those rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, in
plain language and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the
adult subject to guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify

in these matters;

facility or other facility that places restrictions on the individual's

in the guardian's plan under section 79, and amendments thereto, or
authorized by the court by specific order;
(6) object to a change or move described in paragraph (5) and the
process for objecting;
(7) communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
visitors, and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or

order to restrict communications, visits or interactions;
(B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of
guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a
person; or
(C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult, and the
restriction is:
(i) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
(ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not
have a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult;

New Sec. 75. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under

Section 18:
section 65, and amendments thereto, or on verified petition by a person
interested in an adult's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
guardian for the adult if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
establish probable cause that:
(1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
imminent and substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety or
welfare;
(2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
circumstances; and
(3) a basis for appointment of a guardian under section 64, and
amendments thereto, exists.
(b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an
adult may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may
exercise only the powers specified in the order of appointment. The
emergency guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for
not more than 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and
that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in
subsection (a) continue.
(c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an
emergency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to
represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise
provided in subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time, and
place of a hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the
respondent's attorney and any other person the court determines.
(d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult
without notice to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the
court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physical
health, safety or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing
with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an
emergency guardian without giving notice under subsection (c), the
court must:
(1) Give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 37
appointment to:
(A) The respondent;
(B) the respondent's attorney; and
(C) any other person the court determines; and
(2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not
later than five days after the appointment.
(e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is
not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian
under section 64, and amendments thereto.
(f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report
the court requires.
New Sec. 76. (a) A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary. A guardian
shall strive to assure that the personal, civil and human rights of the
individual subject to guardianship are protected. Except as otherwise
limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions
regarding the support, care, education, health and welfare of the adult
subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's
limitations and in accordance with the guardian's plan under section 79,
and amendments thereto.
(b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of
the adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, include the adult in
decision making, and encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act
on the adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage
the adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian
shall:
(1) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and
maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular
visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities
and physical and mental health;
(2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and
preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the
adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities or
social interactions; and
(3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive
relationships and services for the adult.
(c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable
care, diligence and prudence when acting on behalf of or making
decisions for the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
(1) Take reasonable care of the personal effects and service or
support animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a
conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if
necessary to protect the adult's property;
(2) if authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
thereto, expend funds and other property of the adult received by the
guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education,
health and welfare;
(3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not
expended under paragraph (2) for the adult's future needs, but if a
conservator has been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other
property at least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the
adult's future needs; and
(4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care
services, provided to the adult.
(d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the
adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would
unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 38
guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's
previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, cultural practices,
religious beliefs, values and actions, to the extent actually known or
reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
(e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under
subsection (d) because the guardian does not know and cannot
reasonably determine the decision the adult probably would make if
able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would
make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or
financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with
the best interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the
adult, the guardian shall consider:
(1) Information received from professionals and persons that
demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;
(2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have
considered if the adult were able to act; and
(3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the
adult would consider, including consequences for others.
(f) A guardian for an adult shall notify the court immediately if the
condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of
exercising rights previously removed.
New Sec. 77. (a) Except as limited by court order, a guardian for
an adult may:
(1) If authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application
or receipt is within the powers of the conservator;
(2) establish the adult's place of dwelling;
(3) consent to health, including mental health, or other care,
treatment or service for the adult;
(4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed,
commence a proceeding including an administrative proceeding, or
take other appropriate action to compel another person to support the
adult or pay funds for the adult's benefit; and
(5) receive personally identifiable healthcare information
regarding the adult.
(b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an
adult to consent to the adoption of the adult.
(c) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an
adult to litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce,
dissolution or annulment of marriage of the individual subject to
guardianship, including negotiation of a settlement thereof.
(d) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection
(b) or (c), the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be
in accordance with the adult's preferences, values and prior directions
and whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.
(e) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(2) to
establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:
(1) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult
would select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-
making standard in section 76(d) and (e), and amendments thereto. If
the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine what
setting the adult subject to guardianship probably would choose if able,
or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would make
would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or
financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance
with section 76(e), and amendments thereto, a residential setting that is
consistent with the adult's best interest;
(2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 39
residential setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with
persons important to the adult and meet the adult's needs in the least
restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 76(d) and (e),
and amendments thereto;
(3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the
adult:
(A) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult and any
person identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing

dwelling and state whether the adult received advance notice of the
change and whether the adult objected to the change;

to a nursing home, mental health facility or other facility that places
restrictions on the adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
(A) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under

Section 19:
section 79, and amendments thereto;
(B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or
(C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at least
14 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons
entitled to notice under section 73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a
subsequent order, and no objection is filed;
(5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside
this state only if consistent with the guardian's plan and authorized by
the court by specific order; and
(6) take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the
lease to the primary dwelling of the adult only if:
(A) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan under

Section 20:
section 79, and amendments thereto;
(B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or
(C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the
action to the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under section
73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order and no
objection has been filed.
(f) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(3) to
make healthcare decisions, the guardian shall:
(1) Involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably
feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting
the adult in understanding the risks and benefits of healthcare options;
(2) act in accordance with any declaration of the adult made
pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109, and
amendments thereto; and
(3) take into account:
(A) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
(B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult, if
known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
New Sec. 78. (a) A guardian for an adult shall not initiate the
commitment of the adult to a mental health facility except in
accordance with the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons,
K.S.A. 59-2945 et seq., and amendments thereto.
(b) A guardian for an adult shall not restrict the ability of the adult
to communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
visitors and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or
electronic communications, including through social media, or
participating in social activities, unless:
(1) Authorized by the court by specific order;
(2) a protective order or a protective arrangement instead of
guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 40
person; or
(3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult and the restriction
is:
(A) For a period of not more than seven business days if the
person has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
(B) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not
have a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult.
(c) A guardian for an adult shall not consent, on behalf of the
adult, to:
(1) Any psychosurgery, removal of any bodily organ or

when necessary to preserve the life of the adult or to prevent serious
and irreparable impairment to the physical health of the adult;
(2) the sterilization of the adult, unless approved by the court
following a due process hearing held for the purposes of determining

procedure on the adult, or for the adult to be a participant in any

regulations do not apply, then by a review committee established by the
agency, institution or treatment facility at which the procedure or
experiment is proposed to occur, composed of members selected for the
purposes of determining whether the proposed procedure or
experiment:
(A) Does not involve any significant risk of harm to the physical
or mental health of the adult, or the use of aversive stimulants, and is
intended to preserve the life or health of the adult or to assist the adult
to develop or regain skills or abilities; or
(B) involves a significant risk of harm to the physical or mental
health of the adult, or the use of an aversive stimulant, but that the
conducting of the proposed procedure or experiment is intended either
to preserve the life of the adult, or to significantly improve the quality
of life of the adult, or to assist the adult to develop or regain significant
skills or abilities, and that the guardian has been fully informed
concerning the potential risks and benefits of the proposed procedure or
experiment or of any aversive stimulant proposed to be used, and as to
how and under what circumstances the aversive stimulant may be used,
and has specifically consented to such;
(4) the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-sustaining
medical care, treatment, services or procedures, except:
(A) In accordance with the provisions of any declaration of the
adult made pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-
28,109, and amendments thereto;
(B) if the adult, prior to the court's appointment of a guardian, has
executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions pursuant
to K.S.A. 58-625, et seq., and amendments thereto, and that durable
power of attorney has not previously been revoked by the adult, and it
includes any provision relevant to the withholding or withdrawal of
life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
procedures, then the guardian shall act as provided for in that power of
attorney, even if the guardian has revoked or amended that power of
attorney pursuant to the authority of K.S.A. 58-627, and amendments
thereto; or
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 41
(C) in accordance with subsection (d) or (e).
(d) (1) It shall be presumed that every adult under guardianship
has directed such adult's guardian to direct the adult's healthcare
providers to provide such adult with nutrition or hydration or both to a
degree that is sufficient to sustain life. No court, guardian or any person
shall have the authority to make a decision on behalf of an adult who is
legally incapable of making healthcare decisions to withhold or
withdraw nutrition or hydration or both from such adult except if:
(A) The adult, when legally capable of making healthcare
decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawal of
nutrition or hydration or both under the adult's current circumstances.
Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a declaration or a
durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions described in
subsection (c)(4); or
(B) the adult's treating physician certifies in writing that, in the
physician's reasonable medical judgment:
(i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
would hasten death; or
(ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not contribute
to sustaining the adult's life.
(2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawing nutrition or hydration
or both under paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with the court
with the written certification from the adult's treating physician.
(B) Notice of such filing shall be provided to the adult subject to
guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
guardianship and any other person whom the court determines at the
time of filing of the petition.
(C) The court shall appoint an attorney for the adult. The court
may request that the state protection and advocacy agency as provided
by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments thereto, or 42
U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e, represent the
adult.

thereafter as the court is available.
(E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawing
nutrition or hydration or both unless the court finds by clear and
convincing evidence that:
(i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
would hasten death; or
(ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not contribute
to sustaining the adult's life.
(3) (A) A cause of action for injunctive relief may be maintained:
(i) Against any person who is reasonably believed to be about to
violate or who is in the course of violating this subsection; or
(ii) to secure a court determination, notwithstanding the position
of a guardian, that the adult legally incapable of making healthcare
decisions, when legally capable of making such decisions, executed
expressly and with informed consent, a written directive to withdraw or
withhold hydration or nutrition or both in the applicable circumstances.
Such written directive shall be presumed valid unless there is clear and
convincing evidence to the contrary.
(B) The action may be brought by any person who is:
(i) The spouse, parent, child or sibling of the adult;
(ii) a current healthcare provider of the adult;
(iii) the guardian of the adult;
(iv) the state protection and advocacy agency as provided by
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 42
K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments thereto, or 42
U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e; or
(v) a public official with appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the
laws of this state.
(C) Pending the final determination of the court, the court shall
direct that nutrition or hydration or both be provided to such adult
unless the court determines that paragraph (3)(A) is applicable.
(e) (1) No court, guardian or any person shall have the authority to
make a decision on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of
making healthcare decisions to withhold or withdraw life-saving or
life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures from

decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawing of
life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
procedures from such adult under the adult's current circumstances.
Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a declaration or a
durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions described in
subsection (c)(4); or
(B) (i) The adult's treating physician certifies in writing to the
guardian that the adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong the
dying process; and
(ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or by
any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's order
that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-saving or
life-sustaining medical care.
(2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures under
paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with the court with the written

U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e, represent the
adult.
(D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
thereafter as the court is available.
(E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawal of
life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
procedures unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
that:
(i) The adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong the
dying process; and
(ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or by
any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's order
that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-saving or
life-sustaining medical care.

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 43
authority over the adult's estate, unless specifically authorized by the
court. Any guardian who is granted such authority shall prepare an

104, and amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to
the guardian and may waive the requirement of the posting of a bond,
only if:
(1) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by
the adult equals $25,000 or less; and
(2) either the court requires the guardian to report to the court the
commencement of the exercising of such authority, or requires the
guardian to obtain court authorization to commence the exercise of
such authority, as the court shall specify; and
(3) the court also requires the guardian, whenever the combined
value of such funds and property exceeds $25,000, to:
(A) File a guardian's plan as provided for in section 79, and
amendments thereto, that contains elements similar to those that would
be contained in a conservator's plan as provided for in section 103, and
amendments thereto;
(B) petition the court for appointment of a conservator; or
(C) notify the court as the court shall specify that the value of the
adult's estate has equaled or exceeded $25,000, if the court has earlier
appointed a conservator but did not issue letters of conservatorship
pending such notification;
(g) A guardian for an adult shall not access digital assets of the
adult unless authorized by the court pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 58-
4814, and amendments thereto.

object to the plan in writing no later than 21 days after the filing.
(d) The court shall review the guardian's plan filed under
subsection (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a
new plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall
consider an objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is
consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under sections 76 and
77, and amendments thereto. The court shall review an initial
guardian's plan at the review hearing scheduled under section 73(b),
and amendments thereto. When reviewing subsequent guardian's plans,

guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and
amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the
court determines.

preferences, values, prior directions and best interest;
(8) anything of more than de minimis value which the guardian,
any individual who resides with the guardian, or the spouse, parent,
child or sibling of the guardian has received from an individual
providing goods or services to the adult;
(9) any circumstance that may constitute a conflict of interest
between the guardian and the adult. A conflict of interest occurs where

adult's estate to equal or exceed $25,000;
(5) the death of the adult; or
(6) a change in the circumstances of the guardian or the adult that

services available to the adult have changed;
(3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that

(c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers
necessitated by demonstrated limitations and needs of the adult and

individual who is in fact dependent on the respondent. The court may
appoint an emergency conservator to assist in implementing the order.
New Sec. 87. (a) If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a
conservator is a minor, the court may appoint a court liaison to
investigate a matter related to the petition or inform the minor or a
parent of the minor about the petition or a related matter.
(b) If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a conservator is an
adult, the court may appoint a court liaison. The duties and reporting
requirements of the court liaison are limited to the relief requested in
the petition. The court liaison must be an individual with training or

petition.
(c) (1) A court liaison appointed under subsection (b) for an adult

the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the
conservator's proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of

substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to
inform the respondent of the respondent's rights and the nature and
purpose of the proceeding.

respondent in other matters if the court has knowledge of that prior
representation or to an attorney whom the respondent has requested.
Any appointment made by the court shall terminate after the
conservator's plan has been approved and after any appeal from the
appointment of a conservator, unless the court continues the
appointment by further order. Thereafter, an attorney may be appointed
by the court if requested, in writing, by the adult subject to
conservatorship, the conservator or upon the court's own motion.

amendments thereto, if the court determines the parent needs
representation.
New Sec. 89. (a) Upon the filing of the petition or any other time
at or before the hearing, if the contents of the petition or evidence at the
hearing support a prima facie case of the need for a conservator, the
court shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
mental health center or community developmental disability
organization, or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist,
physician assistant, nurse practitioner, social worker or other

personally completed an independent examination and evaluation of the
respondent, and that the report submitted to the court contains the
results of that examination and evaluation, and the professional's
opinion with regard to the issues of whether or not the respondent is in
need of a conservator and whether there are barriers to the respondent's
attendance and participation at the hearing on the petition; and
(8) the signature of the professional who prepared the report.
(c) The professional shall file with the court, at least five days
prior to the date of the trial, such professional's written report
concerning the examination and evaluation ordered by the court. The
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 53
report shall be made available by the court to counsel for all parties.
(d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation
as provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of
this section and that no further examination or evaluation should be
required, unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such
an examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be
filed with the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at
least four days prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request
shall be a statement of the reasons why an examination and evaluation
is requested and the name and address of a qualified professional or

New Sec. 90. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may not proceed
unless the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible
for the respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings
typically are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the
hearing at an alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow
the respondent to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual
technology.
(b) A hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may
proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
and convincing evidence that:
(1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after
having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential
consequences of failing to do so;
(2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services or
technological assistance; or
(3) the respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and
attendance would be harmful to the minor.
(c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 85,
and amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's
choosing, assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a
combination of these supports. If assistance would facilitate the
respondent's participation in the hearing, but is not otherwise available
to the respondent, the court shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.

respondent at a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto.

respondent will be served. The court may impose appropriate
conditions on the person's participation.

liaison or professional evaluation under section 89, and amendments
thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

best qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall
consider the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's
skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the
person and the respondent have similar values and preferences and the
likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a conservator
successfully.
(c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may

established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on

Section 30:
section 84, and amendments thereto, or on a verified petition by a
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 57
person interested in an individual's welfare, the court may appoint an

New Sec. 97. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),
the court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety, or
require an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on
faithful discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive
the requirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-
protection arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the
individual subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (c), the court may not waive the requirement if the
conservator is in the business of serving as a conservator and is being
paid for the conservator's service.
(b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this

Section 31:
section must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the
conservatorship estate, plus one year's estimated income, less the value
of property deposited under an arrangement requiring a court order for
its removal, and less the value of real property. The court, in place of
surety on a bond, may accept collateral for the performance of the
bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of real property.
(c) A regulated financial-service institution qualified to do trust
business in this state is not required to give a bond under this section.

(1) Except as otherwise provided by the bond, the surety and the
conservator are jointly and severally liable.
(2) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety
submits to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of
office to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the
conservator in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the
proceeding must be given to the surety at the address shown in the
records of the court in which the bond is filed and any other address of
the surety then known to the person required to provide the notice.
(3) On petition of a successor conservator or person affected by a

under the bond is exhausted.
(b) A proceeding may not be brought under this section against a
surety of a bond on a matter as to which a proceeding against the
conservator is barred.

individual's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage
the individual's personal affairs. A conservator shall strive to assure that
the personal, civil and human rights of the individual subject to
conservatorship are protected.
(c) In making a decision for an individual subject to
conservatorship, the conservator shall make the decision that the
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 59
conservator reasonably believes the individual would make if able,
unless doing so would fail to preserve the resources needed to maintain
the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably
harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the
individual. To determine the decision the individual would make if
able, the conservator shall consider the individual's prior or current
directions, preferences, opinions, values and actions, to the extent
actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator.
(d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (c)
because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably
determine the decision the individual subject to conservatorship
probably would make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the
decision the individual would make would fail to preserve resources
needed to maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or
otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or
financial interests of the individual, the conservator shall act in
accordance with the best interest of the individual. In determining the
best interest of the individual, the conservator shall consider:
(1) Information received from professionals and persons that
demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the individual;

of the conservatorship estate is determined in light of the facts and
circumstances existing when the conservator decides or acts and not by
hindsight.
(g) A conservator shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts
relevant to the investment and management of the conservatorship
estate.
(h) A conservator that has special skills or expertise, or is named
conservator in reliance on the conservator's representation of special
skills or expertise, has a duty to use the special skills or expertise in
carrying out the conservator's duties.
(i) In investing, selecting specific property for distribution, and
invoking a power of revocation or withdrawal for the use or benefit of
the individual subject to conservatorship, a conservator shall consider
any estate plan of the individual known or reasonably ascertainable to
the conservator and may examine the will or other donative, nominative
or appointive instrument of the individual.
(j) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 60
and personal property of the individual subject to conservatorship,
unless the conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for
insurance or the court finds:

(2) insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the
conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the
individual.

of the individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided by
the revised uniform fiduciary access to digital assets act or court order.
(l) A conservator for an adult shall notify the court immediately if
the condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of
exercising rights previously removed.

New Sec. 101. Except as otherwise provided in section 102, and
amendments thereto, or as qualified or limited in the court's order of
appointment and stated in the letters of office, and unless contrary to a
conservator's plan under section 103, and amendments thereto, the

conservatorship estate without specific court authorization or
confirmation for the support, care, education, health or welfare of the
individual subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact
dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship, including the
payment of child or spousal support, in accordance with the following
rules:
(a) The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to
the appropriate standard of support, care, education, health, or welfare

conservatorship pursuant to K.S.A. 58a-411 or 58a-602, and

conservator's plan, a conservator shall file with the court a plan for
protecting, managing, expending and distributing the assets of the
conservatorship estate. The plan must be based on the needs of the
individual subject to conservatorship and take into account the best
interest of the individual as well as the individual's preferences, values
and prior directions, to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable
by the conservator. The conservator shall include in the plan:
(1) A budget containing projected expenses and resources,

entitled under subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the
conservator's plan may object to the plan in writing not later than 21
days after the filing.
(d) The court shall review the conservator's plan filed under
subsection (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a
new plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall

review an initial conservator's plan at the review hearing scheduled
under section 93(e), and amendments thereto. For subsequent
conservator's plans, the court has discretion whether to set the matter
for hearing but may not approve the plan until 30 days after the filing.
(e) After a conservator's plan under this section is approved by the
court, the conservator shall provide a copy of the plan to the individual
subject to conservatorship, any attorney representing the individual
subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section
93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other
person the court determines.

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 65
(1) An accounting that lists property included in the
conservatorship estate and the receipts, disbursements, liabilities and
distributions during the period for which the report is made;
(2) a list of the services provided to the individual subject to
conservatorship;
(3) a statement whether the conservator has deviated from the
conservator's most recently approved plan and, if so, how the

and any recommended change in the scope of the conservatorship;

available financial statements evidencing the status of bank accounts,

appointed to serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to
serve; and
(9) a copy of the bond renewal.
(c) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report under
this section or conservator's plan under section 103, and amendments
thereto, interview the individual subject to conservatorship or
conservator, or investigate any other matter involving the
conservatorship. In connection with the report, the court may order the
conservator to submit the conservatorship estate to appropriate
examination in a manner the court directs.
(d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report,
together with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual
subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section
93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and other
persons the court determines. The notice and report must be given not
later than 14 days after filing.
(e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to
determine whether:
(1) The reports provide sufficient information to establish the
conservator has complied with the conservator's duties;
(2) the conservatorship should continue; and
(3) the conservator's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
(f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator
has not complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship
should not continue, the court:
(1) Shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the
conservator and any other person entitled to notice under section 93(f),
and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order;
(2) may require additional information from the conservator;
(3) may appoint a court liaison to interview the individual subject
to conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving
the conservatorship; and
(4) consistent with sections 112 and 113, and amendments thereto,
may hold a hearing to consider removal of the conservator, termination
of the conservatorship or a change in the powers granted to the
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 66
conservator or terms of the conservatorship.
(g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a
conservator are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine whether to adjust the requested fees.
(h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report
filed under this section. The court after review may approve the report.
If the court approves the report, there is a rebuttable presumption the
report is accurate as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
(i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report
of a conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities
concerning a matter adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person
given notice of the report or accounting.
(j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report
filed under this section discharges the conservator from all liabilities,
claims and causes of action by a person given notice of the report and
the hearing as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
New Sec. 106. (a) The interest of an individual subject to
conservatorship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not
transferrable or assignable by the individual and is not subject to levy,
garnishment, or similar process for claims against the individual unless
allowed under section 110, and amendments thereto.
(b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a
contract after having the right to enter the contract removed by the
court, the contract is void against the individual and the individual's
property but is enforceable against the person that contracted with the
individual.
(c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an
individual subject to conservatorship with respect to property included
in the conservatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of
this state other than this act.
New Sec. 107. A transaction involving a conservatorship estate
which is affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's
fiduciary duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction
is authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice
under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order. A
transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale,
encumbrance or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate
entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the
conservator resides, the spouse, descendant, sibling, agent or attorney
of the conservator, or a corporation or other enterprise in which the
conservator has a substantial beneficial interest.
New Sec. 108. (a) A person that assists or deals with a conservator
in good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction
requiring a court order under section 102, and amendments thereto, is
protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in
question. Knowledge alone by a person that the person is dealing with a
conservator does not require the person to inquire into the existence of
authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's
exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of
office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A
person that pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible
for proper application of the property.
(b) Protection under subsection (a) extends to a procedural
irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the
issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a
person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable
provisions in law of this state other than this act relating to a
commercial transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a
fiduciary.
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 67
New Sec. 109. (a) If an individual subject to conservatorship dies,
the conservator shall deliver to the district court any will of the
individual that is in the conservator's possession and inform the
personal representative named in the will if feasible. The conservator
shall give notice of the delivery of the will under this section to any
person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and amendments thereto,
or a subsequent order.
(b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship
estate as provided in section 113, and amendments thereto.
New Sec. 110. (a) A conservator may pay a claim against the
conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship
arising before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and
allowance in accordance with the priorities under subsection (d). A
claimant may present a claim by:
(1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a
record of the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the
claimant and the amount claimed; or
(2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the
court, and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
(b) A claim under subsection (a) is presented on receipt by the
conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of
the claim, whichever occurs first. A presented claim is allowed, if it is
not disallowed in whole or in part, by the conservator in a record sent
or delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation.
Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim
to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a
court order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a
claim tolls until 30 days after disallowance of the claim the running of a
statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.
(c) A claimant whose claim under subsection (a) has not been paid
may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is
barred by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance,
payment or security by encumbering property included in the
conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual
subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator
or is initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator
notice of the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the

and amendments thereto.

fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property
included in the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course
of administration of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against
the conservatorship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a
fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable
for the claim.

conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for
accounting, surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate
proceeding or action.

(1) Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship,
conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which

based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during the
preceding six months;
(2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which

extent of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other
good cause.

modification of the conservatorship may be appropriate, including
because the functional needs of the individual or supports or services
available to the individual have changed;
(3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
needs or supports or services available to the individual have changed
or a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less
restrictive alternative is available; or
(4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
interest of the individual.
(e) Notice of a petition under subsection (c) or of a hearing under
this section must be given to the individual subject to conservatorship,

(k) On termination of a conservatorship by reason of the death of
the individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator promptly
shall file a final report and petition for discharge on approval by the
court of the final report. On approval of the final report, the conservator
shall proceed expeditiously to distribute the conservatorship estate to
the individual's estate or as otherwise ordered by the court. The
conservator may take reasonable measures necessary to preserve the
conservatorship estate until distribution can be made.
(l) The court shall issue a final order of discharge on the approval

(2) the plan approved by the court adequately provides for
meeting the expected needs of the minor from the minor's 18th birthday
until the final distribution of the funds or assets which the court
authorizes to be set aside or transferred from the estate are paid over to
the minor, including provisions for accelerated distribution in
extraordinary circumstances, which may require court approval.
(e) If the court orders a conservatorship for a minor to be extended

amount of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested in
a minor, shall have the discretion to order the payment of the money to
any person, including the parent of the minor, or the minor. If the
person is the conservator for the minor, the court may waive or

restrictive alternative.

obtain or provide money needed for the support, care, education, health
or welfare of the minor.

court, instead of appointing a conservator, may:
(1) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to protect the

control caused or attempted to cause an action that would have resulted
in financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and
(2) poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the
respondent or the respondent's property.
(e) Before issuing an order under subsection (c) or (d), the court
shall consider the factors under section 99, and amendments thereto, a
conservator must consider when making a decision on behalf of an
individual subject to conservatorship.

of attorney is under a duty to act in the interest of the principal and to
avoid conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact
so to act. A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power
of attorney who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the
power of attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers
conferred in the best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing
and conflicts of interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the
trustee's beneficiary or beneficiaries. The attorney in fact shall keep a
record of receipts, disbursements and transactions made on behalf of
the principal and shall not comingle funds or assets of the principal
with the funds or assets of the attorney in fact. In the absence of explicit
authorization, the attorney in fact shall exercise a high degree of care in
maintaining, without modification, any estate plan which the principal
may have in place, including, but not limited to, arrangements made by
the principal for disposition of assets at death through beneficiary
designations, ownership by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety,
trust arrangements or by will or codicil. Unless otherwise provided in
the power of attorney or in a separate agreement between the principal
and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact who elects to act shall exercise
the authority granted in a power of attorney with that degree of care
that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with the property
and conducting the affairs of another, except that all investments made
on or after July 1, 2003, shall be in accordance with the provisions of
the Kansas uniform prudent investor act, K.S.A. 58-24a01 et seq., and
amendments thereto. If the attorney in fact has special skills or was
appointed attorney in fact on the basis of representations of special
skills or expertise, the attorney in fact has a duty to use those skills in
the principal's behalf.
(b) On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's
behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances,
an attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the
principal, to communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow
the instructions of the principal.
(c) If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court
of the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, guardian of the estate
or other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's
property or all of the principal's property except specified exclusions,
the attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the
principal. The fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the
durable power of attorney that the principal would have had if the
principal were not an adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or
conservator or both as defined by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 59-3051

Section 46:
section 25, and amendments thereto.
(d) A principal may nominate by a power of attorney, a guardian
or conservator, or both, for consideration by the court. If a petition to
appoint a guardian or conservator, or both, is filed, the court shall make
the appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent
nomination in the power of attorney, so long as the individual
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 91
nominated is a fit and proper person.
(e) An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the
principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of
attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the
principal's legal representative or a court, and the oral and written
instructions of the principal, or the written instructions of the principal's
legal representative or a court.
(f) An attorney in fact may be instructed in a power of attorney
that the authority granted shall not be exercised until, or shall terminate
on, the happening of a future event, condition or contingency, as
determined in a manner prescribed in the instrument.
(g) On the death of the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow
the instructions of the court, if any, having jurisdiction over the estate
of the principal, or any part thereof, and shall communicate with and be
accountable to the principal's personal representative, or if none, the
principal's successors. The attorney in fact shall promptly deliver to and
put in the possession and control of the principal's personal
representative or successors, any property of the principal and copies of
any records of the attorney in fact relating to transactions undertaken in
the principal's behalf that are deemed by the personal representative or
the court to be necessary or helpful in the administration of the
decedent's estate.
(h) If an attorney in fact has a property or contract interest in the
subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact
is otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the
principal, this section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact
that would conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.
Sec. 145. K.S.A. 58-662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 58-

Section 47:
662. (a) The principal may petition the court for an accounting by the

fact. If the principal is disabled or deceased, a petition for accounting
may be filed by the principal's legal representative, an adult member of
the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
principal.
(b) Any requirement for an accounting may be waived or an
accounting may be approved by the court without hearing, if the
accounting is waived or approved by a principal who is not disabled, or
by a principal whose legal capacity has been restored, or by all
creditors and distributees of a deceased principal's estate whose claims
or distributions theretofore have not been satisfied in full. The approval
or waiver shall be in writing, signed by the affected persons and filed
with the court.
(c) For the purposes of subsection (b), a legal representative or a
person providing services to the principal's estate shall not be
considered a creditor of the principal's estate. No express approval or
waiver shall be required from the legal representative of a disabled
principal if the principal's legal capacity has been restored, or from the
personal representative of a deceased principal's estate, or from any
other person entitled to compensation or expense for services rendered
to a disabled or deceased principal's estate, unless the principal or the
principal's estate is unable to pay in full the compensation and expense
to which the person rendering the services may be entitled.
(d) The principal, the principal's attorney in fact, an adult member
of the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
principal may petition the district court in the county where the
principal is then residing to determine and declare whether a principal,
who has executed a power of attorney, is a disabled person.
(e) If the principal is a disabled person, on petition of the
principal's legal representative, an adult member of the principal's
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 92
family or any interested person, including a person interested in the
welfare of the principal, for good cause shown, the court may:
(1) Order the attorney in fact to exercise or refrain from exercising
authority in a durable power of attorney in a particular manner or for a
particular purpose;
(2) modify the authority of an attorney in fact under a durable
power of attorney;
(3) declare suspended a power of attorney that is nondurable;
(4) terminate a durable power of attorney;
(5) remove the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;
(6) confirm the authority of an attorney in fact or a successor
attorney in fact to act under a durable power of attorney; and
(7) issue such other orders as the court finds will be in the best
interest of the disabled principal, including appointment of a
conservator for the principal pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050, et seq. the
Kansas uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective
arrangements act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto.
(f) In addition to any other remedies available under law, if after
notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a showing
that the principal is a disabled person and that the attorney in fact has
breached such attorney in fact's fiduciary duty to the principal or that
there is a reasonable likelihood that such attorney in fact may do so in
the immediate future, the court, in its discretion, may issue an order that
some or all of the authority granted by the durable power of attorney be
suspended or modified, and that a different attorney in fact be
authorized to exercise some or all of the powers granted by the durable
power of attorney. Such attorney in fact may be designated by the
court. The court may require any person petitioning for any such order
to file a bond in such amount and with such sureties as required by the
court to indemnify either the attorney in fact who has been acting on
behalf of the principal or the principal and the principal's successors in
interest for the expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by any such
persons with respect to such proceeding. The court, after hearing, may
allow payment or enter judgment. None of the actions described in this
subsection shall be taken by the court until after hearing upon
reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified statement
supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action identifying the
immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons known to the
petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal. Except that in
the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the court,
without notice, may enter such temporary order as seems proper to the
court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than 30
days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to
the persons identified as herein provided in this subsection.
(g) If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court
or the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an
accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property
belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the
attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a
successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.
(h) In a proceeding under this act or in any other proceeding, or
upon petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:
(1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a power of attorney
to account;
(2) authorize the attorney in fact under a power of attorney to
enter into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any
transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is,
was or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power
to authorize for a conservator pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050 et seq. the
HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 93
Kansas uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective
arrangements act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto;
and
(3) relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise
authority for a disabled principal under a durable power of attorney.
(i) Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation,
any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach
of duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has
received an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter
unless a proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within
two years after receipt of the account or statement by the principal or, if
the principal is a disabled person, by a guardian or conservator of the
disabled person's estate. If a disabled person has no guardian or
conservator of the disabled person's estate at the time an account or
statement is presented, then the cause of action shall not be barred until
one year after the removal of the principal's disability or incapacity, one
year after the appointment of a conservator for the principal or one year
after the death of the principal. The cause of action thus barred does not
include any action to recover from an attorney in fact or successor for
fraud, misrepresentation or concealment related to the settlement of any
transaction involving the agency relationship of the attorney in fact
with the principal.

patient's presence cannot be waived.

patient at all stages of the proceedings and until all orders resulting

facility to which the proposed patient may be sent as provided for
subsection (b)(8) of in K.S.A. 59-29b57(b)(8), and amendments
thereto, but instead stated that the secretary for aging and disability
services has been notified and requested to determine which treatment
facility the proposed patient should be sent to, then the court shall issue
an order requiring the secretary, or the secretary's designee, to make
that determination and to notify the court of the name and address of
that treatment facility by such time as the court shall specify in the
court's order.

order of continuance, for good cause shown, to any party for no longer
than seven days, except that such limitation does not apply to a request
for an order of continuance made by the proposed patient or to a
request made by any party if the proposed patient is absent such that

terminates:
(1) On the minor's death, adoption, emancipation or attainment of
majority; or

amendments thereto, for appointment of a guardian is not satisfied,
unless the court finds that:

of a minor, or the guardian of a minor may choose, to develop and file
with the court a plan of care for the minor. Any such plan must be

59 and 60, and amendments thereto. The court may not approve the
plan until 30 days after the filing.
(e) After the guardian's plan filed under this section is approved
by the court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the minor
if the minor is 12 years of age or older, to any attorney representing the
minor in the guardianship proceeding or any other proceeding
concerning the care or custody of the minor identified in the petition, to

court may:
(1) Appoint a guardian for an adult if the court finds by clear and

limitations of the respondent and issue orders that will encourage

independence. The court may not establish a full guardianship if a
limited guardianship, protective arrangement instead of guardianship or
other less restrictive alternatives would meet the needs of the
respondent.

shall give preference in the appointment of an attorney to any attorney

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 31
who has represented the respondent in other matters if the court has
knowledge of that prior representation or to an attorney whom the
respondent has requested. Any appointment made by the court shall
terminate after the guardian's plan has been approved and after any
appeal from the appointment of a guardian, unless the court continues
the appointment by further order. Thereafter, an attorney may be
appointed by the court if requested, in writing, by the adult subject to

proceeding, including respondent's attorney fees, may be paid from the
respondent's assets.
New Sec. 69. (a) Upon the filing of the petition or any other time
at or before the hearing, if the contents of the petition or evidence at the
hearing support a prima facie case of the need for a guardian, the court
shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
mental health center, community developmental disability organization
or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, physician
assistant, nurse practitioner, social worker or other professional
appointed by the court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's
alleged cognitive and functional abilities and limitations and will not be
advantaged or disadvantaged by a decision to grant the petition or
otherwise have a conflict of interest.
(b) Unless otherwise specified by the court, the report of the
examination and evaluation submitted to the court shall contain:
(1) The respondent's name, age and date of birth;

occurred, and the name or names of the professional or professionals
performing the examination and evaluation and such professional's
qualifications;

personally completed an independent examination and evaluation of the
respondent, and that the report submitted to the court contains the
results of that examination and evaluation, and the professional's
opinion with regard to the issues of whether or not the respondent is in
need of a guardian and whether there are barriers to the respondent's
attendance and participation at the hearing on the petition; and
(9) the signature of the professional who prepared the report.
(c) The professional shall file with the court, at least five days
prior to the date of the trial, such professional's written report
concerning the examination and evaluation ordered by the court. The
report shall be made available by the court to counsel for all parties.
(d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation
as provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of
this section and that no further examination or evaluation should be
required, unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such
an examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be
filed with the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at
least four days prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request
shall be a statement of the reasons why an examination and evaluation
is requested and the name and address of a qualified professional or
facility willing and able to conduct this examination and evaluation. If
the court orders a further examination and evaluation, the court may
continue the trial and fix a new date, time and place of the trial at a time
not to exceed 30 days from the date of the filing of the request.
New Sec. 70. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may not proceed
unless the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible
for the respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings
typically are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the
hearing at an alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow
the respondent to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual
technology.
(b) A hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto, may
proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
and convincing evidence that:
(1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after
having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential
consequences of failing to do so; or
(2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services and
technological assistance.
(c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 66,
and amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's
choosing, assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a
combination of these supports. If assistance would facilitate the
respondent's participation in the hearing, but is not otherwise available
to the respondent, the court shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.
(d) The respondent has a right to retain an attorney to represent the
respondent at a hearing under section 66, and amendments thereto.

the respondent may:

guardian shall attend a hearing under section 66, and amendments
thereto.

with or without a hearing, on determining that the best interest of the
respondent will be served. The court may impose appropriate
conditions on the person's participation.
New Sec. 71. (a) The existence of a proceeding for or the
existence of a guardianship for an adult is a matter of public record
unless the court seals the record after:
(1) The respondent or individual subject to guardianship requests
the record be sealed; and

or not a guardian is appointed;
(B) an attorney designated by the adult;

amendments thereto, or a subsequent order; and
(D) a licensed attorney, abstractor or title insurance agent.
(4) A person not otherwise entitled to access court records under
this subsection for good cause may request permission from the court
for access to court records of the guardianship, including the guardian's
report and plan. The court shall grant access if access is in the best
interest of the respondent or adult subject to guardianship or furthers
the public interest and does not endanger the welfare or financial
interests of the adult.
(c) A report under section 67, and amendments thereto, of a court
liaison or a professional evaluation under section 69, and amendments
thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

(2) the individual who is the subject of the report or evaluation,
without limitation as to use;
(3) the petitioner, court liaison and petitioner's and respondent's
attorneys, for purposes of the proceeding;
(4) unless the court orders otherwise, an agent appointed under a
power of attorney for healthcare or power of attorney for finances in
which the respondent is the principal; and
(5) any other person if it is in the public interest or for a purpose
the court orders for good cause.

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 34
New Sec. 72. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),

care and concern for the respondent; and

other close family member of the respondent.
(b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection
(a), the court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best
qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall
consider the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's
skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the
person and the respondent have similar values and preferences and the
likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a guardian
successfully.
(c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
decline to appoint as guardian a person having priority under
subsection (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no
priority.
(d) In determining whether the appointment of a proposed
guardian is in the best interest of the respondent, the court shall
consider the number of other cases in which the proposed guardian,
other than a corporation, is currently serving as guardian, particularly if
that number is more than 15.
(e) The following persons shall not be appointed as guardian
unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person

individual who is employed by a person that provides paid services to
the respondent, or is the spouse, parent or child of an individual who

employee of an agency, partnership or corporation that provides care or
other services to persons with needs similar to those of the respondent.
New Sec. 73. (a) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult
must:
(1) Include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by
a protective arrangement instead of guardianship or other less
restrictive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive services,
technological assistance or supported decision making; and
(2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on
the petition.
(b) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must
state the basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific
findings that support the conclusion that a limited guardianship would
not meet the functional needs of the adult subject to guardianship.
(c) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 35
must state the specific powers granted to the guardian.
(d) A court order appointing a guardian for an adult must include
the date of a review hearing to be set 90 days after the order of
appointment is entered. At that hearing, the court shall review the
guardian's plan filed pursuant to section 79, and amendments thereto.
(e) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an
adult, shall identify any person that subsequently is entitled to:
(1) Notice of the rights of the adult under section 74(b), and

(3) notice that the guardian will be unavailable to visit the adult
for more than two months or unavailable to perform the guardian's

the court has removed the guardian.
(f) A spouse and adult children of an adult subject to guardianship
are entitled to notice under subsection (e) unless the court determines

adult subject to guardianship or not in the best interest of the adult.
New Sec. 74. (a) Not later than 14 days after the appointment, a
guardian appointed under section 72, and amendments thereto, shall
give the adult subject to guardianship and all other persons given notice
under section 66, and amendments thereto, a copy of the order of

other person entitled to notice under section 72(e), and amendments
thereto, or a subsequent order a statement of the rights of the adult
subject to guardianship and procedures to seek relief if the adult is
denied those rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, in
plain language and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the
adult subject to guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify
the adult subject to guardianship of the right to:
(1) Seek termination or modification of the guardianship, or
removal of the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult
in these matters;

benefits of healthcare options to the extent reasonably feasible;
(5) be notified at least 14 days before a change in the adult's
primary dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health
facility or other facility that places restrictions on the individual's

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 36
in the guardian's plan under section 79, and amendments thereto, or
authorized by the court by specific order;
(6) object to a change or move described in paragraph (5) and the
process for objecting;
(7) communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
visitors, and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or
electronic communications, including through social media, unless:
(A) The guardian has been authorized by the court by specific
order to restrict communications, visits or interactions;
(B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of
guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a
person; or
(C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult, and the
restriction is:
(i) For a period of not more than seven business days if the person
has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
(ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not
have a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult;

amendments thereto, and the guardian's report under section 80, and
amendments thereto; and
(9) object to the guardian's plan or report.
(c) Any person required to provide notice under this section shall
file proof of service of such notice with the court.
New Sec. 75. (a) On its own after a petition has been filed under
section 65, and amendments thereto, or on verified petition by a person
interested in an adult's welfare, the court may appoint an emergency
guardian for the adult if the court finds a sufficient factual basis to
establish probable cause that:
(1) Appointment of an emergency guardian is necessary to prevent
imminent and substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety or
welfare;
(2) no other person has authority and willingness to act in the
circumstances; and
(3) a basis for appointment of a guardian under section 64, and
amendments thereto, exists.
(b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an
adult may not exceed 30 days, and the emergency guardian may
exercise only the powers specified in the order of appointment. The
emergency guardian's authority may be extended up to three times for
not more than 30 days per extension if the court finds good cause and
that the conditions for appointment of an emergency guardian in
subsection (a) continue.
(c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for appointment of an
emergency guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to
represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as otherwise
provided in subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time, and
place of a hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the
respondent's attorney and any other person the court determines.
(d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult
without notice to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the
court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's physical
health, safety or welfare will be substantially harmed before a hearing
with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an
emergency guardian without giving notice under subsection (c), the
court must:
(1) Give notice of the appointment not later than 48 hours after the

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 37
appointment to:
(A) The respondent;
(B) the respondent's attorney; and
(C) any other person the court determines; and
(2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not
later than five days after the appointment.
(e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is
not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian
under section 64, and amendments thereto.
(f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under
this section at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report
the court requires.
New Sec. 76. (a) A guardian for an adult is a fiduciary. A guardian
shall strive to assure that the personal, civil and human rights of the
individual subject to guardianship are protected. Except as otherwise
limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make decisions
regarding the support, care, education, health and welfare of the adult
subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated by the adult's
limitations and in accordance with the guardian's plan under section 79,
and amendments thereto.
(b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of
the adult and, to the extent reasonably feasible, include the adult in
decision making, and encourage the adult to participate in decisions, act
on the adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage
the adult's personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian
shall:
(1) Become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and
maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular
visitation, to know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities
and physical and mental health;
(2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and
preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the
adult, including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities or
social interactions; and
(3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive
relationships and services for the adult.
(c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable
care, diligence and prudence when acting on behalf of or making
decisions for the adult. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall:
(1) Take reasonable care of the personal effects and service or
support animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a
conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of conservatorship if
necessary to protect the adult's property;
(2) if authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
thereto, expend funds and other property of the adult received by the
guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education,
health and welfare;
(3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not
expended under paragraph (2) for the adult's future needs, but if a
conservator has been appointed for the adult, pay the funds and other
property at least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the
adult's future needs; and
(4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care
services, provided to the adult.
(d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the
guardian shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the
adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would
unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial
interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject to

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 38
guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's
previous or current directions, preferences, opinions, cultural practices,
religious beliefs, values and actions, to the extent actually known or
reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
(e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under
subsection (d) because the guardian does not know and cannot
reasonably determine the decision the adult probably would make if
able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would
make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or
financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with
the best interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the
adult, the guardian shall consider:
(1) Information received from professionals and persons that
demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult;
(2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have
considered if the adult were able to act; and
(3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the
adult would consider, including consequences for others.
(f) A guardian for an adult shall notify the court immediately if the
condition of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of
exercising rights previously removed.
New Sec. 77. (a) Except as limited by court order, a guardian for
an adult may:
(1) If authorized by the court under section 78, and amendments
thereto, apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the
adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application
or receipt is within the powers of the conservator;
(2) establish the adult's place of dwelling;
(3) consent to health, including mental health, or other care,
treatment or service for the adult;
(4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed,
commence a proceeding including an administrative proceeding, or
take other appropriate action to compel another person to support the
adult or pay funds for the adult's benefit; and
(5) receive personally identifiable healthcare information
regarding the adult.
(b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an
adult to consent to the adoption of the adult.
(c) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an
adult to litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce,
dissolution or annulment of marriage of the individual subject to
guardianship, including negotiation of a settlement thereof.
(d) In determining whether to authorize a power under subsection
(b) or (c), the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be
in accordance with the adult's preferences, values and prior directions
and whether the underlying act would be in the adult's best interest.
(e) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(2) to
establish the adult's place of dwelling, the guardian shall:
(1) Select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult
would select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-
making standard in section 76(d) and (e), and amendments thereto. If
the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine what
setting the adult subject to guardianship probably would choose if able,
or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would make
would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or
financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall choose in accordance
with section 76(e), and amendments thereto, a residential setting that is
consistent with the adult's best interest;
(2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 39
residential setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with
persons important to the adult and meet the adult's needs in the least
restrictive manner reasonably feasible unless to do so would be
inconsistent with the decision-making standard in section 76(d) and (e),
and amendments thereto;
(3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the
adult:
(A) Give notice of the change to the court, the adult and any
person identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing
the guardian or a subsequent order; and
(B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new
dwelling and state whether the adult received advance notice of the
change and whether the adult objected to the change;
(4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult
to a nursing home, mental health facility or other facility that places
restrictions on the adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if:
(A) The establishment or move is in the guardian's plan under
section 79, and amendments thereto;
(B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or
(C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at least
14 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons
entitled to notice under section 73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a
subsequent order, and no objection is filed;
(5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside
this state only if consistent with the guardian's plan and authorized by
the court by specific order; and
(6) take action that would result in the sale of or surrender of the
lease to the primary dwelling of the adult only if:
(A) The action is specifically included in the guardian's plan under
section 79, and amendments thereto;
(B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or
(C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the
action to the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under section
73(e)(2), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order and no
objection has been filed.
(f) In exercising a guardian's power under subsection (a)(3) to
make healthcare decisions, the guardian shall:
(1) Involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably
feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting
the adult in understanding the risks and benefits of healthcare options;
(2) act in accordance with any declaration of the adult made
pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-28,109, and
amendments thereto; and
(3) take into account:
(A) The risks and benefits of treatment options; and
(B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult, if
known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian.
New Sec. 78. (a) A guardian for an adult shall not initiate the
commitment of the adult to a mental health facility except in
accordance with the care and treatment act for mentally ill persons,
K.S.A. 59-2945 et seq., and amendments thereto.
(b) A guardian for an adult shall not restrict the ability of the adult
to communicate, visit or interact with others, including receiving
visitors and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail or
electronic communications, including through social media, or
participating in social activities, unless:
(1) Authorized by the court by specific order;
(2) a protective order or a protective arrangement instead of
guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 40
person; or
(3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary
because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant
physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult and the restriction
is:
(A) For a period of not more than seven business days if the
person has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; or
(B) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person does not
have a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult.
(c) A guardian for an adult shall not consent, on behalf of the
adult, to:
(1) Any psychosurgery, removal of any bodily organ or
amputation of any limb, unless such surgery, removal or amputation
has been approved in advance by the court, except in an emergency and
when necessary to preserve the life of the adult or to prevent serious
and irreparable impairment to the physical health of the adult;
(2) the sterilization of the adult, unless approved by the court
following a due process hearing held for the purposes of determining
whether to approve such, and during which hearing the adult is
represented by an attorney appointed by the court;
(3) the performance of any experimental biomedical or behavioral
procedure on the adult, or for the adult to be a participant in any
biomedical or behavioral experiment, without the prior review and
approval of such by either an institutional review board as provided for
in title 45, part 46 of the code of federal regulations, or if such
regulations do not apply, then by a review committee established by the
agency, institution or treatment facility at which the procedure or
experiment is proposed to occur, composed of members selected for the
purposes of determining whether the proposed procedure or
experiment:
(A) Does not involve any significant risk of harm to the physical
or mental health of the adult, or the use of aversive stimulants, and is
intended to preserve the life or health of the adult or to assist the adult
to develop or regain skills or abilities; or
(B) involves a significant risk of harm to the physical or mental
health of the adult, or the use of an aversive stimulant, but that the
conducting of the proposed procedure or experiment is intended either
to preserve the life of the adult, or to significantly improve the quality
of life of the adult, or to assist the adult to develop or regain significant
skills or abilities, and that the guardian has been fully informed
concerning the potential risks and benefits of the proposed procedure or
experiment or of any aversive stimulant proposed to be used, and as to
how and under what circumstances the aversive stimulant may be used,
and has specifically consented to such;
(4) the withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-sustaining
medical care, treatment, services or procedures, except:
(A) In accordance with the provisions of any declaration of the
adult made pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 65-28,101 through 65-
28,109, and amendments thereto;
(B) if the adult, prior to the court's appointment of a guardian, has
executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions pursuant
to K.S.A. 58-625, et seq., and amendments thereto, and that durable
power of attorney has not previously been revoked by the adult, and it
includes any provision relevant to the withholding or withdrawal of
life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
procedures, then the guardian shall act as provided for in that power of
attorney, even if the guardian has revoked or amended that power of
attorney pursuant to the authority of K.S.A. 58-627, and amendments
thereto; or

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 41
(C) in accordance with subsection (d) or (e).
(d) (1) It shall be presumed that every adult under guardianship
has directed such adult's guardian to direct the adult's healthcare
providers to provide such adult with nutrition or hydration or both to a
degree that is sufficient to sustain life. No court, guardian or any person
shall have the authority to make a decision on behalf of an adult who is
legally incapable of making healthcare decisions to withhold or
withdraw nutrition or hydration or both from such adult except if:
(A) The adult, when legally capable of making healthcare
decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawal of
nutrition or hydration or both under the adult's current circumstances.
Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a declaration or a
durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions described in
subsection (c)(4); or
(B) the adult's treating physician certifies in writing that, in the
physician's reasonable medical judgment:
(i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
would hasten death; or
(ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not contribute
to sustaining the adult's life.
(2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawing nutrition or hydration
or both under paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with the court
with the written certification from the adult's treating physician.
(B) Notice of such filing shall be provided to the adult subject to
guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
guardianship and any other person whom the court determines at the
time of filing of the petition.
(C) The court shall appoint an attorney for the adult. The court
may request that the state protection and advocacy agency as provided
by K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments thereto, or 42
U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e, represent the
adult.
(D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
thereafter as the court is available.
(E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawing
nutrition or hydration or both unless the court finds by clear and
convincing evidence that:
(i) The provision of nutrition or hydration or both to the adult
would hasten death; or
(ii) the adult would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the
nutrition or hydration or both so that its provision would not contribute
to sustaining the adult's life.
(3) (A) A cause of action for injunctive relief may be maintained:
(i) Against any person who is reasonably believed to be about to
violate or who is in the course of violating this subsection; or
(ii) to secure a court determination, notwithstanding the position
of a guardian, that the adult legally incapable of making healthcare
decisions, when legally capable of making such decisions, executed
expressly and with informed consent, a written directive to withdraw or
withhold hydration or nutrition or both in the applicable circumstances.
Such written directive shall be presumed valid unless there is clear and
convincing evidence to the contrary.
(B) The action may be brought by any person who is:
(i) The spouse, parent, child or sibling of the adult;
(ii) a current healthcare provider of the adult;
(iii) the guardian of the adult;
(iv) the state protection and advocacy agency as provided by

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 42
K.S.A. 65-5603(a)(10) or 74-5515, and amendments thereto, or 42
U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e; or
(v) a public official with appropriate jurisdiction to enforce the
laws of this state.
(C) Pending the final determination of the court, the court shall
direct that nutrition or hydration or both be provided to such adult
unless the court determines that paragraph (3)(A) is applicable.
(e) (1) No court, guardian or any person shall have the authority to
make a decision on behalf of an adult who is legally incapable of
making healthcare decisions to withhold or withdraw life-saving or
life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures from
such adult except if:

decisions, executed, expressly and with informed consent, a written
directive specifically authorizing the withholding or withdrawing of
life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
procedures from such adult under the adult's current circumstances.
Such directive shall include, but not be limited to, a declaration or a
durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions described in
subsection (c)(4); or
(B) (i) The adult's treating physician certifies in writing to the
guardian that the adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong the
dying process; and
(ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or by
any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's order
that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-saving or
life-sustaining medical care.
(2) (A) Prior to withholding or withdrawal of life-saving or life-
sustaining medical care, treatment, services or procedures under
paragraph (1)(B), a motion shall be filed with the court with the written

U.S.C. § 15043, 42 U.S.C. § 10805 or 29 U.S.C. § 794e, represent the
adult.
(D) The court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours or as soon
thereafter as the court is available.
(E) The court shall not authorize withholding or withdrawal of
life-saving or life-sustaining medical care, treatment, services or
procedures unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
that:
(i) The adult is suffering from a severe illness and that life-
sustaining medical care is objectively futile and would only prolong the
dying process; and
(ii) such opinion is concurred in by either a second physician or by
any medical ethics or similar committee to which the healthcare
provider has access established for the purposes of reviewing such
circumstances and the appropriateness of any type of physician's order
that would have the effect of withholding or withdrawing life-saving or
life-sustaining medical care.
(f) A guardian for an adult shall not exercise any control or

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 43
authority over the adult's estate, unless specifically authorized by the
court. Any guardian who is granted such authority shall prepare an
inventory and provide notice of the inventory as provided in section
104, and amendments thereto. The court may assign such authority to
the guardian and may waive the requirement of the posting of a bond,
only if:
(1) Initially, the combined value of any funds and assets owned by
the adult equals $25,000 or less; and
(2) either the court requires the guardian to report to the court the
commencement of the exercising of such authority, or requires the
guardian to obtain court authorization to commence the exercise of
such authority, as the court shall specify; and
(3) the court also requires the guardian, whenever the combined
value of such funds and property exceeds $25,000, to:

amendments thereto, that contains elements similar to those that would
be contained in a conservator's plan as provided for in section 103, and
amendments thereto;
(B) petition the court for appointment of a conservator; or
(C) notify the court as the court shall specify that the value of the
adult's estate has equaled or exceeded $25,000, if the court has earlier
appointed a conservator but did not issue letters of conservatorship
pending such notification;
(g) A guardian for an adult shall not access digital assets of the
adult unless authorized by the court pursuant to K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 58-
4814, and amendments thereto.

when there is a significant change in circumstances, or the guardian
seeks to deviate significantly from the existing guardian's plan, a
guardian for an adult shall file with the court a plan for the care of the
adult. The plan must be based on the needs of the adult and take into
account the best interest of the adult as well as the adult's preferences,

ascertainable by the guardian. The guardian shall include in the plan:
(1) The living arrangement, services and supports the guardian
expects to arrange, facilitate or continue for the adult;

charge for each service the guardian anticipates providing to the adult.

under subsection (a), together with a copy of the plan, to the adult
subject to guardianship, any attorney representing the adult subject to
guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and
amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the

subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the guardian's plan may

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 44
object to the plan in writing no later than 21 days after the filing.
(d) The court shall review the guardian's plan filed under
subsection (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a
new plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall
consider an objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is
consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under sections 76 and
77, and amendments thereto. The court shall review an initial
guardian's plan at the review hearing scheduled under section 73(b),
and amendments thereto. When reviewing subsequent guardian's plans,
the court has discretion whether to set the matter for hearing but may
not approve the plan until 30 days after the filing.

guardianship, a person entitled to notice under section 73(e), and
amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other person the

preferences, values, prior directions and best interest;
(8) anything of more than de minimis value which the guardian,
any individual who resides with the guardian, or the spouse, parent,
child or sibling of the guardian has received from an individual
providing goods or services to the adult;
(9) any circumstance that may constitute a conflict of interest
between the guardian and the adult. A conflict of interest occurs where

adult's estate to equal or exceed $25,000;
(5) the death of the adult; or
(6) a change in the circumstances of the guardian or the adult that
may constitute a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs where
the guardian has some personal, business or agency interest that could
be perceived as self-serving or adverse to the position or best interest of
the adult.
(d) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report
submitted under this section or a guardian's plan submitted under

for an adult are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine whether to adjust the requested fees.

hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar
facts was filed during the preceding six months;

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 47
services available to the adult have changed;
(3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
needs of the adult or supports or services available to the adult have

court settlements, death transfers or sources other than the minor's
employment earnings or accounts established under the uniform
transfers to minors act, and either:
(1) The minor owns funds or other property requiring management
or protection that otherwise cannot be provided;
(2) the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put at

arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive
alternative.
(c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers
necessitated by demonstrated limitations and needs of the adult and
issue orders that will encourage development of the adult's maximum
self-determination and independence. The court may not establish a full
conservatorship if a limited conservatorship, protective arrangement
instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative would
meet the needs of the adult.

appointment of a conservator:

(E) the reason a protective arrangement or other less restrictive
alternative is insufficient to meet the respondent's need;
(7) whether the petitioner seeks a limited conservatorship or a full
conservatorship;
(8) if the petitioner seeks a full conservatorship, the reason a
limited conservatorship or protective arrangement instead of
conservatorship is not appropriate;
(9) if the petition is for a limited conservatorship, a description of
the property to be placed under the conservator's control and any
requested limitation on the authority of the conservator;

New Sec. 85. (a) On filing of a petition under section 84, and
amendments thereto, for appointment of a conservator, the court shall
set a date, time and place for a hearing on the petition.
(b) A copy of a petition under section 84, and amendments thereto,
and notice of a hearing on the petition must be served personally on the
respondent. If the respondent's whereabouts are unknown or personal
service cannot be made, service on the respondent must be made by
substituted service, as ordered by the court. The notice must inform the
respondent of the respondent's rights at the hearing, including the right

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 50
to an attorney and to attend the hearing. The notice must include a
description of the nature, purpose and consequences of granting the
petition. The court may not grant a petition for appointment of a

served on the respondent. The court may order any of the following
persons to serve the notice upon the respondent:

amendments thereto, the notice required under subsection (b) must be
given to the persons required to be listed in the petition under section
84(b)(1) through (3), and amendments thereto, and any other person
interested in the respondent's welfare the court determines. Failure to
give notice under this subsection does not preclude the court from
appointing a conservator.
(d) After the appointment of a conservator, notice of a hearing on
a petition for any other order under sections 83 through 118, and
amendments thereto, together with a copy of the petition, must be given
to:

New Sec. 86. While a petition under section 84, and amendments
thereto, is pending, after preliminary hearing and without notice to
others, the court may issue an order to preserve and apply property of
the respondent as required for the support of the respondent or an
individual who is in fact dependent on the respondent. The court may
appoint an emergency conservator to assist in implementing the order.
New Sec. 87. (a) If the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a

petition.
(c) (1) A court liaison appointed under subsection (b) for an adult
shall interview the respondent in person and in a manner the respondent
is best able to understand:
(A) Explain, in general, the petition, and the nature and purpose of
the proceeding, including the potential loss of rights as a result of the

the petitioner, including views about a proposed conservator, the
conservator's proposed powers and duties and the scope and duration of
the proposed conservatorship.
(2) These explanations and discussions are not intended to be a
substitute for the attorney appointed to represent the respondent to
inform the respondent of the respondent's rights and the nature and
purpose of the proceeding.
(d) A court liaison appointed under subsection (b) for an adult may
be assigned any or all of the following duties, in the discretion of the

a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less
restrictive alternative for meeting the respondent's needs is available;

hearing and which identifies any technology or other form of support

(5) any other matter the court directs.
(d) The costs of an investigation by a court liaison shall be
assessed as provided for in section 42, and amendments thereto.
New Sec. 88. (a) Unless the respondent in a proceeding for
appointment of a conservator is represented by an attorney, the court

respondent's ability to pay. The court shall give preference in the
appointment of an attorney to any attorney who has represented the
respondent in other matters if the court has knowledge of that prior
representation or to an attorney whom the respondent has requested.
Any appointment made by the court shall terminate after the
conservator's plan has been approved and after any appeal from the
appointment of a conservator, unless the court continues the
appointment by further order. Thereafter, an attorney may be appointed
by the court if requested, in writing, by the adult subject to
conservatorship, the conservator or upon the court's own motion.
(b) An attorney representing the respondent in a proceeding for
appointment of a conservator shall:
(1) Make reasonable efforts to ascertain the respondent's wishes;
(2) advocate for the respondent's wishes to the extent reasonably
ascertainable; and

proceeding, including respondent's attorney fees, may be paid from the
respondent's assets.

amendments thereto, if the court determines the parent needs
representation.
New Sec. 89. (a) Upon the filing of the petition or any other time
at or before the hearing, if the contents of the petition or evidence at the
hearing support a prima facie case of the need for a conservator, the
court shall order an examination and evaluation of the respondent to be
conducted through a general hospital, psychiatric hospital, community
mental health center or community developmental disability
organization, or by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist,
physician assistant, nurse practitioner, social worker or other
professional appointed by the court who is qualified to evaluate the
respondent's alleged cognitive and functional abilities and limitations
and will not be advantaged or disadvantaged by a decision to grant the
petition or otherwise have a conflict of interest.

recommendation for treatment or rehabilitation;
(5) a list and description of any prior assessments, evaluations or
examinations of the respondent, including the dates thereof, which were
relied upon in the preparation of this evaluation;

occurred, and the name or names of the professional or professionals
performing the examination and evaluation and such professional's
qualifications;
(7) a statement by the professional that the professional has
personally completed an independent examination and evaluation of the
respondent, and that the report submitted to the court contains the
results of that examination and evaluation, and the professional's
opinion with regard to the issues of whether or not the respondent is in
need of a conservator and whether there are barriers to the respondent's
attendance and participation at the hearing on the petition; and
(8) the signature of the professional who prepared the report.
(c) The professional shall file with the court, at least five days
prior to the date of the trial, such professional's written report
concerning the examination and evaluation ordered by the court. The

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 53
report shall be made available by the court to counsel for all parties.
(d) In lieu of entering an order for an examination and evaluation
as provided for in this section, the court may determine that the report
accompanying the petition is in compliance with the requirements of
this section and that no further examination or evaluation should be
required, unless the respondent, or such person's attorney, requests such
an examination and evaluation in writing. Any such request shall be
filed with the court, and a copy thereof delivered to the petitioner, at
least four days prior to the date of the trial. Accompanying the request
shall be a statement of the reasons why an examination and evaluation
is requested and the name and address of a qualified professional or

not to exceed 30 days from the date of the filing of the request.
New Sec. 90. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a
hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may not proceed
unless the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible
for the respondent to attend a hearing at the location court proceedings
typically are held, the court shall make reasonable efforts to hold the
hearing at an alternative location convenient to the respondent or allow
the respondent to attend the hearing using real-time audio-visual
technology.
(b) A hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto, may
proceed without the respondent in attendance if the court finds by clear
and convincing evidence that:
(1) The respondent is choosing not to attend the hearing after
having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential
consequences of failing to do so;
(2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and
participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services or
technological assistance; or
(3) the respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and
attendance would be harmful to the minor.
(c) The respondent may be assisted in a hearing under section 85,
and amendments thereto, by a person or persons of the respondent's
choosing, assistive technology or an interpreter or translator, or a
combination of these supports. If assistance would facilitate the
respondent's participation in the hearing, but is not otherwise available
to the respondent, the court shall make reasonable efforts to provide it.

respondent at a hearing under section 85, and amendments thereto.

with or without a hearing, on determining that the best interest of the
respondent will be served. The court may impose appropriate
conditions on the person's participation.
New Sec. 91. (a) The existence of a proceeding for or the

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 54
existence of conservatorship is a matter of public record unless the
court seals the record after:
(1) The respondent, the individual subject to conservatorship or

(4) A person not otherwise entitled to access to court records
under this section for good cause may request permission from the
court for access to court records of the conservatorship, including the

the best interest of the respondent or individual subject to
conservatorship or furthers the public interest and does not endanger
the welfare or financial interests of the respondent or individual.
(c) A report under section 87, and amendments thereto, of a court
liaison or professional evaluation under section 89, and amendments
thereto, is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to:

without limitation as to use;
(3) the petitioner, court liaison and petitioner's and respondent's
attorneys, for purposes of the proceeding;

(b) If two or more persons have equal priority under subsection
(a), the court shall select as conservator the person the court considers
best qualified. In determining the best qualified person, the court shall
consider the person's relationship with the respondent, the person's
skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the extent to which the
person and the respondent have similar values and preferences and the
likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a conservator
successfully.
(c) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may
decline to appoint as conservator a person having priority under
subsection (a) and appoint a person having a lower priority or no

met by a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other
less restrictive alternative, including use of appropriate supportive
services, technological assistance or supported decision making; and
(2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence
established the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on
the petition.
(c) A court order establishing a full conservatorship for an adult
must state the basis for granting a full conservatorship and include
specific findings to support the conclusion that a limited
conservatorship would not meet the functional needs of the adult.
(d) A court order establishing a limited conservatorship must state
the specific property placed under the control of the conservator and the
powers granted to the conservator.
(e) A court order appointing a conservator must include the date of

section 84, and amendments thereto, or on a verified petition by a

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 57
person interested in an individual's welfare, the court may appoint an

factual basis to establish probable cause that:

subsection (d), reasonable notice of the date, time and place of a
hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the
respondent's attorney and any other person the court determines.
(d) The court may appoint an emergency conservator without
notice to the respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the
court finds from an affidavit or testimony that the respondent's property
or financial interests will be substantially and irreparably harmed
before a hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the
court appoints an emergency conservator without giving notice under
subsection (c), the court must give notice of the appointment not later
than 48 hours after the appointment to:

(3) any other person the court determines.
(e) Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall

under this section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make
any report the court requires.

New Sec. 97. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c),
the court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond with a surety, or
require an alternative asset-protection arrangement, conditioned on
faithful discharge of all duties of the conservator. The court may waive
the requirement only if the court finds that a bond or other asset-
protection arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the
individual subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (c), the court may not waive the requirement if the
conservator is in the business of serving as a conservator and is being
paid for the conservator's service.
(b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this
section must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the
conservatorship estate, plus one year's estimated income, less the value
of property deposited under an arrangement requiring a court order for
its removal, and less the value of real property. The court, in place of
surety on a bond, may accept collateral for the performance of the
bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of real property.
(c) A regulated financial-service institution qualified to do trust
business in this state is not required to give a bond under this section.
(d) If the conservator appointed is under contract with the Kansas
guardianship program, the Kansas department for children and families
shall act as surety on the bond.
New Sec. 98. (a) The following rules apply to the bond required
under section 97, and amendments thereto:
(1) Except as otherwise provided by the bond, the surety and the
conservator are jointly and severally liable.
(2) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety
submits to the personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of
office to the conservator in a proceeding relating to the duties of the
conservator in which the surety is named as a party. Notice of the
proceeding must be given to the surety at the address shown in the
records of the court in which the bond is filed and any other address of
the surety then known to the person required to provide the notice.
(3) On petition of a successor conservator or person affected by a
breach of the obligation of the bond, a proceeding may be brought
against the surety for breach of the obligation of the bond.

under the bond is exhausted.
(b) A proceeding may not be brought under this section against a
surety of a bond on a matter as to which a proceeding against the
conservator is barred.
(c) If a bond under section 97, and amendments thereto, is not
renewed by the conservator, the surety or sureties immediately shall

Upon receiving such notice, the clerk of the district court shall forward
the notice to the presiding judge who shall set the matter for hearing
and determine who should receive notice.
New Sec. 99. (a) A conservator is a fiduciary and has duties of
prudence, loyalty, reasonable care and diligence to the individual
subject to conservatorship.
(b) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the
individual subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible,
encourage the individual to participate in decisions, act on the
individual's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage
the individual's personal affairs. A conservator shall strive to assure that
the personal, civil and human rights of the individual subject to
conservatorship are protected.
(c) In making a decision for an individual subject to
conservatorship, the conservator shall make the decision that the

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 59
conservator reasonably believes the individual would make if able,
unless doing so would fail to preserve the resources needed to maintain
the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably
harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the
individual. To determine the decision the individual would make if
able, the conservator shall consider the individual's prior or current
directions, preferences, opinions, values and actions, to the extent
actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator.
(d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under subsection (c)
because the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably
determine the decision the individual subject to conservatorship
probably would make if able, or the conservator reasonably believes the
decision the individual would make would fail to preserve resources
needed to maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or
otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or
financial interests of the individual, the conservator shall act in
accordance with the best interest of the individual. In determining the
best interest of the individual, the conservator shall consider:

hindsight.

relevant to the investment and management of the conservatorship

unless the conservatorship estate lacks sufficient funds to pay for

not the trust extends beyond the duration of the conservatorship;

conservatorship pursuant to K.S.A. 58a-411 or 58a-602, and
amendments thereto;

under an insurance policy or annuity or surrender the policy or annuity

(14) renounce or disclaim a property interest;
(15) grant a creditor priority for payment over creditors of the
same or higher class if the creditor is providing property or services
used to meet the basic living and care needs of the individual subject to
conservatorship and preferential treatment otherwise would be
impermissible under section 110(e), and amendments thereto; and
(16) litigate as petitioner or respondent an action for divorce,
dissolution or annulment of marriage of the individual subject to
conservatorship, including negotiation of a settlement thereof.
(b) The court shall set the matter for hearing and, if the individual

appoint an attorney to represent the individual.

whenever there is a significant change in circumstances or the
conservator seeks to deviate significantly from the existing
conservator's plan, a conservator shall file with the court a plan for
protecting, managing, expending and distributing the assets of the
conservatorship estate. The plan must be based on the needs of the
individual subject to conservatorship and take into account the best
interest of the individual as well as the individual's preferences, values
and prior directions, to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable
by the conservator. The conservator shall include in the plan:
(1) A budget containing projected expenses and resources,
including an estimate of the total amount of fees the conservator
anticipates charging per year and a statement or list of the amount the

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 64
conservator proposes to charge for each service the conservator

plan, to the individual subject to conservatorship, any attorney
representing the individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled

order, and any other person the court determines. The notice must
include a statement of the right to object to the plan and must be given
at the time of the filing.
(c) An individual subject to conservatorship and any person
entitled under subsection (b) to receive notice and a copy of the
conservator's plan may object to the plan in writing not later than 21
days after the filing.
(d) The court shall review the conservator's plan filed under
subsection (a) and determine whether to approve the plan or require a
new plan. In deciding whether to approve the plan, the court shall
consider an objection under subsection (c) and whether the plan is
consistent with the conservator's duties and powers. The court shall
review an initial conservator's plan at the review hearing scheduled
under section 93(e), and amendments thereto. For subsequent
conservator's plans, the court has discretion whether to set the matter
for hearing but may not approve the plan until 30 days after the filing.
(e) After a conservator's plan under this section is approved by the
court, the conservator shall provide a copy of the plan to the individual
subject to conservatorship, any attorney representing the individual
subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section
93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any other
person the court determines.

reasonable request of the individual subject to conservatorship, a
guardian for the individual, or any other person the conservator or the
court determines.
New Sec. 105. (a) A conservator shall file with the court a report
in a record regarding the administration of the conservatorship estate
annually unless the court otherwise directs, on resignation or removal,
on termination of the conservatorship, and at any other time the court
directs.
(b) A report under subsection (a) must state or contain:

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 65
(1) An accounting that lists property included in the
conservatorship estate and the receipts, disbursements, liabilities and
distributions during the period for which the report is made;
(2) a list of the services provided to the individual subject to
conservatorship;
(3) a statement whether the conservator has deviated from the
conservator's most recently approved plan and, if so, how the
conservator has deviated and why;
(4) a recommendation as to the need for continued conservatorship
and any recommended change in the scope of the conservatorship;
(5) to the extent feasible, a copy of the most recent reasonably
available financial statements evidencing the status of bank accounts,
investment accounts and mortgages or other debts of the individual
subject to conservatorship with account numbers and social security
number redacted;

any individual who resides with the conservator, or the spouse, parent,
child or sibling of the conservator has received from a person providing
goods or services to the individual subject to conservatorship;
(7) any business relation the conservator has with a person the
conservator has paid or that has benefited from the property of the
individual subject to conservatorship;
(8) whether any co-conservator or successor conservator
appointed to serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to
serve; and
(9) a copy of the bond renewal.
(c) The court may appoint a court liaison to review a report under
this section or conservator's plan under section 103, and amendments
thereto, interview the individual subject to conservatorship or
conservator, or investigate any other matter involving the
conservatorship. In connection with the report, the court may order the
conservator to submit the conservatorship estate to appropriate
examination in a manner the court directs.
(d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report,
together with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual
subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under section
93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and other
persons the court determines. The notice and report must be given not
later than 14 days after filing.
(e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report
submitted under this section and review each report at least annually to
determine whether:
(1) The reports provide sufficient information to establish the
conservator has complied with the conservator's duties;
(2) the conservatorship should continue; and
(3) the conservator's requested fees, if any, should be approved.
(f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator
has not complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship
should not continue, the court:
(1) Shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the
conservator and any other person entitled to notice under section 93(f),
and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order;
(2) may require additional information from the conservator;
(3) may appoint a court liaison to interview the individual subject
to conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving
the conservatorship; and
(4) consistent with sections 112 and 113, and amendments thereto,
may hold a hearing to consider removal of the conservator, termination
of the conservatorship or a change in the powers granted to the

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 66
conservator or terms of the conservatorship.
(g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a
conservator are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine whether to adjust the requested fees.
(h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report
filed under this section. The court after review may approve the report.
If the court approves the report, there is a rebuttable presumption the
report is accurate as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
(i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report
of a conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities
concerning a matter adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person
given notice of the report or accounting.
(j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report
filed under this section discharges the conservator from all liabilities,
claims and causes of action by a person given notice of the report and
the hearing as to a matter adequately disclosed in the report.
New Sec. 106. (a) The interest of an individual subject to
conservatorship in property included in the conservatorship estate is not
transferrable or assignable by the individual and is not subject to levy,
garnishment, or similar process for claims against the individual unless
allowed under section 110, and amendments thereto.
(b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a
contract after having the right to enter the contract removed by the
court, the contract is void against the individual and the individual's
property but is enforceable against the person that contracted with the
individual.
(c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an
individual subject to conservatorship with respect to property included
in the conservatorship estate is entitled to protection provided by law of
this state other than this act.
New Sec. 107. A transaction involving a conservatorship estate
which is affected by a substantial conflict between the conservator's
fiduciary duties and personal interests is voidable unless the transaction
is authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice
under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order. A
transaction affected by a substantial conflict includes a sale,
encumbrance or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate
entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the
conservator resides, the spouse, descendant, sibling, agent or attorney
of the conservator, or a corporation or other enterprise in which the
conservator has a substantial beneficial interest.
New Sec. 108. (a) A person that assists or deals with a conservator
in good faith and for value in any transaction, other than a transaction
requiring a court order under section 102, and amendments thereto, is
protected as though the conservator properly exercised any power in
question. Knowledge alone by a person that the person is dealing with a
conservator does not require the person to inquire into the existence of
authority of the conservator or the propriety of the conservator's
exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of
office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A
person that pays or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible
for proper application of the property.
(b) Protection under subsection (a) extends to a procedural
irregularity or jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the
issuance of letters of office and does not substitute for protection for a
person that assists or deals with a conservator provided by comparable
provisions in law of this state other than this act relating to a
commercial transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a
fiduciary.

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 67
New Sec. 109. (a) If an individual subject to conservatorship dies,
the conservator shall deliver to the district court any will of the
individual that is in the conservator's possession and inform the
personal representative named in the will if feasible. The conservator
shall give notice of the delivery of the will under this section to any
person entitled to notice under section 93(f), and amendments thereto,
or a subsequent order.
(b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the
conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship
estate as provided in section 113, and amendments thereto.
New Sec. 110. (a) A conservator may pay a claim against the
conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship
arising before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and
allowance in accordance with the priorities under subsection (d). A
claimant may present a claim by:
(1) Sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a
record of the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the
claimant and the amount claimed; or
(2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the
court, and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator.
(b) A claim under subsection (a) is presented on receipt by the
conservator of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of
the claim, whichever occurs first. A presented claim is allowed, if it is
not disallowed in whole or in part, by the conservator in a record sent
or delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its presentation.
Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim
to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a
court order or order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a
claim tolls until 30 days after disallowance of the claim the running of a
statute of limitations that has not expired relating to the claim.
(c) A claimant whose claim under subsection (a) has not been paid
may petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is
barred by a statute of limitations, and the court may order its allowance,
payment or security by encumbering property included in the
conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is pending against the individual
subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of the conservator
or is initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator
notice of the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the
conservatorship estate.
(d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all
existing claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in
money or in kind in payment of claims in the following order:
(1) Costs and expenses of administration;
(2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority
under law other than this act;
(3) a claim incurred by the conservator for support, care,
education, health or welfare previously provided to the individual
subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on
the individual subject to conservatorship;
(4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and
(5) all other claims.
(e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under
subsection (d) over another claim of the same class. A claim due and
payable may not be preferred over a claim not due unless:
(1) Doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without
sufficient funds to pay the basic living and healthcare expenses of the
individual subject to conservatorship; and
(2) the court authorizes the preference under section 102(a)(8),
and amendments thereto.

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 68
(f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all
existing claims, the court, acting in the best interest of the individual
subject to conservatorship, may order the conservator to grant a
security interest in the conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at
a future date.
New Sec. 111. (a) Except as otherwise agreed by a conservator,
the conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly entered
into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the
conservatorship estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the
conservator's representative capacity in the contract or before entering
into the contract.
(b) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising
from control of property of the conservatorship estate or an act or
omission occurring in the course of administration of the
conservatorship estate only if the conservator is personally at fault.
(c) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a
fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from control of property
included in the conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course
of administration of the conservatorship estate may be asserted against
the conservatorship estate in a proceeding against the conservator in a
fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is personally liable
for the claim.
(d) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the
conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for
accounting, surcharge, or indemnification or another appropriate
proceeding or action.
New Sec. 112. (a) The court may remove a conservator for failure
to perform the conservator's duties or other good cause and appoint a
successor conservator to assume the duties of the conservator.
(b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove
a conservator and appoint a successor on:
(1) Petition of the individual subject to conservatorship,
conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief that
removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may be
appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition
based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during the
preceding six months;
(2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship,
conservator or person interested in the welfare of the individual which
supports a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and
appointment of a successor may be appropriate;
(3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best
interest of the individual subject to conservatorship; or
(4) determination by the court that the conservator's reports and
accountings are delinquent or deficient as filed.
(c) Notice of a petition under subsection (b)(1) or any hearing
under this section must be given to the individual subject to
conservatorship, the conservator, a person entitled to notice under
section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order, and any
other person the court determines.
(d) If the individual subject to conservatorship is not represented
by an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same
conditions as in section 88, and amendments thereto. The court shall
award reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in section
42, and amendments thereto.
(e) In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the
priorities under section 92, and amendments thereto.
(f) Not later than 30 days after appointing a successor conservator,

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 69
the court or court's designee shall give notice of the appointment to the
individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to notice
under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.

or when the adult dies.
(c) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a
person interested in the welfare of the individual may petition for:

for appointment under section 83, and amendments thereto, does not
exist or termination would be in the best interest of the individual or for
other good cause; or
(2) modification of the conservatorship on the ground that the
extent of protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other
good cause.
(d) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether
termination or modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on:
(1) Petition under subsection (c) which contains allegations that, if
true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification
of the conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to
hold a hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar
facts was filed within the preceding six months;
(2) a communication from the individual subject to
conservatorship, conservator or person interested in the welfare of the
individual which supports a reasonable belief that termination or
modification of the conservatorship may be appropriate, including
because the functional needs of the individual or supports or services
available to the individual have changed;
(3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that
termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional
needs or supports or services available to the individual have changed
or a protective arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less
restrictive alternative is available; or

interest of the individual.
(e) Notice of a petition under subsection (c) or of a hearing under

proven that a basis for appointment of a conservator under section 83,
and amendments thereto, continues to exist.

the powers are excessive or inadequate due to a change in the abilities
or limitations of the individual subject to conservatorship, the
individual's supports or other circumstances.

terminating a conservatorship, the court shall follow the same
procedures to safeguard the rights of the individual subject to
conservatorship which apply to a petition for conservatorship.

terminate or modify the terms of the conservatorship has the right to

under section 93(f), and amendments thereto, or a subsequent order.
New Sec. 114. (a) A conservatorship for a minor may be extended

meeting the expected needs of the minor from the minor's 18th birthday

authorizes to be set aside or transferred from the estate are paid over to
the minor, including provisions for accelerated distribution in
extraordinary circumstances, which may require court approval.
(e) If the court orders a conservatorship for a minor to be extended

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 71
purposes of effectuating an extended distribution plan within the
conservator's next accounting.

minor's becoming 18 years of age.

involuntarily, to sell, mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, assign, alienate,

necessary expenses. Funds not applied for these purposes must be
preserved for the future support, care, education, health or welfare of
the minor, and the balance, if any, transferred to the minor when the
minor becomes an adult or otherwise is emancipated.

and amendments thereto, the deposit of the money in a savings account
of a bank, credit union, savings and loan association or any other
investment account that the court may authorize, payable either to a
conservator, if one shall be appointed for the minor, or to the minor
upon attaining 18 years of age.
(b) Any court having either control over or possession of any
amount of money not exceeding $25,000, the right to which is vested in
a minor, shall have the discretion to order the payment of the money to
any person, including the parent of the minor, or the minor. If the
person is the conservator for the minor, the court may waive or
recommend the waiver of the requirement of a bond. If the person is

restrictive alternative.

obtain or provide money needed for the support, care, education, health
or welfare of the minor.

court, instead of appointing a conservator, may:
(1) Authorize or direct a transaction necessary to protect the
financial interest or property of the respondent, including:

control caused or attempted to cause an action that would have resulted
in financial harm to the respondent or the respondent's property; and
(2) poses a serious risk of substantial financial harm to the
respondent or the respondent's property.
(e) Before issuing an order under subsection (c) or (d), the court
shall consider the factors under section 99, and amendments thereto, a
conservator must consider when making a decision on behalf of an
individual subject to conservatorship.
(f) Before issuing an order under subsection (c) or (d) for a

Sec. 144. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 58-656 is hereby amended to read as
follows: 58-656. (a) An attorney in fact who elects to act under a power
of attorney is under a duty to act in the interest of the principal and to
avoid conflicts of interest that impair the ability of the attorney in fact
so to act. A person who is appointed an attorney in fact under a power
of attorney who undertakes to exercise the authority conferred in the
power of attorney, has a fiduciary obligation to exercise the powers
conferred in the best interests of the principal, and to avoid self-dealing
and conflicts of interest, as in the case of a trustee with respect to the
trustee's beneficiary or beneficiaries. The attorney in fact shall keep a
record of receipts, disbursements and transactions made on behalf of
the principal and shall not comingle funds or assets of the principal
with the funds or assets of the attorney in fact. In the absence of explicit
authorization, the attorney in fact shall exercise a high degree of care in
maintaining, without modification, any estate plan which the principal
may have in place, including, but not limited to, arrangements made by
the principal for disposition of assets at death through beneficiary
designations, ownership by joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety,
trust arrangements or by will or codicil. Unless otherwise provided in
the power of attorney or in a separate agreement between the principal
and attorney in fact, an attorney in fact who elects to act shall exercise
the authority granted in a power of attorney with that degree of care
that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with the property
and conducting the affairs of another, except that all investments made
on or after July 1, 2003, shall be in accordance with the provisions of
the Kansas uniform prudent investor act, K.S.A. 58-24a01 et seq., and
amendments thereto. If the attorney in fact has special skills or was
appointed attorney in fact on the basis of representations of special
skills or expertise, the attorney in fact has a duty to use those skills in
the principal's behalf.
(b) On matters undertaken or to be undertaken in the principal's
behalf and to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances,
an attorney in fact has a duty to keep in regular contact with the
principal, to communicate with the principal and to obtain and follow
the instructions of the principal.
(c) If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court
of the principal's domicile appoints a conservator, guardian of the estate
or other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's
property or all of the principal's property except specified exclusions,
the attorney in fact is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the
principal. The fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the
durable power of attorney that the principal would have had if the
principal were not an adult with an impairment in need of a guardian or
conservator or both as defined by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 59-3051
section 25, and amendments thereto.
(d) A principal may nominate by a power of attorney, a guardian
or conservator, or both, for consideration by the court. If a petition to
appoint a guardian or conservator, or both, is filed, the court shall make
the appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent
nomination in the power of attorney, so long as the individual

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 91
nominated is a fit and proper person.
(e) An attorney in fact shall exercise authority granted by the
principal in accordance with the instrument setting forth the power of
attorney, any modification made therein by the principal or the
principal's legal representative or a court, and the oral and written
instructions of the principal, or the written instructions of the principal's
legal representative or a court.
(f) An attorney in fact may be instructed in a power of attorney
that the authority granted shall not be exercised until, or shall terminate
on, the happening of a future event, condition or contingency, as
determined in a manner prescribed in the instrument.
(g) On the death of the principal, the attorney in fact shall follow
the instructions of the court, if any, having jurisdiction over the estate
of the principal, or any part thereof, and shall communicate with and be
accountable to the principal's personal representative, or if none, the
principal's successors. The attorney in fact shall promptly deliver to and
put in the possession and control of the principal's personal
representative or successors, any property of the principal and copies of
any records of the attorney in fact relating to transactions undertaken in
the principal's behalf that are deemed by the personal representative or
the court to be necessary or helpful in the administration of the
decedent's estate.
(h) If an attorney in fact has a property or contract interest in the
subject of the power of attorney or the authority of the attorney in fact
is otherwise coupled with an interest in a person other than the
principal, this section does not impose any duties on the attorney in fact
that would conflict or be inconsistent with that interest.
Sec. 145. K.S.A. 58-662 is hereby amended to read as follows: 58-
662. (a) The principal may petition the court for an accounting by the
principal's attorney in fact or the legal representative of the attorney in
fact. If the principal is disabled or deceased, a petition for accounting
may be filed by the principal's legal representative, an adult member of
the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
principal.
(b) Any requirement for an accounting may be waived or an
accounting may be approved by the court without hearing, if the
accounting is waived or approved by a principal who is not disabled, or
by a principal whose legal capacity has been restored, or by all
creditors and distributees of a deceased principal's estate whose claims
or distributions theretofore have not been satisfied in full. The approval
or waiver shall be in writing, signed by the affected persons and filed
with the court.
(c) For the purposes of subsection (b), a legal representative or a
person providing services to the principal's estate shall not be
considered a creditor of the principal's estate. No express approval or
waiver shall be required from the legal representative of a disabled
principal if the principal's legal capacity has been restored, or from the
personal representative of a deceased principal's estate, or from any
other person entitled to compensation or expense for services rendered
to a disabled or deceased principal's estate, unless the principal or the
principal's estate is unable to pay in full the compensation and expense
to which the person rendering the services may be entitled.
(d) The principal, the principal's attorney in fact, an adult member
of the principal's family or any person interested in the welfare of the
principal may petition the district court in the county where the
principal is then residing to determine and declare whether a principal,
who has executed a power of attorney, is a disabled person.
(e) If the principal is a disabled person, on petition of the
principal's legal representative, an adult member of the principal's

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 92
family or any interested person, including a person interested in the
welfare of the principal, for good cause shown, the court may:
(1) Order the attorney in fact to exercise or refrain from exercising
authority in a durable power of attorney in a particular manner or for a
particular purpose;
(2) modify the authority of an attorney in fact under a durable
power of attorney;
(3) declare suspended a power of attorney that is nondurable;
(4) terminate a durable power of attorney;
(5) remove the attorney in fact under a durable power of attorney;
(6) confirm the authority of an attorney in fact or a successor
attorney in fact to act under a durable power of attorney; and
(7) issue such other orders as the court finds will be in the best
interest of the disabled principal, including appointment of a
conservator for the principal pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050, et seq. the
Kansas uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective
arrangements act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto.
(f) In addition to any other remedies available under law, if after
notice and hearing, the court determines that there has been a showing
that the principal is a disabled person and that the attorney in fact has
breached such attorney in fact's fiduciary duty to the principal or that
there is a reasonable likelihood that such attorney in fact may do so in
the immediate future, the court, in its discretion, may issue an order that
some or all of the authority granted by the durable power of attorney be
suspended or modified, and that a different attorney in fact be
authorized to exercise some or all of the powers granted by the durable
power of attorney. Such attorney in fact may be designated by the
court. The court may require any person petitioning for any such order
to file a bond in such amount and with such sureties as required by the
court to indemnify either the attorney in fact who has been acting on
behalf of the principal or the principal and the principal's successors in
interest for the expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by any such
persons with respect to such proceeding. The court, after hearing, may
allow payment or enter judgment. None of the actions described in this
subsection shall be taken by the court until after hearing upon
reasonable notice to all persons identified in a verified statement
supplied by the petitioner who is requesting such action identifying the
immediate relatives of the principal and any other persons known to the
petitioner to be interested in the welfare of the principal. Except that in
the event of an emergency as determined by the court, the court,
without notice, may enter such temporary order as seems proper to the
court, but no such temporary order shall be effective for more than 30
days unless extended by the court after hearing on reasonable notice to
the persons identified as herein provided in this subsection.
(g) If a power of attorney is suspended or terminated by the court
or the attorney in fact is removed by the court, the court may require an
accounting from the attorney in fact and order delivery of any property
belonging to the principal and copies of any necessary records of the
attorney in fact concerning the principal's property and affairs to a
successor attorney in fact or the principal's legal representative.
(h) In a proceeding under this act or in any other proceeding, or
upon petition of an attorney in fact or successor, the court may:
(1) Require or permit an attorney in fact under a power of attorney
to account;
(2) authorize the attorney in fact under a power of attorney to
enter into any transaction, or approve, ratify, confirm and validate any
transaction entered into by the attorney in fact that the court finds is,
was or will be beneficial to the principal and which the court has power
to authorize for a conservator pursuant to K.S.A. 59-3050 et seq. the

HOUSE BILL No. 2359—page 93
Kansas uniform guardianship, conservatorship and other protective
arrangements act, sections 24 through 135, and amendments thereto;
and
(3) relieve the attorney in fact of any obligation to exercise
authority for a disabled principal under a durable power of attorney.
(i) Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation,
any cause of action against an attorney in fact or successor for breach
of duty to the principal shall be barred as to any principal who has
received an account or other statement fully disclosing the matter
unless a proceeding to assert the cause of action is commenced within
two years after receipt of the account or statement by the principal or, if
the principal is a disabled person, by a guardian or conservator of the
disabled person's estate. If a disabled person has no guardian or
conservator of the disabled person's estate at the time an account or
statement is presented, then the cause of action shall not be barred until
one year after the removal of the principal's disability or incapacity, one
year after the appointment of a conservator for the principal or one year
after the death of the principal. The cause of action thus barred does not
include any action to recover from an attorney in fact or successor for
fraud, misrepresentation or concealment related to the settlement of any
transaction involving the agency relationship of the attorney in fact
with the principal.

guardian.

discharge shall be made by the child's parent or legal guardian except if
the minor was admitted upon their own written application to become a
voluntary patient made pursuant to K.S.A. 59-29b49 and amendments
thereto, then the minor may make the request. In the case of a minor 14
or more years of age who had made written application to become a
voluntary patient on their own behalf and who has requested to be
discharged, the head of the treatment facility shall promptly inform the
child's parent, legal guardian or other person known to the head of the

be injurious to the proposed patient's welfare. The order shall further

the proposed patient wishes to be present at the hearing, the proposed
patient's presence cannot be waived.

patient at all stages of the proceedings and until all orders resulting
from such proceedings are terminated. The court shall give preference,

prior representation. The proposed patient shall have the right to engage

court.

amendments thereto, sections 30, 53, 55, 66 and 70, and amendments
thereto, may be consolidated.
(8) If the petitioner shall not have named a proposed treatment
facility to which the proposed patient may be sent as provided for
subsection (b)(8) of in K.S.A. 59-29b57(b)(8), and amendments
thereto, but instead stated that the secretary for aging and disability
services has been notified and requested to determine which treatment
facility the proposed patient should be sent to, then the court shall issue
an order requiring the secretary, or the secretary's designee, to make
that determination and to notify the court of the name and address of
that treatment facility by such time as the court shall specify in the
court's order.
(b) Nothing in this section shall prevent the court from granting an
order of continuance, for good cause shown, to any party for no longer
than seven days, except that such limitation does not apply to a request
for an order of continuance made by the proposed patient or to a
request made by any party if the proposed patient is absent such that
further proceedings can not be held until the proposed patient has been
located. The court also, upon the request of any party, may advance the
