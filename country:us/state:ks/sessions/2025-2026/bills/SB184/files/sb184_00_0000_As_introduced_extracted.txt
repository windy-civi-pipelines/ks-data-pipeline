33 federal and local, including the United States environmental protection
34 agency, from becoming involved in contamination problems resulting from

40 action plan, provided, however, that reimbursement for corrective action
41 costs incurred before the effective date of this act shall be limited to
42 $100,000 per site that have received approval by the department to
43 conduct such corrective action, whether or not such corrective action is

6 used:

27 moneys from the fund are being expended whenever such postponement is
28 deemed necessary in order to make moneys available for corrective action
29 at a site with a higher priority.

34 (e) At any multisource site, the secretary is authorized to make a
35 determination of determine the relative liability of the fund for costs of
36 corrective action, expressed as a percentage of the total cost of corrective
37 action at a site, whether known or unknown. The secretary shall issue an
38 order establishing such percentage of liability. Such order shall be binding
39 and shall control the obligation of the fund until or unless amended by the
40 secretary. In the event of an appeal from such order, such percentage of

13 of the secretary, an owner may be responsible for up to 100% of the costs
14 of corrective action attributable to such the owner or operator if the
15 secretary finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance
16 with the Kansas administrative procedure act, that:
17 (1) Requiring the owner to bear such responsibility will not prejudice
18 another owner or person who is eligible, under the provisions of this act, to
19 have corrective action costs paid by the fund; and
20 (2) the owner:
21 (A) Caused a release by willful or wanton actions and such release
