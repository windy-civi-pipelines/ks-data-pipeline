3 fund. The department should discourage other units of government, both
4 federal and local, including the United States environmental protection
5 agency, from becoming involved in contamination problems resulting from

19 information or advertising the fund, responding to complaints or related

22 facilities.
23 (d) Careful consideration should be given to interim or early
24 corrective action which that may result in an overall reduction of risk to
25 human health and the environment and in the reduction of total costs of
26 corrective action at a site. Such interim or early corrective action should
27 receive consideration by the department as a high priority.
28 (e)(d)(e) The department, in its discretion, may use innovative
29 technology to perform corrective action.
30 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 65-34,148 is hereby amended to read as follows: 65-

29 used:
30 (1) For corrective action at sites that are contaminated by solvents
