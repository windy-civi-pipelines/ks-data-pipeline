39 company from subrentals. The "qualified business facility investment"
40 shall be determined by dividing by 12 the sum of the total value of such
41 property on the last business day of each calendar month of the taxable
42 year. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, for the purpose of
43 computing the credit allowed by section 3, and amendments thereto, in the
