26 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 2-1930 is hereby amended to read as follows: 2-1930.
27 (a) As used in this section:
28 (1) "Division" means the Kansas office of natural resources, division
29 of conservation established within the Kansas department of agriculture in
30 K.S.A. 74-5,126, and amendments thereto;
31 (2) "historic consumptive water use" means an amount of use of a
32 water right as calculated pursuant to subsection (k); and
33 (3) "program" means the water right transition assistance program.
34 (b) There is hereby established the water right transition assistance
35 program. The program shall be administered by the division. The Kansas
36 department of agriculture office of natural resources, division of water
37 resources and recognized local governing agencies, including groundwater
38 management districts, shall cooperate in program implementation. The
39 program shall be administered for the purpose of reducing historic
40 consumptive water use in the target or high priority areas of the state by
41 issuing water right transition grants based on competitive bids for privately
42 held water rights.
43 (c) (1) The division may receive and expend funds from the federal or
HB 2345 21
1 state government or a private source for the purpose of carrying out the
2 provisions of this section. The division shall carry over unexpended funds
3 from one fiscal year to the next.
4 (2) The maximum amount paid by the division shall not exceed a
5 base rate per acre-foot of historic consumptive water use made available
6 under the water right to be dismissed or permanently reduced. The
7 division, in consultation with the commission, shall establish an annual
8 base rate after considering recommendations from the chief engineer and
9 the groundwater management districts regarding market conditions.
10 (d) The division may enter into water right transition assistance
11 program contracts with landowners that will result in the permanent
12 reduction of part or all of a landowner's historic consumptive water use by
13 action of the chief engineer as provided for in subsection (f).
14 (e) All applications for permanent irrigation water right retirements
15 shall be considered for funding. Permanent retirement of partial water
16 rights shall only be approved by the Kansas department of agriculture
17 office of natural resources, division of water resources when the local

5 unit, surface water basin, subbasin or stream reach that the chief engineer
6 has closed to further appropriations except for domestic use, temporary
7 permits, term permits for five years or less and small-use exemptions for
8 15 acre-feet or less, if the use, permit or exemption does not conflict with
9 this program.
10 (3) The designation of each target area shall include the identification
11 of a historic consumptive water use retirement goal. When such goal is
12 reached, the target area shall be delisted.
13 (4) The designation of each target area shall include the identification
14 of sub-regions that are to be prioritized for retirements among competing
15 bids.
16 (i) Contracts accepted under the program shall result in a net
17 reduction in historic consumptive water use in the target area. Except as
18 provided for in subsections (l) and (m), once a water right transition
19 assistance program grant has been provided, the land authorized to be
20 irrigated by the water right or water rights associated with that grant shall
21 not be irrigated permanently. Water right transition assistance program
22 contracts shall be subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as may
23 be necessary to ensure that such reduction in historic consumptive water
24 use occurs and can be adequately monitored and enforced.
25 (j) Only vested or certified water rights that are in good standing shall
26 be eligible for water right retirement grants.
27 (k) (1) The historic consumptive water use of a water right shall be
28 determined by either:
29 (A) Calculating the average amount of water consumed by crops as a
30 result of the lawful beneficial use of water during the 10 preceding
31 calendar years of actual irrigation and multiplying the average reported
32 water use for the 10 selected years by a factor of 0.85 for center pivot
33 sprinkler irrigation systems, 0.75 for flood or gravity irrigation systems
34 and 0.95 for subsurface drip irrigation systems, but not to exceed the net
35 irrigation requirements for the 50% chance rainfall for the appropriate
36 county as shown in K.A.R. 5-5-12; or
37 (B) calculating the available pumping capacity of a water right by
38 multiplying a flow rate test for each point of diversion applied to be retired
39 under the water right by a theoretical pumping duration of 100 days
40 multiplied by an efficiency factor of 0.85 for center pivot sprinkler
41 irrigation systems, 0.75 for flood or gravity irrigation systems and 0.95 for
42 subsurface drop irrigation systems, but not to exceed the authorized
43 quantity of the water right or the net irrigation requirements for the 50%
HB 2345 23
1 chance rainfall for the appropriate county as shown in K.A.R. 5-5-12.
2 Flow rate tests must have been conducted not less than one year prior to
3 the application date and certified as acceptable by the local groundwater
4 management district or the chief engineer.
5 (2) The applicant may also submit an engineering study that
6 determines the average historic consumptive water use as an alternative
7 method if it is demonstrated to be more accurate for the water right or
8 water rights involved.
9 (l) Enrollment of an entire water right or a portion of a water right
10 where land associated with the quantity is being permanently reduced from
11 the water right in the program shall not subsequently prohibit irrigation of
12 the land that, prior to enrollment, was authorized by the water right or
13 water rights if irrigation can be lawfully allowed by another water right or
14 permit pursuant to the rules and regulations and consideration of any
15 future changes to other water rights that may be proposed to be transferred
16 to such land.
17 (m) If more than one water right overlaps the place of use authorized
18 by the water right proposed to be enrolled in the program, then all
19 overlapping water rights shall be enrolled in the program or the
20 landowners shall take the necessary lawful steps to eliminate the overlap
21 with the water right to be enrolled. The burden shall be on the landowner
22 to provide sufficient information to substantiate that the proposed use of
23 water by the resulting exercise of all water rights involved will result in the
24 net reduction amount of historic consumptive water use by the water right
25 or water rights to be enrolled. The division may require such
26 documentation to be provided by someone with special knowledge or
27 experience related to water rights and such operations.
28 (n) The division shall adopt rules and regulations as necessary for the
29 administration of this section. When adopting such rules and regulations,
30 the division shall consider cropping, system design, metered water use and
31 all other pertinent information that will permit a verifiable reduction in
32 historic consumptive water use and permit alternative crop or other use of
33 the land so that the landowner's economic opportunities are taken into
34 account.
35 (o) The division shall hold a meeting in each target area designated
36 after July 1, 2012, prior to entering into any water right transition
37 assistance program contract for the permanent retirement of part or all of
38 landowner water rights in such target area. Such meetings shall inform the
39 public of the possible economic and hydrologic impacts of the program.
40 The division shall provide notice of such meetings through publication in
41 local newspapers of record and in the Kansas register.

3 be adopted and implemented, the chief engineer shall give priority to: (1)
4 Water users that share a common source of supply that could be
5 insufficient during times of drought; (2) water users whose use is
6 significantly higher than their peers from the same geographical area with
7 comparable circumstances; and (3) water users who apply for any state
8 administered grant, loan or cost-share moneys for water-related projects.
9 Prior to requiring the adoption and implementation of conservation plans
10 and practices, the chief engineer shall assess the availability of technical
11 assistance and inform the owner of a water right or permit to appropriate
12 water for beneficial use or the applicant for such a permit who is required
13 to adopt and implement a conservation plan and practices of the available
14 sources of technical assistance to prepare the conservation plan.
15 (b) The chief engineer shall allow the owner of a water right or
16 permit to appropriate water for beneficial use or the applicant for such a
17 permit a minimum of 60 days to prepare a required conservation plan. The

31 water use or upon demonstration of good cause by the applicant, the chief
32 engineer may calculate the base average usage with less than all 10
33 calendar years during 2000 and 2009. In no case shall the base average
34 usage be calculated with less than five calendar years during 2000 and
35 2009; or
36 (C) if the holder of the base water right shows to the satisfaction of
37 the chief engineer that water conservation reduced water use under the

27 (a) As used in this section:
28 (1) "Division" means the Kansas office of natural resources, division
29 of conservation established within the Kansas department of agriculture in
30 K.S.A. 74-5,126, and amendments thereto;
31 (2) "historic consumptive water use" means an amount of use of a
32 water right as calculated pursuant to subsection (k); and
33 (3) "program" means the water right transition assistance program.
34 (b) There is hereby established the water right transition assistance
35 program. The program shall be administered by the division. The Kansas
36 department of agriculture office of natural resources, division of water
37 resources and recognized local governing agencies, including groundwater
38 management districts, shall cooperate in program implementation. The
39 program shall be administered for the purpose of reducing historic
40 consumptive water use in the target or high priority areas of the state by
41 issuing water right transition grants based on competitive bids for privately
42 held water rights.
43 (c) (1) The division may receive and expend funds from the federal or

HB 2345 21
1 state government or a private source for the purpose of carrying out the
2 provisions of this section. The division shall carry over unexpended funds
3 from one fiscal year to the next.
4 (2) The maximum amount paid by the division shall not exceed a
5 base rate per acre-foot of historic consumptive water use made available
6 under the water right to be dismissed or permanently reduced. The
7 division, in consultation with the commission, shall establish an annual
8 base rate after considering recommendations from the chief engineer and
9 the groundwater management districts regarding market conditions.
10 (d) The division may enter into water right transition assistance
11 program contracts with landowners that will result in the permanent
12 reduction of part or all of a landowner's historic consumptive water use by
13 action of the chief engineer as provided for in subsection (f).
14 (e) All applications for permanent irrigation water right retirements
15 shall be considered for funding. Permanent retirement of partial water
16 rights shall only be approved by the Kansas department of agriculture

5 unit, surface water basin, subbasin or stream reach that the chief engineer
6 has closed to further appropriations except for domestic use, temporary
7 permits, term permits for five years or less and small-use exemptions for
8 15 acre-feet or less, if the use, permit or exemption does not conflict with
9 this program.
10 (3) The designation of each target area shall include the identification
11 of a historic consumptive water use retirement goal. When such goal is
12 reached, the target area shall be delisted.
13 (4) The designation of each target area shall include the identification
14 of sub-regions that are to be prioritized for retirements among competing
15 bids.
16 (i) Contracts accepted under the program shall result in a net
17 reduction in historic consumptive water use in the target area. Except as
18 provided for in subsections (l) and (m), once a water right transition
19 assistance program grant has been provided, the land authorized to be
20 irrigated by the water right or water rights associated with that grant shall
21 not be irrigated permanently. Water right transition assistance program
22 contracts shall be subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as may
23 be necessary to ensure that such reduction in historic consumptive water
24 use occurs and can be adequately monitored and enforced.
25 (j) Only vested or certified water rights that are in good standing shall
26 be eligible for water right retirement grants.
27 (k) (1) The historic consumptive water use of a water right shall be
28 determined by either:
29 (A) Calculating the average amount of water consumed by crops as a
30 result of the lawful beneficial use of water during the 10 preceding
31 calendar years of actual irrigation and multiplying the average reported
32 water use for the 10 selected years by a factor of 0.85 for center pivot
33 sprinkler irrigation systems, 0.75 for flood or gravity irrigation systems
34 and 0.95 for subsurface drip irrigation systems, but not to exceed the net
35 irrigation requirements for the 50% chance rainfall for the appropriate
36 county as shown in K.A.R. 5-5-12; or
37 (B) calculating the available pumping capacity of a water right by
38 multiplying a flow rate test for each point of diversion applied to be retired
39 under the water right by a theoretical pumping duration of 100 days
40 multiplied by an efficiency factor of 0.85 for center pivot sprinkler
41 irrigation systems, 0.75 for flood or gravity irrigation systems and 0.95 for
42 subsurface drop irrigation systems, but not to exceed the authorized
43 quantity of the water right or the net irrigation requirements for the 50%

HB 2345 23
1 chance rainfall for the appropriate county as shown in K.A.R. 5-5-12.
2 Flow rate tests must have been conducted not less than one year prior to
3 the application date and certified as acceptable by the local groundwater
4 management district or the chief engineer.
5 (2) The applicant may also submit an engineering study that
6 determines the average historic consumptive water use as an alternative
7 method if it is demonstrated to be more accurate for the water right or
8 water rights involved.
9 (l) Enrollment of an entire water right or a portion of a water right
10 where land associated with the quantity is being permanently reduced from
11 the water right in the program shall not subsequently prohibit irrigation of
12 the land that, prior to enrollment, was authorized by the water right or
13 water rights if irrigation can be lawfully allowed by another water right or
14 permit pursuant to the rules and regulations and consideration of any
15 future changes to other water rights that may be proposed to be transferred
16 to such land.
17 (m) If more than one water right overlaps the place of use authorized
18 by the water right proposed to be enrolled in the program, then all
19 overlapping water rights shall be enrolled in the program or the
20 landowners shall take the necessary lawful steps to eliminate the overlap
21 with the water right to be enrolled. The burden shall be on the landowner
22 to provide sufficient information to substantiate that the proposed use of
23 water by the resulting exercise of all water rights involved will result in the
24 net reduction amount of historic consumptive water use by the water right
25 or water rights to be enrolled. The division may require such
26 documentation to be provided by someone with special knowledge or
27 experience related to water rights and such operations.
28 (n) The division shall adopt rules and regulations as necessary for the
29 administration of this section. When adopting such rules and regulations,
30 the division shall consider cropping, system design, metered water use and
31 all other pertinent information that will permit a verifiable reduction in
32 historic consumptive water use and permit alternative crop or other use of
33 the land so that the landowner's economic opportunities are taken into
34 account.
35 (o) The division shall hold a meeting in each target area designated
36 after July 1, 2012, prior to entering into any water right transition
37 assistance program contract for the permanent retirement of part or all of
38 landowner water rights in such target area. Such meetings shall inform the
39 public of the possible economic and hydrologic impacts of the program.
40 The division shall provide notice of such meetings through publication in
41 local newspapers of record and in the Kansas register.

31 water use or upon demonstration of good cause by the applicant, the chief
32 engineer may calculate the base average usage with less than all 10
33 calendar years during 2000 and 2009. In no case shall the base average
34 usage be calculated with less than five calendar years during 2000 and
35 2009; or
36 (C) if the holder of the base water right shows to the satisfaction of
37 the chief engineer that water conservation reduced water use under the
