30 consecutive hours of imprisonment, the remainder of the period of
31 confinement may be served by a combination of: Imprisonment; a work
32 release program, if such work release program requires such person to
33 return to the confinement at the end of each day in the work release
34 program; or a house arrest program pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6609, and
35 amendments thereto; and
36 (ii) (a) if the person is placed into a work release program or placed

7 the custody of the secretary of corrections in a facility designated by the
8 secretary for the provision of substance abuse treatment pursuant to the
9 provisions of K.S.A. 21-6804, and amendments thereto. The secretary of
10 corrections may refuse to admit the person to the designated facility and
11 place the person in a different state facility, or admit the person and

13 determines: (i) That substance abuse treatment resources or the capacity of
14 the facility designated by the secretary for the incarceration and treatment
15 of the person is not available; (ii) the person has failed to meaningfully
16 participate in the treatment program of the designated facility; (iii) the
17 person is disruptive to the security or operation of the designated facility;
18 or (iv) the medical or mental health condition of the person renders the
19 person unsuitable for confinement at the designated facility. The
20 determination by the secretary that the person either is not to be admitted
21 into the designated facility or is to be transferred from the designated
22 facility is not subject to review.
23 (B) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), for any
24 conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(D) or (b)(1)(E), if the person is
25 granted probation, the court shall determine whether the person shall be
26 supervised by community correctional services or court services based on
27 the risk and needs of the person. The risk and needs of the person shall be
28 determined by use of a risk assessment tool specified by the Kansas
29 sentencing commission. During the probation supervision, the person shall
30 be required to participate in a multidisciplinary model of services for
31 substance use disorders facilitated by a Kansas department for aging and
32 disability services designated care coordination agency to include
33 assessment and, if appropriate, referral to a community based substance
34 use disorder treatment including recovery management and mental health
35 counseling as needed. The multidisciplinary team shall include the
36 designated care coordination agency, the supervision officer, the Kansas
37 department for aging and disability services designated treatment provider
38 and the person.
39 (3) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), for any
40 conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(C), at the time of the filing of the

42 and amendments thereto, the court shall cause a certified copy to be sent to
43 the officer having the person in charge. The court shall determine whether
SB 294 36
1 the person, upon release from imprisonment, shall be supervised by
2 community correctional services or court services based upon the risk and
3 needs of the person. The risk and needs of the person shall be determined
4 by use of a risk assessment tool specified by the Kansas sentencing
5 commission. The law enforcement agency maintaining custody and control
6 of a person for imprisonment shall cause a certified copy of the judgment
7 form or journal entry to be sent to the supervision office designated by the
8 court and upon expiration of the term of imprisonment shall deliver the
9 person to a location designated by the supervision office designated by the
10 court. After the term of imprisonment imposed by the court, the person
11 shall be placed on supervision to community correctional services or court
12 services, as determined by the court, for a mandatory one-year period of
13 supervision, which such period of supervision shall not be reduced. During
14 such supervision, the person shall be required to participate in a
15 multidisciplinary model of services for substance use disorders facilitated
16 by a Kansas department for aging and disability services designated care
17 coordination agency to include assessment and, if appropriate, referral to a
18 community based substance use disorder treatment including recovery
19 management and mental health counseling as needed. The
20 multidisciplinary team shall include the designated care coordination
21 agency, the supervision officer, the Kansas department for aging and
22 disability services designated treatment provider and the person. A person
23 for whom a warrant has been issued by the court alleging a violation of
24 this supervision shall be considered a fugitive from justice if it is found
25 that the warrant cannot be served. If it is found that the person has violated
26 the provisions of this supervision, the court shall determine whether the
27 time from the issuing of the warrant to the date of the court's determination
28 of an alleged violation, or any part of it, shall be counted as time served on
29 supervision. Any violation of the conditions of such supervision may
30 subject such person to revocation of supervision and imprisonment in jail
31 for the remainder of the period of imprisonment, the remainder of the
32 supervision period, or any combination or portion thereof. The term of
33 supervision may be extended at the court's discretion beyond one year, and
34 any violation of the conditions of such extended term of supervision may
35 subject such person to the revocation of supervision and imprisonment in
36 jail of up to the remainder of the original sentence, not the term of the
37 extended supervision.
38 (4) In addition to the provisions of subsection (b)(1), prior to
39 sentencing for any conviction pursuant to subsection (b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)
40 (B), the court shall order the person to participate in an alcohol and drug
41 evaluation conducted by a provider in accordance with K.S.A. 8-1008, and
42 amendments thereto. The person shall be required to follow any
43 recommendation made by the provider after such evaluation, unless
SB 294 37
1 otherwise ordered by the court.
2 (c) Any person 18 years of age or older convicted of violating this
3 section or an ordinance which prohibits the acts that this section prohibits
4 who had one or more children under the age of 18 years in the vehicle at
5 the time of the offense shall have such person's punishment enhanced by
6 one month of imprisonment. This imprisonment must be served
7 consecutively to any other minimum mandatory penalty imposed for a
8 violation of this section or an ordinance which prohibits the acts that this
9 section prohibits. Any enhanced penalty imposed shall not exceed the
10 maximum sentence allowable by law. During the service of the enhanced
11 penalty, the judge may order the person on house arrest, work release or
12 other conditional release.
13 (d) (1) If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (a)(4) or
14 (a)(5), the fact that the person is or has been entitled to use the drug under
15 the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against the charge.
16 (2) The fact that a person tests positive for the presence of cannabis
17 metabolites shall not constitute a violation of subsection (a)(4) or (a)(5).
18 (e) The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any
19 fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section. Any
20 assessment and costs shall be required to be paid not later than 90 days
21 after imposed, and any remainder of the fine shall be paid prior to the final
22 release of the person by the court.
23 (f) (1) In lieu of payment of a fine imposed pursuant to this section,
24 the court may order that the person perform community service specified
25 by the court. The person shall receive a credit on the fine imposed in an
26 amount equal to $5 for each full hour spent by the person in the specified
27 community service. The community service ordered by the court shall be
28 required to be performed not later than one year after the fine is imposed
29 or by an earlier date specified by the court. If by the required date the
30 person performs an insufficient amount of community service to reduce to
31 zero the portion of the fine required to be paid by the person, the
32 remaining balance of the fine shall become due on that date.
33 (2) The court may, in its discretion, waive any portion of a fine
34 imposed pursuant to this section, except the $250 required to be remitted
35 to the state treasurer pursuant to subsection (q)(2), upon a showing that the
36 person successfully completed court-ordered education or treatment.
37 (g) Prior to filing a complaint alleging a violation of this section, a
38 prosecutor shall request and shall receive from the:

3 section to the division including any finding regarding the alcohol
4 concentration in the person's blood or breath. Prior to sentencing under the
5 provisions of this section, the court shall request and shall receive from the
6 division a record of all prior convictions obtained against such person for
7 any violations of any of the motor vehicle laws of this state.
8 (i) For the purpose of determining whether a conviction is a first,
9 second, third, fourth or subsequent conviction in sentencing under this
10 section:
11 (1) Convictions for a violation of this section, or a violation of an
12 ordinance of any city or resolution of any county that prohibits the acts
13 that this section prohibits, or entering into a diversion agreement in lieu of
14 further criminal proceedings on a complaint alleging any such violations,
15 shall be taken into account, but only convictions or diversions occurring
16 on or after July 1, 2001. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as
17 preventing any court from considering any convictions or diversions
18 occurring during the person's lifetime in determining the sentence to be
19 imposed within the limits provided for a first, second, third, fourth or
20 subsequent offense;
21 (2) any convictions for a violation of the following sections occurring

33 repeal, or vehicular battery, K.S.A. 21-3405b, prior to its repeal, if the
34 crime was committed while committing a violation of K.S.A. 8-1567, and
35 amendments thereto;
36 (3) "conviction" includes:

41 resolution of a county in this state or any law of another jurisdiction that
42 would constitute an offense that is comparable to the offense described in
43 subsection (i)(1) or (i)(2);
SB 294 39
1 (4) multiple convictions of any crime described in subsection (i)(1) or

9 (j) For the purposes of determining whether an offense is comparable,
10 the following shall be considered:
11 (1) The name of the out-of-jurisdiction offense;
12 (2) the elements of the out-of-jurisdiction offense; and
13 (3) whether the out-of-jurisdiction offense prohibits similar conduct
14 to the conduct prohibited by the closest approximate Kansas offense.
15 (k) Upon conviction of a person of a violation of this section or a
16 violation of a city ordinance or county resolution prohibiting the acts
17 prohibited by this section, the division, upon receiving a report of
18 conviction, shall suspend, restrict or suspend and restrict the person's
19 driving privileges as provided by K.S.A. 8-1014, and amendments thereto.
20 (l) (1) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as
21 preventing any city from enacting ordinances, or any county from adopting

23 unlawful or prohibited in such city or county and prescribing penalties for
24 violation thereof.
25 (2) The minimum penalty prescribed by any such ordinance or
26 resolution shall not be less than the minimum penalty prescribed by this
27 section for the same violation, and the maximum penalty in any such
28 ordinance or resolution shall not exceed the maximum penalty prescribed
29 for the same violation.
30 (3) On and after July 1, 2007, and retroactive for ordinance violations
31 committed on or after July 1, 2006, an ordinance may grant to a municipal
32 court jurisdiction over a violation of such ordinance which is concurrent
33 with the jurisdiction of the district court over a violation of this section,
34 notwithstanding that the elements of such ordinance violation are the same
35 as the elements of a violation of this section that would constitute, and be
36 punished as, a felony.

4 history record information concerning such person.
5 (2) If the elements of such ordinance violation are the same as the
6 elements of a violation of this section that would constitute, and be
7 punished as, a felony, the city attorney shall refer the violation to the
8 appropriate county or district attorney for prosecution.
9 (n) No plea bargaining agreement shall be entered into nor shall any
10 judge approve a plea bargaining agreement entered into for the purpose of
11 permitting a person charged with a violation of this section, or a violation
12 of any ordinance of a city or resolution of any county in this state which
13 prohibits the acts prohibited by this section, to avoid the mandatory
14 penalties established by this section or by the ordinance. For the purpose
15 of this subsection, entering into a diversion agreement pursuant to K.S.A.
16 12-4413 et seq. or 22-2906 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall not
17 constitute plea bargaining. This subsection shall not be construed to
18 prohibit an amendment or dismissal of any charge where the admissible
19 evidence is not sufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable
20 doubt on such charge.
21 (o) The alternatives set out in subsection (a) may be pleaded in the

11 that the inmate can be released without detriment to the community or to
12 the inmate; or (2) the secretary of corrections has reported to the board in
13 writing that the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required
14 by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments

36 amendments thereto. If notification is not given to such victim or such
37 victim's family in the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
38 a class A felony, the board shall postpone a decision on parole of the
39 inmate to a time at least 30 days after notification is given as provided in
40 this section. Nothing in this section shall create a cause of action against
41 the state or an employee of the state acting within the scope of the
42 employee's employment as a result of the failure to notify pursuant to this
43 section. If granted parole, the inmate may be released on parole on the date
SB 294 63
1 specified by the board, but not earlier than the date the inmate is eligible
2 for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At each parole hearing and, if
3 parole is not granted, at such intervals thereafter as it determines
4 appropriate, the board shall consider: (1) Whether the inmate has
5 satisfactorily completed the programs required by any agreement entered
6 under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, or any revision of such
7 agreement; and (2) all pertinent information regarding such inmate,
8 including, but not limited to, the circumstances of the offense of the
9 inmate; the presentence report; the previous social history and criminal
10 record of the inmate; the conduct, employment, and attitude of the inmate
11 in prison; the reports of such physical and mental examinations as have
12 been made, including, but not limited to, risk factors revealed by any risk
13 assessment of the inmate; comments of the victim and the victim's family
14 including in person comments, contemporaneous comments and
15 prerecorded comments made by any technological means; comments of
16 the public; official comments; any recommendation by the staff of the
17 facility where the inmate is incarcerated; proportionality of the time the
18 inmate has served to the sentence a person would receive under the Kansas
19 sentencing guidelines for the conduct that resulted in the inmate's
20 incarceration; and capacity of state correctional institutions.
21 (i) In those cases involving inmates sentenced for a crime committed
22 after July 1, 1993, the prisoner review board will review the inmate's
23 proposed release plan. The board may schedule a hearing if they desire.
24 The board may impose any condition they deem necessary to insure public
25 safety, aid in the reintegration of the inmate into the community, or items
26 not completed under the agreement entered into under K.S.A. 75-5210a,
27 and amendments thereto. The board may not advance or delay an inmate's
28 release date. Every inmate while on postrelease supervision shall remain in
29 the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders
30 of the secretary.
31 (j) (1) Before ordering the parole of any inmate, the prisoner review
32 board shall have the inmate appear either in person or via a video
33 conferencing format and shall interview the inmate unless impractical
34 because of the inmate's physical or mental condition or absence from the
35 institution. Every inmate while on parole shall remain in the legal custody
36 of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary.
37 Whenever the board formally considers placing an inmate on parole and
38 no agreement has been entered into with the inmate under K.S.A. 75-
39 5210a, and amendments thereto, the board shall notify the inmate in
40 writing of the reasons for not granting parole. If an agreement has been
41 entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the inmate
42 has not satisfactorily completed the programs specified in the agreement,
43 or any revision of such agreement, the board shall notify the inmate in
SB 294 64
1 writing of the specific programs the inmate must satisfactorily complete
2 before parole will be granted. If parole is not granted only because of a
3 failure to satisfactorily complete such programs, the board shall grant
4 parole upon the secretary's certification that the inmate has successfully
5 completed such programs. If an agreement has been entered under K.S.A.
6 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the secretary of corrections has
7 reported to the board in writing that the inmate has satisfactorily
8 completed the programs required by such agreement, or any revision
9 thereof, the board shall not require further program participation.
10 However, if the board determines that other pertinent information
11 regarding the inmate warrants the inmate's not being released on parole,
12 the board shall state in writing the reasons for not granting the parole. If
13 parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a crime other than a class A or
14 class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole
15 hearing for the inmate not later than one year after the denial unless the
16 board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted
17 at a hearing if held in the next three years or during the interim period of a
18 deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for
19 up to three years but any such deferral by the board shall require the board
20 to state the basis for its findings. If parole is denied for an inmate
21 sentenced for a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board
22 shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than three years
23 after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect
24 that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next 10 years or
25 during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer
26 subsequent parole hearings for up to 10 years, but any such deferral shall
27 require the board to state the basis for its findings.
28 (2) Inmates sentenced for a class A or class B felony who have not
29 had a board hearing in the five years prior to July 1, 2010, shall have such
30 inmates' cases reviewed by the board on or before July 1, 2012. Such
31 review shall begin with the inmates with the oldest deferral date and
32 progress to the most recent. Such review shall be done utilizing existing
33 resources unless the board determines that such resources are insufficient.
34 If the board determines that such resources are insufficient, then the
35 provisions of this paragraph are subject to appropriations therefor.
36 (k) (1) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision shall be
37 assigned, upon release, to the appropriate level of supervision pursuant to
38 the criteria established by the secretary of corrections.
39 (2) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
40 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
41 effects, vehicle, residence and property by a parole officer or a department
42 of corrections enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any
43 time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or
SB 294 65
1 without cause. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize
2 such officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the
3 sole purpose of harassment.
4 (3) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
5 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
6 effects, vehicle, residence and property by any law enforcement officer
7 based on reasonable suspicion of the person violating conditions of parole
8 or postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Any
9 law enforcement officer who conducts such a search shall submit a written
10 report to the appropriate parole officer no later than the close of the next
11 business day after such search. The written report shall include the facts
12 leading to such search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting
13 from such search.
14 (l) The prisoner review board shall promulgate rules and regulations
15 in accordance with K.S.A. 77-415 et seq., and amendments thereto, not
16 inconsistent with the law and as it may deem proper or necessary, with
17 respect to the conduct of parole hearings, postrelease supervision reviews,
18 revocation hearings, orders of restitution, reimbursement of expenditures
19 by the state board of indigents' defense services and other conditions to be
20 imposed upon parolees or releasees. Whenever an order for parole or
21 postrelease supervision is issued it shall recite the conditions thereof.
22 (m) Whenever the prisoner review board orders the parole of an
23 inmate or establishes conditions for an inmate placed on postrelease
24 supervision, the board shall require that the inmate:
25 (1) Obey all laws and ordinances and report any law enforcement
26 contact to the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after such
27 contact;
28 (2) not engage in physical violence or threats of violence of any kind
29 and, if the inmate is being supervised for conviction of a felony, not
30 purchase or possess a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, while on
31 supervision;
32 (3) report to the inmate's supervision officer as directed and be
33 truthful in all matters;
34 (4) remain within the state of Kansas or other specified areas as
35 defined by the defendant's supervision officer;
36 (5) reside at the inmate's approved residence unless the defendant
37 receives permission from the inmate's supervision officer to relocate and
38 notify the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after any emergency
39 changes in residence or contact information;
40 (6) not possess, use or distribute any controlled substances except
41 those prescribed by a licensed medical professional;
42 (7) not possess or consume any form of alcohol or intoxicating
43 substance or enter any establishment where alcohol is sold or consumed as

3 the inmate's supervision officer and not alter or tamper with the specimen

8 residence and property by a parole officer or a department of corrections
9 enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any time of the day
10 or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause,
11 except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize such
12 officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the sole
13 purpose of harassment;
14 (11) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
15 residence and property by any law enforcement officer based on

17 postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity;
18 (12) refrain from contacting victims unless authorized by the board to
19 contact a victim as part of rehabilitative or therapeutic purposes;
20 (13) pay the administrative fee imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 22-4529,
21 and amendments thereto, unless the board finds compelling circumstances
22 that would render payment unworkable; and
23 (14) unless the board finds compelling circumstances that would
24 render a plan of payment unworkable, reimburse the state for all or part of
25 the expenditures by the state board of indigents' defense services to
26 provide counsel and other defense services to the person. In determining
27 the amount and method of payment of such sum, the prisoner review board
28 shall take account of the financial resources of the person and the nature of
29 the burden that the payment of such sum will impose. Such amount shall
30 not exceed the amount claimed by appointed counsel on the payment
31 voucher for indigents' defense services or the amount prescribed by the
32 board of indigents' defense services reimbursement tables as provided in
33 K.S.A. 22-4522, and amendments thereto, whichever is less, minus any
34 previous payments for such services.
35 (n) Any law enforcement officer who conducts a search pursuant to
36 subsection (m)(11) shall submit a written report to the inmate's parole
37 officer not later than the close of business the next day after such search is
38 conducted. The written report shall include the facts leading to such
39 search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting from such
40 search.
41 (o) If the court that sentenced an inmate specified at the time of
42 sentencing the amount and the recipient of any restitution ordered as a
43 condition of parole or postrelease supervision, the prisoner review board
SB 294 67
1 shall order as a condition of parole or postrelease supervision that the
2 inmate pay restitution in the amount and manner provided in the journal
3 entry unless the board finds compelling circumstances that would render a
4 plan of restitution unworkable.
5 (p) Whenever the prisoner review board grants the parole of an
6 inmate, the board, within 14 days of the date of the decision to grant
7 parole, shall give written notice of the decision to the county or district
8 attorney of the county where the inmate was sentenced.
9 (q) When an inmate is to be released on postrelease supervision, the

11 district attorney of the county where the inmate was sentenced written
12 notice of the release date.
13 (r) Inmates shall be released on postrelease supervision upon the

15 postrelease supervision will vest.
16 (s) An inmate who is allocated regular good time credits as provided
17 in K.S.A. 22-3725, and amendments thereto, may receive meritorious
18 good time credits in increments of not more than 90 days per meritorious

20 inmate has acted in a heroic or outstanding manner in coming to the
21 assistance of another person in a life-threatening situation, preventing
22 injury or death to a person, preventing the destruction of property or taking
23 actions that result in a financial savings to the state.

4 Sec. 58. K.S.A. 23-3201 is hereby amended to read as follows: 23-
5 3201. (a) The court shall determine legal custody, residency and parenting
6 time of a child in accordance with the best interests of the child.
7 (b) The court shall not consider the fact that a parent consumes
8 medical cannabis or medical cannabis products, as defined in section 2,
9 and amendments thereto, in accordance with the Kansas medical cannabis
10 act, section 1 et seq., and amendments thereto, when determining the legal
11 custody, residency or parenting time of a child.
12 Sec. 59. K.S.A. 38-2269 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
13 2269. (a) When the child has been adjudicated to be a child in need of
14 care, the court may terminate parental rights or appoint a permanent
15 custodian when the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the
16 parent is unfit by reason of conduct or condition which renders the parent
17 unable to care properly for a child and the conduct or condition is unlikely
18 to change in the foreseeable future.
19 (b) In making a determination of unfitness the court shall consider,
20 but is not limited to, the following, if applicable:
21 (1) Emotional illness, mental illness, mental deficiency or physical
22 disability of the parent, of such duration or nature as to render the parent
23 unable to care for the ongoing physical, mental and emotional needs of the
24 child;
25 (2) conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally or sexually
26 cruel or abusive nature;
27 (3) the use of intoxicating liquors or narcotic or dangerous drugs of
28 such duration or nature as to render the parent unable to care for the
29 ongoing physical, mental or emotional needs of the child, except that the
30 use of medical cannabis or medical cannabis products, as defined in
31 section 2, and amendments thereto, in accordance with the Kansas
32 medical cannabis act, section 1 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall not
33 be considered to render the parent unable to care for the ongoing physical,
34 mental or emotional needs of the child;
35 (4) physical, mental or emotional abuse or neglect or sexual abuse of
36 a child;
37 (5) conviction of a felony and imprisonment;
38 (6) unexplained injury or death of another child or stepchild of the
39 parent or any child in the care of the parent at the time of injury or death;
40 (7) failure of reasonable efforts made by appropriate public or private
41 agencies to rehabilitate the family;
42 (8) lack of effort on the part of the parent to adjust the parent's
43 circumstances, conduct or conditions to meet the needs of the child; and
SB 294 76
1 (9) whether, as a result of the actions or inactions attributable to the
2 parent and one or more of the factors listed in subsection (c) apply, the
3 child has been in the custody of the secretary and placed with neither
4 parent for 15 of the most recent 22 months beginning 60 days after the
5 date on which a child in the secretary's custody was removed from the
6 child's home.
7 (c) In addition to the foregoing, when a child is not in the physical
8 custody of a parent, the court, shall consider, but is not limited to, the
9 following:
10 (1) Failure to assure care of the child in the parental home when able
11 to do so;
12 (2) failure to maintain regular visitation, contact or communication
13 with the child or with the custodian of the child;
14 (3) failure to carry out a reasonable plan approved by the court
15 directed toward the integration of the child into a parental home; and
16 (4) failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of substitute
17 physical care and maintenance based on ability to pay.
18 In making the above determination, the court may disregard incidental
19 visitations, contacts, communications or contributions.
20 (d) A finding of unfitness may be made as provided in this section if
21 the court finds that the parents have abandoned the child, the custody of
22 the child was surrendered pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2282, and amendments
23 thereto, or the child was left under such circumstances that the identity of
24 the parents is unknown and cannot be ascertained, despite diligent
25 searching, and the parents have not come forward to claim the child within
26 three months after the child is found.
27 (e) If a person is convicted of a felony in which sexual intercourse
28 occurred, or if a juvenile is adjudicated a juvenile offender because of an
29 act which, if committed by an adult, would be a felony in which sexual
30 intercourse occurred, and as a result of the sexual intercourse, a child is
31 conceived, a finding of unfitness may be made.
32 (f) The existence of any one of the above factors standing alone may,
33 but does not necessarily, establish grounds for termination of parental
34 rights.
35 (g) (1) If the court makes a finding of unfitness, the court shall
36 consider whether termination of parental rights as requested in the petition
37 or motion is in the best interests of the child. In making the determination,
38 the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental and
39 emotional health of the child. If the physical, mental or emotional needs of
40 the child would best be served by termination of parental rights, the court
41 shall so order. A termination of parental rights under the code shall not
42 terminate the right of a child to inherit from or through a parent. Upon
43 such termination all rights of the parent to such child, including, such
SB 294 77
1 parent's right to inherit from or through such child, shall cease.
2 (2) If the court terminates parental rights, the court may authorize
3 adoption pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2270, and amendments thereto,
4 appointment of a permanent custodian pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2272, and
5 amendments thereto, or continued permanency planning.
6 (3) If the court does not terminate parental rights, the court may
7 authorize appointment of a permanent custodian pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
8 2272, and amendments thereto, or continued permanency planning.
9 (h) If a parent is convicted of an offense as provided in K.S.A. 38-
10 2271(a)(7), and amendments thereto, or is adjudicated a juvenile offender
11 because of an act which if committed by an adult would be an offense as
12 provided in K.S.A. 38-2271(a)(7), and amendments thereto, and if the
13 victim was the other parent of a child, the court may disregard such
14 convicted or adjudicated parent's opinions or wishes in regard to the
15 placement of such child.
16 (i) A record shall be made of the proceedings.
17 (j) When adoption, proceedings to appoint a permanent custodian or
18 continued permanency planning has been authorized, the person or agency
19 awarded custody of the child shall within 30 days submit a written plan for
20 permanent placement which shall include measurable objectives and time
21 schedules.
22 Sec. 60. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 44-501 is hereby amended to read as
23 follows: 44-501. (a) (1) Compensation for an injury shall be disallowed if
24 such injury to the employee results from:
25 (A) The employee's deliberate intention to cause such injury;
26 (B) the employee's willful failure to use a guard or protection against
27 accident or injury which is required pursuant to any statute and provided
28 for the employee;
29 (C) the employee's willful failure to use a reasonable and proper
30 guard and protection voluntarily furnished the employee by the employer;
31 (D) the employee's reckless violation of their employer's workplace
32 safety rules or regulations; or
33 (E) the employee's voluntary participation in fighting or horseplay
34 with a co-employee for any reason, work related or otherwise.
35 (2) Subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection
36 (a)Subsections (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) shall not apply when it was
37 reasonable under the totality of the circumstances to not use such
38 equipment, or if the employer approved the work engaged in at the time of
39 an accident or injury to be performed without such equipment.
40 (b) (1) (A) The employer shall not be liable under the workers
41 compensation act where the injury, disability or death was contributed to
42 by the employee's use or consumption of alcohol or any drugs, chemicals
43 or any other compounds or substances, including, but not limited to, any
SB 294 78
1 drugs or medications which that are available to the public without a
2 prescription from a healthcare provider, prescription drugs or medications,
3 any form or type of narcotic drugs, marijuana, stimulants, depressants or
4 hallucinogens.
5 (B) (i) In the case of drugs or medications which are available to the
6 public without a prescription from a healthcare provider and prescription
7 drugs or medications, compensation shall not be denied if the employee
8 can show that such drugs or medications were being taken or used in
9 therapeutic doses and there have been no prior incidences of the
10 employee's impairment on the job as the result of the use of such drugs or
11 medications within the previous 24 months.
12 (ii) In the case of cannabis, including any cannabis derivatives,
13 compensation shall not be denied if the employee has been issued a valid
14 identification card pursuant to the Kansas medical cannabis act, section 1
15 et seq., and amendments thereto, such cannabis or cannabis derivative
16 was used in accordance with such act, and there has been no prior
17 incidence of the employee's impairment on the job as a result of the use of
18 such cannabis or cannabis derivative within the immediately preceding 24
19 months.
20 (C) It shall be conclusively presumed that the employee was impaired
21 due to alcohol or drugs if it is shown that, at the time of the injury, the
22 employee had an alcohol concentration of .04 or more, or a GCMS
23 confirmatory test by quantitative analysis showing a concentration at or
24 above the levels shown on the following chart for the drugs of abuse listed:
25 Confirmatory

41 than or equal to 200 ng/ml.
42 4 Test for 6-AM when morphine concentration exceeds 2,000 ng/ml.
43 (D) If it is shown that the employee was impaired pursuant to
SB 294 79
1 subsection (b)(1)(C) at the time of the injury, there shall be a rebuttable
2 presumption that the accident, injury, disability or death was contributed to
3 by such impairment. The employee may overcome the presumption of
4 contribution by clear and convincing evidence.
5 (E) An employee's refusal to submit to a chemical test at the request
6 of the employer shall result in the forfeiture of benefits under the workers
7 compensation act if the employer had sufficient cause to suspect the use of
8 alcohol or drugs by the claimant or if the employer's policy clearly
9 authorizes post-injury testing.
10 (2) The results of a chemical test shall be admissible evidence to
11 prove impairment if the employer establishes that the testing was done
12 under any of the following circumstances:
13 (A) As a result of an employer mandated drug testing policy, in place
14 in writing prior to the date of accident or injury, requiring any worker to
15 submit to testing for drugs or alcohol;
16 (B) during an autopsy or in the normal course of medical treatment
17 for reasons related to the health and welfare of the injured worker and not
18 at the direction of the employer;
19 (C) the worker, prior to the date and time of the accident or injury,
20 gave written consent to the employer that the worker would voluntarily
21 submit to a chemical test for drugs or alcohol following any accident or
22 injury;
23 (D) the worker voluntarily agrees to submit to a chemical test for
24 drugs or alcohol following any accident or injury; or
25 (E) as a result of federal or state law or a federal or state rule or
26 regulation having the force and effect of law requiring a post-injury testing
27 program and such required program was properly implemented at the time
28 of testing.
29 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), the results of a chemical test
30 performed on a sample collected by an employer shall not be admissible
31 evidence to prove impairment unless the following conditions are met:
32 (A) The test sample was collected within a reasonable time following
33 the accident or injury;
34 (B) the collecting and labeling of the test sample was performed by or
35 under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional;
36 (C) the test was performed by a laboratory approved by the United
37 States department of health and human services or licensed by the
38 department of health and environment, except that a blood sample may be
39 tested for alcohol content by a laboratory commonly used for that purpose
40 by state law enforcement agencies;
41 (D) the test was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass
42 spectroscopy or other comparably reliable analytical method, except that
43 no such confirmation is required for a blood alcohol sample;
SB 294 80
1 (E) the foundation evidence must establish, beyond a reasonable
2 doubt, that the test results were from the sample taken from the employee;
3 and
4 (F) a split sample sufficient for testing shall be retained and made
5 available to the employee within 48 hours of a positive test.
6 (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), compensation shall not
7 be paid in case of coronary or coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular
8 injury unless it is shown that the exertion of the work necessary to
9 precipitate the disability was more than the employee's usual work in the
10 course of the employee's regular employment.
11 (2) For events occurring on or after July 1, 2014, in the case of a
12 firefighter as defined by K.S.A. 40-1709(b)(1), and amendments thereto,
13 or a law enforcement officer as defined by K.S.A. 74-5602, and
14 amendments thereto, coronary or coronary artery disease or
15 cerebrovascular injury shall be compensable if:
16 (A) The injury can be identified as caused by a specific event
17 occurring in the course and scope of employment;
18 (B) the coronary or cerebrovascular injury occurred within 24 hours
19 of the specific event; and
20 (C) the specific event was the prevailing factor in causing the
21 coronary or coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular injury.
22 (d) Except as provided in the workers compensation act, no
23 construction design professional who is retained to perform professional
24 services on a construction project or any employee of a construction
25 design professional who is assisting or representing the construction
26 design professional in the performance of professional services on the site
27 of the construction project, shall be liable for any injury resulting from the
28 employer's failure to comply with safety standards on the construction
29 project for which compensation is recoverable under the workers
30 compensation act, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically
31 assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any
32 construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent
33 preparation of design plans or specifications.
34 (e) An award of compensation for permanent partial impairment,
35 work disability, or permanent total disability shall be reduced by the
36 amount of functional impairment determined to be preexisting to the same
37 physical structure as the body part injured. Any such reduction shall not
38 apply to temporary total disability, nor shall it apply to compensation for
39 medical treatment.
40 (1) Where workers compensation benefits have previously been
41 awarded through settlement or judicial or administrative determination in
42 Kansas, the percentage basis of the prior settlement or award shall
43 conclusively establish the amount of functional impairment determined to
SB 294 81
1 be preexisting. Where workers compensation benefits have not previously
2 been awarded through settlement or judicial or administrative
3 determination in Kansas, the amount of preexisting functional impairment
4 shall be established by competent evidence.
5 (2) In all cases, the applicable reduction shall be calculated as
6 follows:
7 (A) If the preexisting impairment is the result of injury sustained
8 while working for the employer against whom workers compensation
9 benefits are currently being sought, any award of compensation shall be
10 reduced by the current dollar value attributable under the workers
11 compensation act to the percentage of functional impairment determined to
12 be preexisting. The "current dollar value" shall be calculated by
13 multiplying the percentage of preexisting impairment by the compensation
14 rate in effect on the date of the accident or injury against which the
15 reduction will be applied.
16 (B) In all other cases, the employer against whom benefits are
17 currently being sought shall be entitled to a credit for the percentage of
18 preexisting impairment.
19 (f) If the employee receives retirement benefits under the federal
20 social security act, any compensation benefit payments for permanent
21 partial disability or permanent total disability that the employee is eligible
22 to receive under the workers compensation act for such claim shall be
23 reduced by 50% of the weekly equivalent amount of such retirement
24 benefits, but in no event shall the workers compensation benefit be less
25 than the workers compensation benefit payable for the employee's
26 percentage of functional impairment. The reduction in benefits allowed by
27 this subsection shall not apply to temporary total disability compensation
28 or temporary partial disability compensation.
29 (g) If the employee receives retirement benefits from any other
30 retirement system, program, policy or plan that is provided by the
31 employer against whom the claim is being made, any compensation for
32 permanent partial disability or permanent total disability benefits the
33 employee is eligible to receive under the workers compensation act for the
34 claim shall be reduced by the weekly equivalent amount of such retirement
35 benefits less any portion of any such retirement benefit that is attributable
36 to payments or contributions made by the employee. In no event shall the
37 workers compensation benefit be less than the workers compensation
38 benefit payable for the employee's percentage of functional impairment.
39 The credit allowed by this subsection shall not apply to temporary total
40 disability compensation or temporary partial disability compensation.
41 (h) Where the employee elects to take retirement benefits in a lump
42 sum, the lump sum payment shall be amortized at the rate of 4% per year
43 over the employee's life expectancy to determine the weekly equivalent
SB 294 82
1 value of the benefits.
2 Sec. 61. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 44-706 is hereby amended to read as
3 follows: 44-706. The secretary shall examine whether an individual has
4 separated from employment for each week claimed. The secretary shall
5 apply the provisions of this section to the individual's most recent
6 employment prior to the week claimed. An individual shall be disqualified
7 for benefits:
8 (a) If the individual left work voluntarily without good cause
9 attributable to the work or the employer, subject to the other provisions of
10 this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, "good cause" is cause of
11 such gravity that would impel a reasonable, not supersensitive, individual
12 exercising ordinary common sense to leave employment. Good cause
13 requires a showing of good faith of the individual leaving work, including
14 the presence of a genuine desire to work. Failure to return to work after
15 expiration of approved personal or medical leave, or both, shall be
16 considered a voluntary resignation. After a temporary job assignment,
17 failure of an individual to affirmatively request an additional assignment
18 on the next succeeding workday, if required by the employment
19 agreement, after completion of a given work assignment, shall constitute
20 leaving work voluntarily. The disqualification shall begin the day
21 following the separation and shall continue until after the individual has
22 become reemployed and has had earnings from insured work of at least
23 three times the individual's weekly benefit amount. An individual shall not
24 be disqualified under this subsection if:
25 (1) The individual was forced to leave work because of illness or
26 injury upon the advice of a licensed and practicing healthcare provider
27 and, upon learning of the necessity for absence, immediately notified the
28 employer thereof, or the employer consented to the absence, and after
29 recovery from the illness or injury, when recovery was certified by a
30 practicing health care provider, the individual returned to the employer and
31 offered to perform services and the individual's regular work or
32 comparable and suitable work was not available. As used in this paragraph
33 "healthcare provider" means any person licensed by the proper licensing
34 authority of any state to engage in the practice of medicine and surgery,
35 osteopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, optometry, podiatry or psychology;
36 (2) the individual left temporary work to return to the regular
37 employer;

31 If in any case separate branches of work that are commonly conducted as
32 separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate
33 departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the
34 purpose of this subsection be deemed to be a separate factory,
35 establishment or other premises. For the purposes of this subsection,
36 failure or refusal to cross a picket line or refusal for any reason during the
37 continuance of such labor dispute to accept the individual's available and
38 customary work at the factory, establishment or other premises where the
39 individual is or was last employed shall be considered as participation and

13 compensation law administered by the secretary of labor, unless the
14 individual has repaid the full amount of the overpayment as determined by
15 the secretary or the secretary's designee, including, but not limited to, the
16 total amount of money erroneously paid as benefits or unlawfully

24 knowingly made a false statement or representation or who has knowingly
25 failed to disclose a material fact to obtain or increase benefits under this
26 act or any other unemployment compensation law administered by the
27 secretary of labor shall be liable for a penalty in the amount equal to 25%
28 of the amount of benefits unlawfully received. Notwithstanding any other
29 provision of law, such penalty shall be deposited into the employment
30 security trust fund. No person who is a victim of identify theft shall be
31 subject to the provisions of this subsection. The secretary shall investigate
32 all cases of an alleged false statement or representation or failure to
33 disclose a material fact to ensure no victim of identity theft is disqualified,

1 academic years or terms or, when an agreement provides instead for a

10 capacity other than service in an instructional, research, or administrative

19 amount payable to the individual shall be reduced, but not below zero, by
20 an amount equal to the amount of such pension, retirement or retired pay,
21 annuity or other similar periodic payment that is attributable to such week;
22 or
23 (2) if only a portion of contributions to such plan were provided by

28 of an alleged violation, or any part of it, shall be counted as time served on
29 supervision. Any violation of the conditions of such supervision may
30 subject such person to revocation of supervision and imprisonment in jail
31 for the remainder of the period of imprisonment, the remainder of the
32 supervision period, or any combination or portion thereof. The term of
33 supervision may be extended at the court's discretion beyond one year, and

36 jail of up to the remainder of the original sentence, not the term of the
37 extended supervision.

11 penalty, the judge may order the person on house arrest, work release or
12 other conditional release.
13 (d) (1) If a person is charged with a violation of subsection (a)(4) or
14 (a)(5), the fact that the person is or has been entitled to use the drug under
15 the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against the charge.
16 (2) The fact that a person tests positive for the presence of cannabis
17 metabolites shall not constitute a violation of subsection (a)(4) or (a)(5).
18 (e) The court may establish the terms and time for payment of any
19 fines, fees, assessments and costs imposed pursuant to this section. Any
20 assessment and costs shall be required to be paid not later than 90 days

27 community service. The community service ordered by the court shall be
28 required to be performed not later than one year after the fine is imposed
29 or by an earlier date specified by the court. If by the required date the
30 person performs an insufficient amount of community service to reduce to
31 zero the portion of the fine required to be paid by the person, the
32 remaining balance of the fine shall become due on that date.
33 (2) The court may, in its discretion, waive any portion of a fine
34 imposed pursuant to this section, except the $250 required to be remitted
35 to the state treasurer pursuant to subsection (q)(2), upon a showing that the

24 the method of payment. The amount of attorney fees to be included in the
25 court order for reimbursement shall be the amount claimed by appointed

19 the purposes for which the defendant committed the crime was for the
20 purpose of the defendant's sexual gratification.
21 (e) If an inmate is sentenced to imprisonment for a crime committed
22 while on parole or conditional release, the inmate shall be eligible for
23 parole as provided by subsection (c), except that the prisoner review board
24 may postpone the inmate's parole eligibility date by assessing a penalty not
25 exceeding the period of time which could have been assessed if the
26 inmate's parole or conditional release had been violated for reasons other
27 than conviction of a crime.
28 (f) If a person is sentenced to prison for a crime committed on or after
29 July 1, 1993, while on probation, parole, conditional release or in a
30 community corrections program, for a crime committed prior to July 1,
31 1993, and the person is not eligible for retroactive application of the
32 sentencing guidelines and amendments thereto pursuant to K.S.A. 21-
33 4724, prior to its repeal, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the
34 old sentence, but shall begin when the person is paroled or reaches the
35 conditional release date on the old sentence. If the offender was past the
36 offender's conditional release date at the time the new offense was
37 committed, the new sentence shall not be aggregated with the old sentence
38 but shall begin when the person is ordered released by the prisoner review
39 board or reaches the maximum sentence expiration date on the old
40 sentence, whichever is earlier. The new sentence shall then be served as
41 otherwise provided by law. The period of postrelease supervision shall be
42 based on the new sentence, except that those offenders whose old sentence
43 is a term of imprisonment for life, imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 1993 Supp.

SB 294 62

4 supervision for life or until discharged from supervision by the prisoner

6 (g) Subject to the provisions of this section, the prisoner review board
7 may release on parole those persons confined in institutions who are
8 eligible for parole when: (1) The board believes that the inmate should be
9 released for hospitalization, deportation or to answer the warrant or other
10 process of a court and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability
11 that the inmate can be released without detriment to the community or to
12 the inmate; or (2) the secretary of corrections has reported to the board in
13 writing that the inmate has satisfactorily completed the programs required
14 by any agreement entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments
15 thereto, or any revision of such agreement, and the board believes that the
16 inmate is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law abiding citizen
17 and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability that the inmate
18 can be released without detriment to the community or to the inmate.
19 Parole shall not be granted as an award of clemency and shall not be
20 considered a reduction of sentence or a pardon.
21 (h) The prisoner review board shall hold a parole hearing at least the
22 month prior to the month an inmate will be eligible for parole under
23 subsections (a), (b) and (c). At least one month preceding the parole
24 hearing, the county or district attorney of the county where the inmate was
25 convicted shall give written notice of the time and place of the public
26 comment sessions for the inmate to any victim of the inmate's crime who
27 is alive and whose address is known to the county or district attorney or, if
28 the victim is deceased, to the victim's family if the family's address is
29 known to the county or district attorney. Except as otherwise provided,
30 failure to notify pursuant to this section shall not be a reason to postpone a
31 parole hearing. In the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
32 a class A felony, the secretary of corrections shall give written notice of the
33 time and place of the public comment session for such inmate at least one
34 month preceding the public comment session to any victim of such
35 inmate's crime or the victim's family pursuant to K.S.A. 74-7338, and
36 amendments thereto. If notification is not given to such victim or such
37 victim's family in the case of any inmate convicted of an off-grid felony or
38 a class A felony, the board shall postpone a decision on parole of the
39 inmate to a time at least 30 days after notification is given as provided in
40 this section. Nothing in this section shall create a cause of action against
41 the state or an employee of the state acting within the scope of the
42 employee's employment as a result of the failure to notify pursuant to this
43 section. If granted parole, the inmate may be released on parole on the date

SB 294 63
1 specified by the board, but not earlier than the date the inmate is eligible
2 for parole under subsections (a), (b) and (c). At each parole hearing and, if
3 parole is not granted, at such intervals thereafter as it determines
4 appropriate, the board shall consider: (1) Whether the inmate has
5 satisfactorily completed the programs required by any agreement entered
6 under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, or any revision of such
7 agreement; and (2) all pertinent information regarding such inmate,
8 including, but not limited to, the circumstances of the offense of the
9 inmate; the presentence report; the previous social history and criminal
10 record of the inmate; the conduct, employment, and attitude of the inmate
11 in prison; the reports of such physical and mental examinations as have
12 been made, including, but not limited to, risk factors revealed by any risk
13 assessment of the inmate; comments of the victim and the victim's family
14 including in person comments, contemporaneous comments and
15 prerecorded comments made by any technological means; comments of
16 the public; official comments; any recommendation by the staff of the
17 facility where the inmate is incarcerated; proportionality of the time the
18 inmate has served to the sentence a person would receive under the Kansas
19 sentencing guidelines for the conduct that resulted in the inmate's
20 incarceration; and capacity of state correctional institutions.
21 (i) In those cases involving inmates sentenced for a crime committed
22 after July 1, 1993, the prisoner review board will review the inmate's
23 proposed release plan. The board may schedule a hearing if they desire.
24 The board may impose any condition they deem necessary to insure public
25 safety, aid in the reintegration of the inmate into the community, or items
26 not completed under the agreement entered into under K.S.A. 75-5210a,
27 and amendments thereto. The board may not advance or delay an inmate's
28 release date. Every inmate while on postrelease supervision shall remain in
29 the legal custody of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders
30 of the secretary.
31 (j) (1) Before ordering the parole of any inmate, the prisoner review
32 board shall have the inmate appear either in person or via a video
33 conferencing format and shall interview the inmate unless impractical
34 because of the inmate's physical or mental condition or absence from the
35 institution. Every inmate while on parole shall remain in the legal custody
36 of the secretary of corrections and is subject to the orders of the secretary.
37 Whenever the board formally considers placing an inmate on parole and
38 no agreement has been entered into with the inmate under K.S.A. 75-
39 5210a, and amendments thereto, the board shall notify the inmate in
40 writing of the reasons for not granting parole. If an agreement has been
41 entered under K.S.A. 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the inmate
42 has not satisfactorily completed the programs specified in the agreement,
43 or any revision of such agreement, the board shall notify the inmate in

SB 294 64
1 writing of the specific programs the inmate must satisfactorily complete
2 before parole will be granted. If parole is not granted only because of a
3 failure to satisfactorily complete such programs, the board shall grant
4 parole upon the secretary's certification that the inmate has successfully
5 completed such programs. If an agreement has been entered under K.S.A.
6 75-5210a, and amendments thereto, and the secretary of corrections has
7 reported to the board in writing that the inmate has satisfactorily
8 completed the programs required by such agreement, or any revision
9 thereof, the board shall not require further program participation.
10 However, if the board determines that other pertinent information
11 regarding the inmate warrants the inmate's not being released on parole,
12 the board shall state in writing the reasons for not granting the parole. If
13 parole is denied for an inmate sentenced for a crime other than a class A or
14 class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board shall hold another parole
15 hearing for the inmate not later than one year after the denial unless the
16 board finds that it is not reasonable to expect that parole would be granted
17 at a hearing if held in the next three years or during the interim period of a
18 deferral. In such case, the board may defer subsequent parole hearings for
19 up to three years but any such deferral by the board shall require the board
20 to state the basis for its findings. If parole is denied for an inmate
21 sentenced for a class A or class B felony or an off-grid felony, the board
22 shall hold another parole hearing for the inmate not later than three years
23 after the denial unless the board finds that it is not reasonable to expect
24 that parole would be granted at a hearing if held in the next 10 years or
25 during the interim period of a deferral. In such case, the board may defer
26 subsequent parole hearings for up to 10 years, but any such deferral shall
27 require the board to state the basis for its findings.
28 (2) Inmates sentenced for a class A or class B felony who have not
29 had a board hearing in the five years prior to July 1, 2010, shall have such
30 inmates' cases reviewed by the board on or before July 1, 2012. Such
31 review shall begin with the inmates with the oldest deferral date and
32 progress to the most recent. Such review shall be done utilizing existing
33 resources unless the board determines that such resources are insufficient.
34 If the board determines that such resources are insufficient, then the
35 provisions of this paragraph are subject to appropriations therefor.
36 (k) (1) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision shall be
37 assigned, upon release, to the appropriate level of supervision pursuant to
38 the criteria established by the secretary of corrections.
39 (2) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
40 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
41 effects, vehicle, residence and property by a parole officer or a department
42 of corrections enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any
43 time of the day or night, with or without a search warrant and with or

SB 294 65
1 without cause. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize
2 such officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the
3 sole purpose of harassment.
4 (3) Parolees and persons on postrelease supervision are, and shall
5 agree in writing to be, subject to searches of the person and the person's
6 effects, vehicle, residence and property by any law enforcement officer
7 based on reasonable suspicion of the person violating conditions of parole
8 or postrelease supervision or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Any
9 law enforcement officer who conducts such a search shall submit a written
10 report to the appropriate parole officer no later than the close of the next
11 business day after such search. The written report shall include the facts
12 leading to such search, the scope of such search and any findings resulting
13 from such search.
14 (l) The prisoner review board shall promulgate rules and regulations
15 in accordance with K.S.A. 77-415 et seq., and amendments thereto, not
16 inconsistent with the law and as it may deem proper or necessary, with
17 respect to the conduct of parole hearings, postrelease supervision reviews,
18 revocation hearings, orders of restitution, reimbursement of expenditures
19 by the state board of indigents' defense services and other conditions to be
20 imposed upon parolees or releasees. Whenever an order for parole or
21 postrelease supervision is issued it shall recite the conditions thereof.
22 (m) Whenever the prisoner review board orders the parole of an
23 inmate or establishes conditions for an inmate placed on postrelease
24 supervision, the board shall require that the inmate:
25 (1) Obey all laws and ordinances and report any law enforcement
26 contact to the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after such
27 contact;
28 (2) not engage in physical violence or threats of violence of any kind
29 and, if the inmate is being supervised for conviction of a felony, not
30 purchase or possess a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, while on
31 supervision;
32 (3) report to the inmate's supervision officer as directed and be
33 truthful in all matters;
34 (4) remain within the state of Kansas or other specified areas as
35 defined by the defendant's supervision officer;
36 (5) reside at the inmate's approved residence unless the defendant
37 receives permission from the inmate's supervision officer to relocate and
38 notify the inmate's supervision officer within 24 hours after any emergency
39 changes in residence or contact information;
40 (6) not possess, use or distribute any controlled substances except
41 those prescribed by a licensed medical professional;
42 (7) not possess or consume any form of alcohol or intoxicating
43 substance or enter any establishment where alcohol is sold or consumed as

SB 294 66
1 the primary business;
2 (8) submit to any form of alcohol or substance use testing directed by
3 the inmate's supervision officer and not alter or tamper with the specimen
4 or test;
5 (9) participate in assessment, treatment, programming and other
6 directives of the court or the inmate's supervision officer;
7 (10) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
8 residence and property by a parole officer or a department of corrections
9 enforcement, apprehension and investigation officer, at any time of the day
10 or night, with or without a search warrant and with or without cause,
11 except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize such
12 officers to conduct arbitrary or capricious searches or searches for the sole
13 purpose of harassment;
14 (11) submit to searches of the person and the person's effects, vehicle,
15 residence and property by any law enforcement officer based on

30 use of medical cannabis or medical cannabis products, as defined in
31 section 2, and amendments thereto, in accordance with the Kansas
32 medical cannabis act, section 1 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall not
33 be considered to render the parent unable to care for the ongoing physical,
34 mental or emotional needs of the child;
35 (4) physical, mental or emotional abuse or neglect or sexual abuse of
36 a child;
37 (5) conviction of a felony and imprisonment;
38 (6) unexplained injury or death of another child or stepchild of the
39 parent or any child in the care of the parent at the time of injury or death;
40 (7) failure of reasonable efforts made by appropriate public or private
41 agencies to rehabilitate the family;
42 (8) lack of effort on the part of the parent to adjust the parent's
43 circumstances, conduct or conditions to meet the needs of the child; and

SB 294 76
1 (9) whether, as a result of the actions or inactions attributable to the
2 parent and one or more of the factors listed in subsection (c) apply, the
3 child has been in the custody of the secretary and placed with neither
4 parent for 15 of the most recent 22 months beginning 60 days after the
5 date on which a child in the secretary's custody was removed from the
6 child's home.
7 (c) In addition to the foregoing, when a child is not in the physical
8 custody of a parent, the court, shall consider, but is not limited to, the
9 following:
10 (1) Failure to assure care of the child in the parental home when able
11 to do so;
12 (2) failure to maintain regular visitation, contact or communication
13 with the child or with the custodian of the child;
14 (3) failure to carry out a reasonable plan approved by the court
15 directed toward the integration of the child into a parental home; and
16 (4) failure to pay a reasonable portion of the cost of substitute
17 physical care and maintenance based on ability to pay.
18 In making the above determination, the court may disregard incidental
19 visitations, contacts, communications or contributions.
20 (d) A finding of unfitness may be made as provided in this section if
21 the court finds that the parents have abandoned the child, the custody of
22 the child was surrendered pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2282, and amendments
23 thereto, or the child was left under such circumstances that the identity of
24 the parents is unknown and cannot be ascertained, despite diligent
25 searching, and the parents have not come forward to claim the child within
26 three months after the child is found.
27 (e) If a person is convicted of a felony in which sexual intercourse
28 occurred, or if a juvenile is adjudicated a juvenile offender because of an
29 act which, if committed by an adult, would be a felony in which sexual
30 intercourse occurred, and as a result of the sexual intercourse, a child is
31 conceived, a finding of unfitness may be made.
32 (f) The existence of any one of the above factors standing alone may,
33 but does not necessarily, establish grounds for termination of parental
34 rights.
35 (g) (1) If the court makes a finding of unfitness, the court shall
36 consider whether termination of parental rights as requested in the petition
37 or motion is in the best interests of the child. In making the determination,
38 the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental and
39 emotional health of the child. If the physical, mental or emotional needs of
40 the child would best be served by termination of parental rights, the court
41 shall so order. A termination of parental rights under the code shall not
42 terminate the right of a child to inherit from or through a parent. Upon
43 such termination all rights of the parent to such child, including, such

SB 294 77
1 parent's right to inherit from or through such child, shall cease.
2 (2) If the court terminates parental rights, the court may authorize
3 adoption pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2270, and amendments thereto,
4 appointment of a permanent custodian pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2272, and
5 amendments thereto, or continued permanency planning.
6 (3) If the court does not terminate parental rights, the court may
7 authorize appointment of a permanent custodian pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
8 2272, and amendments thereto, or continued permanency planning.
9 (h) If a parent is convicted of an offense as provided in K.S.A. 38-
10 2271(a)(7), and amendments thereto, or is adjudicated a juvenile offender
11 because of an act which if committed by an adult would be an offense as
12 provided in K.S.A. 38-2271(a)(7), and amendments thereto, and if the
13 victim was the other parent of a child, the court may disregard such
14 convicted or adjudicated parent's opinions or wishes in regard to the
15 placement of such child.
16 (i) A record shall be made of the proceedings.
17 (j) When adoption, proceedings to appoint a permanent custodian or
18 continued permanency planning has been authorized, the person or agency
19 awarded custody of the child shall within 30 days submit a written plan for
20 permanent placement which shall include measurable objectives and time
21 schedules.
22 Sec. 60. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 44-501 is hereby amended to read as
23 follows: 44-501. (a) (1) Compensation for an injury shall be disallowed if
24 such injury to the employee results from:
25 (A) The employee's deliberate intention to cause such injury;
26 (B) the employee's willful failure to use a guard or protection against
27 accident or injury which is required pursuant to any statute and provided
28 for the employee;
29 (C) the employee's willful failure to use a reasonable and proper
30 guard and protection voluntarily furnished the employee by the employer;
31 (D) the employee's reckless violation of their employer's workplace
32 safety rules or regulations; or
33 (E) the employee's voluntary participation in fighting or horseplay
34 with a co-employee for any reason, work related or otherwise.
35 (2) Subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection
36 (a)Subsections (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(C) shall not apply when it was
37 reasonable under the totality of the circumstances to not use such
38 equipment, or if the employer approved the work engaged in at the time of
39 an accident or injury to be performed without such equipment.
40 (b) (1) (A) The employer shall not be liable under the workers
41 compensation act where the injury, disability or death was contributed to
42 by the employee's use or consumption of alcohol or any drugs, chemicals
43 or any other compounds or substances, including, but not limited to, any

SB 294 78
1 drugs or medications which that are available to the public without a
2 prescription from a healthcare provider, prescription drugs or medications,
3 any form or type of narcotic drugs, marijuana, stimulants, depressants or
4 hallucinogens.
5 (B) (i) In the case of drugs or medications which are available to the
6 public without a prescription from a healthcare provider and prescription
7 drugs or medications, compensation shall not be denied if the employee
8 can show that such drugs or medications were being taken or used in
9 therapeutic doses and there have been no prior incidences of the
10 employee's impairment on the job as the result of the use of such drugs or
11 medications within the previous 24 months.
12 (ii) In the case of cannabis, including any cannabis derivatives,
13 compensation shall not be denied if the employee has been issued a valid
14 identification card pursuant to the Kansas medical cannabis act, section 1
15 et seq., and amendments thereto, such cannabis or cannabis derivative
16 was used in accordance with such act, and there has been no prior
17 incidence of the employee's impairment on the job as a result of the use of
18 such cannabis or cannabis derivative within the immediately preceding 24
19 months.
20 (C) It shall be conclusively presumed that the employee was impaired
21 due to alcohol or drugs if it is shown that, at the time of the injury, the
22 employee had an alcohol concentration of .04 or more, or a GCMS
23 confirmatory test by quantitative analysis showing a concentration at or
24 above the levels shown on the following chart for the drugs of abuse listed:
25 Confirmatory

41 than or equal to 200 ng/ml.
42 4 Test for 6-AM when morphine concentration exceeds 2,000 ng/ml.
43 (D) If it is shown that the employee was impaired pursuant to

SB 294 79
1 subsection (b)(1)(C) at the time of the injury, there shall be a rebuttable
2 presumption that the accident, injury, disability or death was contributed to
3 by such impairment. The employee may overcome the presumption of
4 contribution by clear and convincing evidence.
5 (E) An employee's refusal to submit to a chemical test at the request
6 of the employer shall result in the forfeiture of benefits under the workers
7 compensation act if the employer had sufficient cause to suspect the use of
8 alcohol or drugs by the claimant or if the employer's policy clearly
9 authorizes post-injury testing.
10 (2) The results of a chemical test shall be admissible evidence to
11 prove impairment if the employer establishes that the testing was done
12 under any of the following circumstances:
13 (A) As a result of an employer mandated drug testing policy, in place
14 in writing prior to the date of accident or injury, requiring any worker to
15 submit to testing for drugs or alcohol;
16 (B) during an autopsy or in the normal course of medical treatment
17 for reasons related to the health and welfare of the injured worker and not
18 at the direction of the employer;
19 (C) the worker, prior to the date and time of the accident or injury,
20 gave written consent to the employer that the worker would voluntarily
21 submit to a chemical test for drugs or alcohol following any accident or
22 injury;
23 (D) the worker voluntarily agrees to submit to a chemical test for
24 drugs or alcohol following any accident or injury; or
25 (E) as a result of federal or state law or a federal or state rule or
26 regulation having the force and effect of law requiring a post-injury testing
27 program and such required program was properly implemented at the time
28 of testing.
29 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), the results of a chemical test
30 performed on a sample collected by an employer shall not be admissible
31 evidence to prove impairment unless the following conditions are met:
32 (A) The test sample was collected within a reasonable time following
33 the accident or injury;
34 (B) the collecting and labeling of the test sample was performed by or
35 under the supervision of a licensed healthcare professional;
36 (C) the test was performed by a laboratory approved by the United
37 States department of health and human services or licensed by the
38 department of health and environment, except that a blood sample may be
39 tested for alcohol content by a laboratory commonly used for that purpose
40 by state law enforcement agencies;
41 (D) the test was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass
42 spectroscopy or other comparably reliable analytical method, except that
43 no such confirmation is required for a blood alcohol sample;

SB 294 80
1 (E) the foundation evidence must establish, beyond a reasonable
2 doubt, that the test results were from the sample taken from the employee;
3 and
4 (F) a split sample sufficient for testing shall be retained and made
5 available to the employee within 48 hours of a positive test.
6 (c) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), compensation shall not
7 be paid in case of coronary or coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular
8 injury unless it is shown that the exertion of the work necessary to
9 precipitate the disability was more than the employee's usual work in the
10 course of the employee's regular employment.
11 (2) For events occurring on or after July 1, 2014, in the case of a
12 firefighter as defined by K.S.A. 40-1709(b)(1), and amendments thereto,
13 or a law enforcement officer as defined by K.S.A. 74-5602, and
14 amendments thereto, coronary or coronary artery disease or
15 cerebrovascular injury shall be compensable if:
16 (A) The injury can be identified as caused by a specific event
17 occurring in the course and scope of employment;
18 (B) the coronary or cerebrovascular injury occurred within 24 hours
19 of the specific event; and
20 (C) the specific event was the prevailing factor in causing the
21 coronary or coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular injury.
22 (d) Except as provided in the workers compensation act, no
23 construction design professional who is retained to perform professional
24 services on a construction project or any employee of a construction
25 design professional who is assisting or representing the construction
26 design professional in the performance of professional services on the site
27 of the construction project, shall be liable for any injury resulting from the
28 employer's failure to comply with safety standards on the construction
29 project for which compensation is recoverable under the workers
30 compensation act, unless responsibility for safety practices is specifically
31 assumed by contract. The immunity provided by this subsection to any
32 construction design professional shall not apply to the negligent
33 preparation of design plans or specifications.
34 (e) An award of compensation for permanent partial impairment,
35 work disability, or permanent total disability shall be reduced by the
36 amount of functional impairment determined to be preexisting to the same
37 physical structure as the body part injured. Any such reduction shall not
38 apply to temporary total disability, nor shall it apply to compensation for
39 medical treatment.
40 (1) Where workers compensation benefits have previously been
41 awarded through settlement or judicial or administrative determination in
42 Kansas, the percentage basis of the prior settlement or award shall
43 conclusively establish the amount of functional impairment determined to

SB 294 81
1 be preexisting. Where workers compensation benefits have not previously
2 been awarded through settlement or judicial or administrative
3 determination in Kansas, the amount of preexisting functional impairment
4 shall be established by competent evidence.
5 (2) In all cases, the applicable reduction shall be calculated as
6 follows:
7 (A) If the preexisting impairment is the result of injury sustained
8 while working for the employer against whom workers compensation
9 benefits are currently being sought, any award of compensation shall be
10 reduced by the current dollar value attributable under the workers
11 compensation act to the percentage of functional impairment determined to
12 be preexisting. The "current dollar value" shall be calculated by
13 multiplying the percentage of preexisting impairment by the compensation
14 rate in effect on the date of the accident or injury against which the
15 reduction will be applied.
16 (B) In all other cases, the employer against whom benefits are
17 currently being sought shall be entitled to a credit for the percentage of
18 preexisting impairment.
19 (f) If the employee receives retirement benefits under the federal
20 social security act, any compensation benefit payments for permanent
21 partial disability or permanent total disability that the employee is eligible
22 to receive under the workers compensation act for such claim shall be
23 reduced by 50% of the weekly equivalent amount of such retirement
24 benefits, but in no event shall the workers compensation benefit be less
25 than the workers compensation benefit payable for the employee's
26 percentage of functional impairment. The reduction in benefits allowed by
27 this subsection shall not apply to temporary total disability compensation
28 or temporary partial disability compensation.
29 (g) If the employee receives retirement benefits from any other
30 retirement system, program, policy or plan that is provided by the
31 employer against whom the claim is being made, any compensation for
32 permanent partial disability or permanent total disability benefits the
33 employee is eligible to receive under the workers compensation act for the
34 claim shall be reduced by the weekly equivalent amount of such retirement
35 benefits less any portion of any such retirement benefit that is attributable
36 to payments or contributions made by the employee. In no event shall the
37 workers compensation benefit be less than the workers compensation
38 benefit payable for the employee's percentage of functional impairment.
39 The credit allowed by this subsection shall not apply to temporary total
40 disability compensation or temporary partial disability compensation.
41 (h) Where the employee elects to take retirement benefits in a lump
42 sum, the lump sum payment shall be amortized at the rate of 4% per year
43 over the employee's life expectancy to determine the weekly equivalent

SB 294 82
1 value of the benefits.
2 Sec. 61. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 44-706 is hereby amended to read as
3 follows: 44-706. The secretary shall examine whether an individual has
4 separated from employment for each week claimed. The secretary shall
5 apply the provisions of this section to the individual's most recent
6 employment prior to the week claimed. An individual shall be disqualified
7 for benefits:
8 (a) If the individual left work voluntarily without good cause
9 attributable to the work or the employer, subject to the other provisions of
10 this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, "good cause" is cause of
11 such gravity that would impel a reasonable, not supersensitive, individual
12 exercising ordinary common sense to leave employment. Good cause
13 requires a showing of good faith of the individual leaving work, including
14 the presence of a genuine desire to work. Failure to return to work after
15 expiration of approved personal or medical leave, or both, shall be
16 considered a voluntary resignation. After a temporary job assignment,
17 failure of an individual to affirmatively request an additional assignment
18 on the next succeeding workday, if required by the employment
19 agreement, after completion of a given work assignment, shall constitute
20 leaving work voluntarily. The disqualification shall begin the day
21 following the separation and shall continue until after the individual has
22 become reemployed and has had earnings from insured work of at least
23 three times the individual's weekly benefit amount. An individual shall not
24 be disqualified under this subsection if:
25 (1) The individual was forced to leave work because of illness or
26 injury upon the advice of a licensed and practicing healthcare provider
27 and, upon learning of the necessity for absence, immediately notified the
28 employer thereof, or the employer consented to the absence, and after
29 recovery from the illness or injury, when recovery was certified by a
30 practicing health care provider, the individual returned to the employer and
31 offered to perform services and the individual's regular work or
32 comparable and suitable work was not available. As used in this paragraph
33 "healthcare provider" means any person licensed by the proper licensing
34 authority of any state to engage in the practice of medicine and surgery,
35 osteopathy, chiropractic, dentistry, optometry, podiatry or psychology;
36 (2) the individual left temporary work to return to the regular
37 employer;
38 (3) the individual left work to enter active service in the armed forces
39 of the United States but was rejected or delayed from entry;
40 (4) The spouse of an individual who is a member of the armed forces
41 of the United States who left work because of the voluntary or involuntary
42 transfer of the individual's spouse from one job to another job that is for
43 the same employer or for a different employer, at a geographic location

SB 294 83
1 that makes it unreasonable for the individual to continue work at the
2 individual's job. For the purposes of this provision "member of the armed
3 forces" means a person performing active service in the army, navy,
4 marine corps, air force, space force, coast guard or any component of the
5 military reserves of the United States;
6 (5) the individual left work because of hazardous working conditions;
7 in determining whether or not working conditions are hazardous for an
8 individual, the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety and
9 morals, the individual's physical fitness and prior training and the working
10 conditions of workers engaged in the same or similar work for the same
11 and other employers in the locality shall be considered; as used in this
12 paragraph, "hazardous working conditions" means working conditions that
13 could result in a danger to the physical or mental well-being of the
14 individual; each determination as to whether hazardous working
15 conditions exist shall include, but shall not be limited to, a consideration
16 of: (A) The safety measures used or the lack thereof; and (B) the condition
17 of equipment or lack of proper equipment; no work shall be considered
18 hazardous if the working conditions surrounding the individual's work are
19 the same or substantially the same as the working conditions generally
20 prevailing among individuals performing the same or similar work for
21 other employers engaged in the same or similar type of activity;
22 (6) the individual left work to enter training approved under section
23 236(a)(1) of the federal trade act of 1974, provided the work left is not of a
24 substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual's past adversely
25 affected employment, as defined for purposes of the federal trade act of
26 1974, and wages for such work are not less than 80% of the individual's
27 average weekly wage as determined for the purposes of the federal trade
28 act of 1974;
29 (7) the individual left work because of unwelcome harassment of the
30 individual by the employer or another employee of which the employing
31 unit had knowledge and that would impel the average worker to give up
32 such worker's employment;
33 (8) the individual left work to accept better work; each determination
34 as to whether or not the work accepted is better work shall include, but
35 shall not be limited to, consideration of: (A) The rate of pay, the hours of
36 work and the probable permanency of the work left as compared to the
37 work accepted; (B) the cost to the individual of getting to the work left in
38 comparison to the cost of getting to the work accepted; and (C) the
39 distance from the individual's place of residence to the work accepted in
40 comparison to the distance from the individual's residence to the work left;
41 (9) the individual left work as a result of being instructed or requested
42 by the employer, a supervisor or a fellow employee to perform a service or
43 commit an act in the scope of official job duties that is in violation of an

SB 294 84
1 ordinance or statute;
2 (10) the individual left work because of a substantial violation of the
3 work agreement by the employing unit and, before the individual left, the
4 individual had exhausted all remedies provided in such agreement for the
5 settlement of disputes before terminating. For the purposes of this
6 paragraph, a demotion based on performance does not constitute a
7 violation of the work agreement;
8 (11) after making reasonable efforts to preserve the work, the
9 individual left work due to a personal emergency of such nature and
10 compelling urgency that it would be contrary to good conscience to
11 impose a disqualification; or
12 (12) (A) the individual left work due to circumstances resulting from
13 domestic violence, including:
14 (i) The individual's reasonable fear of future domestic violence at or
15 en route to or from the individual's place of employment;
16 (ii) the individual's need to relocate to another geographic area in
17 order to avoid future domestic violence;
18 (iii) the individual's need to address the physical, psychological and
19 legal impacts of domestic violence;
20 (iv) the individual's need to leave employment as a condition of
21 receiving services or shelter from an agency that provides support services
22 or shelter to victims of domestic violence; or
23 (v) the individual's reasonable belief that termination of employment
24 is necessary to avoid other situations that may cause domestic violence and
25 to provide for the future safety of the individual or the individual's family.
26 (B) An individual may prove the existence of domestic violence by
27 providing one of the following:
28 (i) A restraining order or other documentation of equitable relief by a
29 court of competent jurisdiction;
30 (ii) a police record documenting the abuse;
31 (iii) documentation that the abuser has been convicted of one or more
32 of the offenses enumerated in articles 34 and 35 of chapter 21 of the
33 Kansas Statutes Annotated, prior to their repeal, or articles 54 or 55 of
34 chapter 21 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, or K.S.A. 21-6104, 21-6325,
35 21-6326 or 21-6418 through 21-6422, and amendments thereto, where the
36 victim was a family or household member;
37 (iv) medical documentation of the abuse;
38 (v) a statement provided by a counselor, social worker, health care
39 provider, clergy, shelter worker, legal advocate, domestic violence or
40 sexual assault advocate or other professional who has assisted the
41 individual in dealing with the effects of abuse on the individual or the
42 individual's family; or
43 (vi) a sworn statement from the individual attesting to the abuse.

SB 294 85
1 (C) No evidence of domestic violence experienced by an individual,
2 including the individual's statement and corroborating evidence, shall be
3 disclosed by the department of labor unless consent for disclosure is given
4 by the individual.
5 (b) If the individual has been discharged or suspended for misconduct
6 connected with the individual's work. The disqualification shall begin the
7 day following the separation and shall continue until after the individual
8 becomes reemployed and in cases where the disqualification is due to
9 discharge for misconduct has had earnings from insured work of at least
10 three times the individual's determined weekly benefit amount, except that
11 if an individual is discharged for gross misconduct connected with the
12 individual's work, such individual shall be disqualified for benefits until
13 such individual again becomes employed and has had earnings from
14 insured work of at least eight times such individual's determined weekly
15 benefit amount. In addition, all wage credits attributable to the
16 employment from which the individual was discharged for gross
17 misconduct connected with the individual's work shall be canceled. No
18 such cancellation of wage credits shall affect prior payments made as a
19 result of a prior separation.
20 (1) (A) As used in this subsection, "misconduct" means a violation of
21 a duty or obligation reasonably owed the employer as a condition of
22 employment including, but not limited to, a violation of a company rule,
23 including a safety rule, if: (A)(i) The individual knew or should have
24 known about the rule; (B)(ii) the rule was lawful and reasonably related to
25 the job; and (C)(iii) the rule was fairly and consistently enforced.
26 (B) "Misconduct" does not include any violation of a duty, obligation
27 or company rule, if: (i) The individual is a patient who has been issued a
28 valid identification card pursuant to section 9, and amendments thereto;
29 and (ii) the basis for the violation is the possession of such identification
30 card or the possession or use of medical cannabis or a medical cannabis
31 product, as such terms are defined in section 2, and amendments thereto,
32 in accordance with the Kansas medical cannabis act, section 1 et seq., and
33 amendments thereto.
34 (2) (A) Failure of the employee to notify the employer of an absence
35 and an individual's leaving work prior to the end of such individual's
36 assigned work period without permission shall be considered prima facie
37 evidence of a violation of a duty or obligation reasonably owed the
38 employer as a condition of employment.
39 (B) For the purposes of this subsection, misconduct shall include, but
40 not be limited to, violation of the employer's reasonable attendance
41 expectations if the facts show:
42 (i) The individual was absent or tardy without good cause;
43 (ii) the individual had knowledge of the employer's attendance

SB 294 86
1 expectation; and
2 (iii) the employer gave notice to the individual that future absence or
3 tardiness may or will result in discharge.
4 (C) For the purposes of this subsection, if an employee disputes being
5 absent or tardy without good cause, the employee shall present evidence
6 that a majority of the employee's absences or tardiness were for good
7 cause. If the employee alleges that the employee's repeated absences or
8 tardiness were the result of health related issues, such evidence shall
9 include documentation from a licensed and practicing healthcare provider
10 as defined in subsection (a)(1).
11 (3) (A) (i) The term "gross misconduct" as used in this subsection
12 shall be construed to mean conduct evincing extreme, willful or wanton
13 misconduct as defined by this subsection. Gross misconduct shall include,

3 following conditions:
4 (1) If the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout or

31 If in any case separate branches of work that are commonly conducted as
32 separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate
33 departments of the same premises, each such department shall, for the
34 purpose of this subsection be deemed to be a separate factory,
35 establishment or other premises. For the purposes of this subsection,
36 failure or refusal to cross a picket line or refusal for any reason during the
37 continuance of such labor dispute to accept the individual's available and
38 customary work at the factory, establishment or other premises where the
39 individual is or was last employed shall be considered as participation and
40 interest in the labor dispute.

13 compensation law administered by the secretary of labor, unless the
14 individual has repaid the full amount of the overpayment as determined by
15 the secretary or the secretary's designee, including, but not limited to, the
16 total amount of money erroneously paid as benefits or unlawfully
17 obtained, interest, penalties and any other costs or fees provided by law. If

22 repaid the full amount of the overpayment. In addition to the penalties set
23 forth in K.S.A. 44-719, and amendments thereto, an individual who has
24 knowingly made a false statement or representation or who has knowingly
25 failed to disclose a material fact to obtain or increase benefits under this
26 act or any other unemployment compensation law administered by the
27 secretary of labor shall be liable for a penalty in the amount equal to 25%
28 of the amount of benefits unlawfully received. Notwithstanding any other
29 provision of law, such penalty shall be deposited into the employment
30 security trust fund. No person who is a victim of identify theft shall be
31 subject to the provisions of this subsection. The secretary shall investigate
32 all cases of an alleged false statement or representation or failure to
33 disclose a material fact to ensure no victim of identity theft is disqualified,
34 required to repay or subject to any penalty as provided by this subsection
35 as a result of identity theft.
