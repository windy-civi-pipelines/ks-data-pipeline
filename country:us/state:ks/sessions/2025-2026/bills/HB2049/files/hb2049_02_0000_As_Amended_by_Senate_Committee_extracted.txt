21 license that has been revoked, the commissioner shall consider the:
22 (A) Present moral fitness of the applicant;
23 (B) demonstrated consciousness by the applicant of the wrongful
24 conduct and disrepute that the conduct has brought to the insurance
25 profession;
26 (C) extent of the applicant's rehabilitation;

34 (e) Any action taken under this section that affects any license or
35 imposes any administrative penalty shall be taken only after notice and an
36 opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of
37 the Kansas administrative procedure act.
38 (d)(f) The commissioner shall remit all such fines collected under
39 subsection (c) to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of
40 K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such
41 remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state
42 treasury to the credit of the state general fund.
43 (g) Whenever the commissioner imposes any administrative penalty

HB 2049—Am. by SC 7
1 or denies, suspends, revokes or refuses renewal of any license pursuant to
2 subsection (a), any costs incurred as a result of conducting an
3 administrative hearing authorized under the provisions of this section
4 shall be assessed against the person who is the subject of the hearing or
5 any business entity represented by such person who is the party to the
6 matters giving rise to the hearing. As used in this subsection, "costs"
7 includes witness fees, mileage allowances, any costs associated with the
8 reproduction of documents that become a part of the hearing record and
9 the expense of making a record of the hearing.
10 (h) No person whose license as a public adjuster had been suspended
11 or revoked shall be employed by any insurance company doing business in
12 this state either directly, indirectly, as an independent contractor or
13 otherwise to negotiate or effect contracts of insurance, suretyship or
14 indemnity or perform any act toward the solicitation or transaction of any
15 business of insurance during the period of such suspension or revocation.
16 (e)(i) The commissioner shall retain the authority to enforce the
17 provisions of and impose any penalty or remedy authorized by this act
18 against any individual who is under investigation for or charged with a
19 violation of this act, even if the individual's license or registration has been
20 surrendered or has lapsed by operation of law.
21 (j) (1) An applicant to whom a license has been denied after a
22 hearing shall not apply again for a license until after the expiration of a
23 period of one year from the date of the commissioner's order.
24 (2) A licensee whose license was revoked shall not apply again for a
25 license until after the expiration of a period of two years from the date of
26 the commissioner's order.
27 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 40-5510 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-4909 are hereby
28 repealed.
