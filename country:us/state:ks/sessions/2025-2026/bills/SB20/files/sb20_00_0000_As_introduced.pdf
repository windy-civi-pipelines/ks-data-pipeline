31 maintain an assigned claims plan to provide that any person, who suffers
32 injury in this state may obtain personal injury protection benefits through
33 such plan if:
34 (1) Personal injury protection benefits are not available to the injured
35 person, except that personal injury protection benefits shall not be deemed
36 unavailable to any person suffering injury while such person was the
37 operator of a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, for which the owner
38 thereof has rejected personal injury protection benefits pursuant to
39 subsection (f) of K.S.A. 40-3107, and amendments thereto;
40 (2) Motor vehicle liability insurance or self-insurance applicable to
41 the injury cannot be identified;
42 (3) Personal injury protection benefits applicable to the injury are
43 inadequate to provide the contracted-for benefits because of financial

SB 20 6
1 inability of an insurer or self-insurer to fulfill its obligation; however,
2 except that benefits available through the assigned claims plan shall be
3 excess over any benefits paid or payable through the Kansas insurance
4 guaranty association. If the personal injury protection benefits are not paid
5 by the Kansas insurance guaranty association within the limitation of time
6 specified in this act, such benefits shall be paid by the assigned claims
7 plan. Payments made by the assigned claims plan pursuant to this section
8 shall constitute covered claims under K.S.A. 40-2901et seq., and
9 amendments thereto.
10 (b) If a claim qualifies for assignment under this section, the assigned
11 claims plan or any insurer or self-insurer to whom the claim is assigned
12 shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the claimant against any insurer
13 or self-insurer, its successor in interest or substitute, legally obligated to
14 provide personal injury protection benefits to the claimant, for any of such
15 benefits provided by the assignment.
16 (c) A person shall not be entitled to personal injury protection
17 benefits through the assigned claims plan with respect to injury which that
18 such person has sustained if, at the time of such injury, such person was
19 the owner of a motor vehicle for which a policy of motor vehicle liability
20 insurance is required under this act and such person failed to have such
21 policy in effect.
22 (d) The assigned claims plan shall be governed by such rules and
23 regulations as are necessary for its operation and for the assessment of
24 costs, which shall be approved by the commissioner. Any claim brought
25 through said plan shall be assigned to an insurer or self-insurer, in
26 accordance with the approved regulations of operation, and such insurer or
27 self-insurer, after the assignment, shall have the same rights and
28 obligations as it would have if, prior to such assignment, it had issued a
29 motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing personal injury
30 protection benefits applicable to the loss or expenses incurred or was a
31 self-insurer providing such benefits. Any party accepting benefits
32 hereunder under this section shall have such rights and obligations as such
33 person would have if a motor vehicle liability insurance policy providing
34 personal injury protection benefits were issued to such person.
35 (e) No insurer shall write any motor vehicle liability insurance policy
36 in this state unless the insurer participates in the assigned claims plan
37 organized pursuant to this section, nor shall any person qualify as a self-
38 insurer pursuant to subsection (f) of K.S.A. 40-3104, and amendments
39 thereto, unless such person agrees to participate in such assigned claims
40 plan. Any insurer or self-insurer required to participate in the assigned
41 claims plan who violates this subsection shall be assessed a civil penalty of
42 not more than $5,000 for each policy issued or self-insurance certificate
43 obtained in violation thereof.

24 determined by the board of regents.
25 (2) The state board of regents is hereby authorized to independently
26 provide, through self-insurance or the purchase of insurance contracts,
27 health care healthcare benefits for employees of a state educational
28 institution, as such term is defined in K.S.A. 76-711, and amendments
29 thereto, when the state health care healthcare benefits program is
30 insufficient to satisfy the requirements of 22 C.F.R. § 62.14, as in effect
31 upon the effective date of this section April 13, 2017. Such healthcare
32 benefits shall be limited to only those for whom the state health care
33 healthcare benefits program does not meet federal requirements.
34 (3) The state board of regents may purchase cybersecurity insurance
35 as it deems necessary to protect student records, labor information and
36 other statutorily protected data that the board maintains, independent of the
37 committee on surety bonds and insurance and without complying with the
38 provisions of K.S.A. 75-3738 through 75-3744, and amendments thereto.
39 As used in this paragraph, "cybersecurity insurance" includes, but is not
40 limited to, first-party coverage against losses such as data destruction,
41 denial of service attacks, theft, hacking and liability coverage guaranteeing
42 compensation for damages from errors such as the failure to safeguard
43 data.
