8 education agencies shall facilitate the opportunity for transitioning military
9 children's inclusion in extracurricular activities, regardless of application

13 families:
14 A. Waiver requirements - Local education agency administrative
15 officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar
16 course work has been satisfactorily completed in another local education
17 agency or shall provide reasonable justification for denial. Should a waiver
18 not be granted to a student who would qualify to graduate from the
19 sending school, the local education agency shall provide an alternative
20 means of acquiring required coursework so that graduation may occur on
21 time.
22 B. Exit exams - States shall accept: (1) Exit or end-of-course exams
23 required for graduation from the sending state; or (2) national norm-
24 referenced achievement tests or (3) alternative testing, in lieu of testing
25 requirements for graduation in the receiving state. In the event the above
26 alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a student
27 transferring in the senior year, then the provisions of paragraph C of this
28 article shall apply.

32 considered, the sending and receiving local education agencies shall
33 ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local education agency, if
34 the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local
35 education agency. In the event that one of the states in question is not a

37 facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with
38 paragraphs A and B of this article.
39 ARTICLE VIII. STATE COORDINATION

23 7. providing "start up" rules for initial administration of the compact.
24 B. The interstate commission, by a majority of the members, shall elect
25 annually from among its members a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a
26 treasurer, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be
27 specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or
28 disability, the vice-chairperson, shall preside at all meetings of the
29 interstate commission. The officers so elected shall serve without
30 compensation or remuneration from the interstate commission. Subject to
31 the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for
32 ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the
33 performance of their responsibilities as officers of the interstate
34 commission.
35 C. Executive Committee, Officers and Personnel
36 1. The executive committee shall have such authority and duties as may
37 be set forth in the bylaws, including but not limited to:
38 a. Managing the affairs of the interstate commission in a manner
39 consistent with the bylaws and purposes of the interstate commission;
40 b. overseeing an organizational structure within, and appropriate
41 procedures for the interstate commission to provide for the creation of
42 rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support
43 functions; and
HB 2102—Am. by HC 13
1 c. planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and
2 activities with other state, federal and local government organizations in
3 order to advance the goals of the interstate commission.
4 2. The executive committee may, subject to the approval of the
5 interstate commission, appoint or retain an executive director for such
6 period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation, as the
7 interstate commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall
8 serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member
9 of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and
10 supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate
11 commission.
12 D. The interstate commission's executive director and its employees
13 shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official
14 capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or
15 other civil liability caused by or arising out of or relating to an actual or
16 alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a
17 reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate
18 commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such
19 person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury,
20 or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of
21 such person.
22 1. The liability of the interstate commission's executive director and
23 employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the
24 scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions
25 occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability
26 set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials,
27 employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an
28 instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing
29 in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or
30 liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or
31 willful and wanton misconduct of such person.
32 2. The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its
33 employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other
34 appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate
35 commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission
36 representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
37 an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of
38 interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the
39 defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope
40 of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided
41 that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from
42 intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.
43 3. To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the
HB 2102—Am. by HC 14
1 interstate commission, the representatives or employees of the interstate
2 commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or
3 judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against such
4 persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that
5 occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or
6 responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing
7 occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or
8 responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
9 did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the
10 part of such persons.
11 ARTICLE XII. RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE
12 COMMISSION
13 A. Rulemaking Authority - The interstate commission shall promulgate
14 reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes
15 of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate
16 commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond
17 the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers granted hereunder, then
18 such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no
19 force or effect.
20 B. Rulemaking Procedure - Rules shall be made pursuant to a
21 rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "model state
22 administrative procedure act," of 1981 Act, uniform laws annotated, Vol.
23 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the
24 interstate commission.
25 C. Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may
26 file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of
27 such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming
28 effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial
29 likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the
30 interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the
31 rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the
32 interstate commission's authority.
33 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a
34 rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
35 adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
36 any compacting state.
37 ARTICLE XIII. OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE
38 RESOLUTION
39 A. Oversight
40 1. The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government
41 in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions
42 necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
43 The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall
HB 2102—Am. by HC 15
1 have standing as statutory law.
2 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in
3 any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to
4 the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers,
5 responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission.
6 3. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of
7 process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the
8 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
9 interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the
10 interstate commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
11 B. Default, Technical Assistance, Suspension and Termination - If the
12 interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
13 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the
14 bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:
15 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member
16 states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any
17 action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall
18 specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.
19 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding
20 the default.
21 3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
22 shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
23 majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits
24 conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of
25 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
26 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
27 4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be
28 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been
29 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
30 interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of
31 the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
32 5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for
33 all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
34 date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance
35 of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.
36 6. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any
37 state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or
38 terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in
39 writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
40 7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate
41 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
42 of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its
43 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
HB 2102—Am. by HC 16
1 litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
2 C. Dispute Resolution
3 1. The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a
4 member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and
5 which may arise among member states and between member and non-
6 member states.
7 2. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
8 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
9 D. Enforcement
10 1. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
11 discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
12 2. The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may
13 initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of
14 Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal
15 district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce
16 compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and
17 bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include
18 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
19 necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation
20 including reasonable attorney's fees.
21 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
22 interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any
23 other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.
24 ARTICLE XIV. FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
25 A. The interstate commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of
26 the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing
27 activities.
28 B. The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual
29 assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and
30 activities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total
31 amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as
32 approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be
33 allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate
34 commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member
35 states.
36 C. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind
37 prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same. The interstate
38 commission shall not pledge the credit of any of the member states, except
39 by and with the authority of the member state.
40 D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all
41 receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the
42 interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting
43 procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of
HB 2102—Am. by HC 17
1 funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a
2 certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be
3 included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate
4 commission.
5 ARTICLE XV. MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND
6 AMENDMENT
7 A. Any state is eligible to become a member state.
8 B. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative
9 enactment of the compact into law by no less than 10 of the states. The

11 become effective and binding as to any other member state upon
12 enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-
13 member states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the
14 activities of the interstate commission on a non-voting basis prior to
15 adoption of the compact by all states.
16 C. The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact
17 for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become
18 effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member
19 states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the
20 member states.
21 ARTICLE XVI. WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION
22 A. Withdrawal
23 1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain
24 binding upon each and every member state. A member state may withdraw
25 from the compact specifically repealing the statute, which enacted the
26 compact into law.
27 2. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute
28 repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the
29 effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has
30 been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member
31 jurisdiction.
32 3. The withdrawing state immediately shall notify the chairperson of
33 the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation
34 repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission
35 shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to
36 withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.
37 4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations
38 and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including
39 obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of
40 withdrawal.
41 5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur
42 upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date
43 as determined by the interstate commission.
HB 2102—Am. by HC 18
1 B. Dissolution of Compact
2 1. This compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal
3 or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the
4 compact to one member state.
5 2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and
6 void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs
7 of the interstate commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be
8 distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
9 ARTICLE XVII. SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION
10 A. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase,
11 clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining
12 provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
13 B. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to
14 effectuate its purposes.
15 C. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the
16 applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.
17 ARTICLE XVIII. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER
18 LAWS
19 A. Other Laws
20 1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
21 member state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
22 2. All member states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded
23 to the extent of the conflict.

33 in question in that member state.
34 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 72-8268 is hereby repealed.

As Amended by House Committee
Session of 2025
Substitute for HOUSE BILL No. 2102
By Committee on Education
2-11
1 AN ACT concerning school districts; relating to enrollment; providing for
2 the advance enrollment of a military student whose parent or person
3 acting as parent will be stationed in this state; correcting federal
4 statutory citations in the interstate compact on educational opportunity
5 for military children; amending K.S.A. 72-8268 and repealing the
6 existing section.
7
8 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
9 New Section 1. (a) A school district shall enroll any military student
10 in kindergarten or any of the grades one through 12 prior to such
11 student physically residing in this state if such student provides evidence
12 that such student's parent or person acting as parent will be stationed at a
13 military installation in this state during the current or immediately
14 succeeding school year. No proof of address shall be required at the time
15 of such enrollment. Residency within the district may be required for
16 attendance if the school district does not have open seats at the time of
17 enrollment as determined by K.S.A. 72-3123, and amendments thereto.
18 (b) If a school district offers a pre-kindergarten program, such
19 school district shall enroll any military student in such pre-
20 kindergarten program if such student is eligible to participate in such
21 program and such student provides evidence that such student's
22 parent or person acting as parent will be stationed at a military
23 installation in this state during the current or immediately succeeding
24 school year. If the school district has no open seats for such program,
25 then such student shall be placed on a waiting list for enrollment.
26 Proof of address shall not be required at the time of enrollment, but
27 such proof may be required for attendance. Nothing in this subsection
28 shall be construed to require a school district to offer a pre-
29 kindergarten program that such school district is not required to offer
30 or does not currently offer.
31 (c) If such student has an individualized education program (IEP) or a
32 504 plan, the school district shall take appropriate measures to ensure such
33 student will receive the required education and related services upon
34 attending school in the district.
35 (b)(d) As used in this section, "military student" means the same as
36 defined in K.S.A. 72-5139, and amendments thereto.

34 rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
35 adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
36 any compacting state.
37 ARTICLE XIII. OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE
38 RESOLUTION
39 A. Oversight
40 1. The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government
41 in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions
42 necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
43 The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall

HB 2102—Am. by HC 15
1 have standing as statutory law.
2 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in
3 any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to
4 the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers,
5 responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission.
6 3. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of
7 process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the
8 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
9 interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the
10 interstate commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
11 B. Default, Technical Assistance, Suspension and Termination - If the
12 interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
13 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the
14 bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:
15 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member
16 states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any
17 action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall
18 specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.
19 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding
20 the default.
21 3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
22 shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
23 majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits
24 conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of
25 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
26 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
27 4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be
28 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been
29 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
30 interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of
31 the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
32 5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for
33 all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
34 date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance
35 of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.
36 6. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any
37 state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or
38 terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in
39 writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
40 7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate
41 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
42 of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its
43 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such

HB 2102—Am. by HC 16
1 litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
2 C. Dispute Resolution
3 1. The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a
4 member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and
5 which may arise among member states and between member and non-
6 member states.
7 2. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
8 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
9 D. Enforcement
10 1. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
11 discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
12 2. The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may
13 initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of
14 Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal
15 district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce
16 compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and
17 bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include
18 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
19 necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation
20 including reasonable attorney's fees.
21 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
22 interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any
23 other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.
24 ARTICLE XIV. FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
25 A. The interstate commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of
26 the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing
27 activities.
28 B. The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual
29 assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and
30 activities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total
31 amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as
32 approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be
33 allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate
34 commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member
35 states.
36 C. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind
37 prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same. The interstate
38 commission shall not pledge the credit of any of the member states, except
39 by and with the authority of the member state.
40 D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all
41 receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the
42 interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting
43 procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of

HB 2102—Am. by HC 17
1 funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a
2 certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be
3 included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate
4 commission.
5 ARTICLE XV. MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND
6 AMENDMENT
7 A. Any state is eligible to become a member state.
8 B. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative
9 enactment of the compact into law by no less than 10 of the states. The
10 effective date shall be no earlier than December 1, 2007. Thereafter it shall
11 become effective and binding as to any other member state upon
12 enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-
13 member states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the
14 activities of the interstate commission on a non-voting basis prior to
15 adoption of the compact by all states.
16 C. The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact
17 for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become
18 effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member
19 states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the
20 member states.
21 ARTICLE XVI. WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION
22 A. Withdrawal
23 1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain
24 binding upon each and every member state. A member state may withdraw
25 from the compact specifically repealing the statute, which enacted the
26 compact into law.
27 2. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute
28 repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the
29 effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has
30 been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member
31 jurisdiction.
32 3. The withdrawing state immediately shall notify the chairperson of
33 the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation
34 repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission
35 shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to
36 withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.
37 4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations
38 and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including
39 obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of
40 withdrawal.
41 5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur
42 upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date
43 as determined by the interstate commission.

HB 2102—Am. by HC 18

2 1. This compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal
3 or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the
4 compact to one member state.
5 2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and
6 void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs
7 of the interstate commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be
8 distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
9 ARTICLE XVII. SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION

11 clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining
12 provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
13 B. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to
14 effectuate its purposes.
15 C. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the
16 applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.
17 ARTICLE XVIII. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER
18 LAWS
19 A. Other Laws
20 1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
21 member state that is not inconsistent with this compact.

33 in question in that member state.
