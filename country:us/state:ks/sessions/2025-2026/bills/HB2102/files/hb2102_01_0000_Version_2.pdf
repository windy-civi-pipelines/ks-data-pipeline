Sub HB 2102 7
1 officials shall waive specific courses required for graduation if similar

31 activities with other state, federal and local government organizations in
32 order to advance the goals of the interstate commission.
33 2. The executive committee may, subject to the approval of the
34 interstate commission, appoint or retain an executive director for such
35 period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation, as the
36 interstate commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall
37 serve as secretary to the interstate commission, but shall not be a member
38 of the interstate commission. The executive director shall hire and
39 supervise such other persons as may be authorized by the interstate
40 commission.
41 D. The interstate commission's executive director and its employees
42 shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official
43 capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or

Sub HB 2102 13
1 other civil liability caused by or arising out of or relating to an actual or
2 alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a
3 reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of interstate
4 commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such
5 person shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury,
6 or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of
7 such person.
8 1. The liability of the interstate commission's executive director and
9 employees or interstate commission representatives, acting within the
10 scope of such person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions
11 occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability
12 set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials,
13 employees, and agents. The interstate commission is considered to be an
14 instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing
15 in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or
16 liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or
17 willful and wanton misconduct of such person.
18 2. The interstate commission shall defend the executive director and its
19 employees and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other
20 appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an interstate
21 commission representative, shall defend such interstate commission
22 representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
23 an actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of
24 interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the
25 defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope
26 of interstate commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided
27 that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from
28 intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.
29 3. To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the
30 interstate commission, the representatives or employees of the interstate
31 commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or
32 judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against such
33 persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that
34 occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or
35 responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing
36 occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties, or
37 responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission
38 did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the
39 part of such persons.
40 ARTICLE XII. RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE
41 COMMISSION
42 A. Rulemaking Authority - The interstate commission shall promulgate
43 reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes

Sub HB 2102 14
1 of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the interstate
2 commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond
3 the scope of the purposes of this act, or the powers granted hereunder, then
4 such an action by the interstate commission shall be invalid and have no
5 force or effect.
6 B. Rulemaking Procedure - Rules shall be made pursuant to a
7 rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "model state
8 administrative procedure act," of 1981 Act, uniform laws annotated, Vol.
9 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the
10 interstate commission.
11 C. Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may
12 file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of
13 such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming
14 effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial
15 likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the
16 interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the
17 rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the
18 interstate commission's authority.
19 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a
20 rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
21 adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in
22 any compacting state.
23 ARTICLE XIII. OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE
24 RESOLUTION
25 A. Oversight
26 1. The executive, legislative and judicial branches of state government
27 in each member state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions
28 necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
29 The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall
30 have standing as statutory law.
31 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in
32 any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to
33 the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers,
34 responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission.
35 3. The interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of
36 process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the
37 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
38 interstate commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the
39 interstate commission, this compact or promulgated rules.
40 B. Default, Technical Assistance, Suspension and Termination - If the
41 interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the
42 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the
43 bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:

Sub HB 2102 15
1 1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member
2 states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default and any
3 action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall
4 specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.
5 2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding
6 the default.
7 3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state
8 shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a
9 majority of the member states and all rights, privileges and benefits
10 conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of
11 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
12 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
13 4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be
14 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been
15 exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
16 interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of
17 the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
18 5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for
19 all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective
20 date of suspension or termination including obligations, the performance
21 of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or termination.
22 6. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any
23 state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or
24 terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in
25 writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
26 7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate
27 commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District
28 of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its
29 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
30 litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
31 C. Dispute Resolution
32 1. The interstate commission shall attempt, upon the request of a
33 member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and
34 which may arise among member states and between member and non-
35 member states.
36 2. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
37 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
38 D. Enforcement
39 1. The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
40 discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
41 2. The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may
42 initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of
43 Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal

Sub HB 2102 16
1 district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce
2 compliance with the provisions of the compact, its promulgated rules and
3 bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include
4 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
5 necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation
6 including reasonable attorney's fees.
7 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
8 interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any
9 other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.
10 ARTICLE XIV. FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
11 A. The interstate commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of
12 the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing
13 activities.
14 B. The interstate commission may levy on and collect an annual
15 assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and
16 activities of the interstate commission and its staff which must be in a total
17 amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission's annual budget as
18 approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be
19 allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate
20 commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member
21 states.
22 C. The interstate commission shall not incur obligations of any kind
23 prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same. The interstate
24 commission shall not pledge the credit of any of the member states, except
25 by and with the authority of the member state.
26 D. The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all
27 receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the
28 interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting
29 procedures established under its bylaws. All receipts and disbursements of
30 funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a
31 certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be
32 included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate
33 commission.
34 ARTICLE XV. MEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND
35 AMENDMENT
36 A. Any state is eligible to become a member state.
37 B. The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative
38 enactment of the compact into law by no less than 10 of the states. The
39 effective date shall be no earlier than December 1, 2007. Thereafter it shall
40 become effective and binding as to any other member state upon
41 enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of non-
42 member states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the
43 activities of the interstate commission on a non-voting basis prior to

Sub HB 2102 17
1 adoption of the compact by all states.
2 C. The interstate commission may propose amendments to the compact
3 for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become
4 effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the member
5 states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the
6 member states.
7 ARTICLE XVI. WITHDRAWAL AND DISSOLUTION
8 A. Withdrawal
9 1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain
10 binding upon each and every member state. A member state may withdraw
11 from the compact specifically repealing the statute, which enacted the
12 compact into law.
13 2. Withdrawal from this compact shall be by the enactment of a statute
14 repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the
15 effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has
16 been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member
17 jurisdiction.
18 3. The withdrawing state immediately shall notify the chairperson of
19 the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation
20 repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The interstate commission
21 shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to
22 withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.
23 4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations
24 and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including
25 obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of
26 withdrawal.
27 5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur
28 upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date
29 as determined by the interstate commission.
30 B. Dissolution of Compact
31 1. This compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal
32 or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the
33 compact to one member state.
34 2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and
35 void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs
36 of the interstate commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be
37 distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
38 ARTICLE XVII. SEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION
39 A. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase,
40 clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining
41 provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
42 B. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to
43 effectuate its purposes.

Sub HB 2102 18
1 C. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prohibit the
2 applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.
3 ARTICLE XVIII. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER
4 LAWS
5 A. Other Laws
6 1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
7 member state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
8 2. All member states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded
9 to the extent of the conflict.
10 B. Binding Effect of the Compact
11 1. All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules
12 and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon
13 the member states.
14 2. All agreements between the interstate commission and the member
15 states are binding in accordance with their terms.
16 3. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional
17 limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall
18 be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision
19 in question in that member state.
20 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 72-8268 is hereby repealed.
21 Sec. 4. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
22 publication in the statute book.
