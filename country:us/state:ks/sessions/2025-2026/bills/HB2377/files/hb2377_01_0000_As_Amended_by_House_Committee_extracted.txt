31 shall be remitted to the county treasurer and expended only for the purpose
32 for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
33 (3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),
34 on and after the effective date of this act, all moneys received by the

4 (2) For the purposes of subsections (a) and (b), any ad valorem
5 property tax levied on property located in a city in Johnson county for the

14 imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(2), (3)(C), (3)(F), (3)(G), (3)(I), (6),

16 (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (33), (34), (35), (36), (37) and (38), and
17 amendments thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the
18 county and expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received

22 sales tax imposed pursuant to K.S.A. 12-187(b)(5), and amendments
23 thereto, shall be remitted to and shall be retained by the county and
24 expended only for the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax
25 was pledged.

29 the purpose for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged
30 unless the question of imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax authorized
31 by K.S.A. 12-187(b)(26), and amendments thereto, includes the
32 apportionment of revenue prescribed in subsection (a).
33 (e) All revenue apportioned to the several cities of the county shall be
34 paid to the respective treasurers thereof and deposited in the general fund
35 of the city. Whenever the territory of any city is located in two or more
36 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
37 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
38 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
39 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
40 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
41 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
42 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
43 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
HB 2377—Am. by HC 4
1 each county treasurer of the revenue collected in such county from the
2 state retailers' sales tax for the preceding calendar year.
3 (g) Prior to December 31 of each year, the clerk of every county
4 imposing a countywide retailers' sales tax shall provide such information
5 deemed necessary by the secretary of revenue to apportion and remit
6 revenue to the counties and cities pursuant to this section.
7 (h) The provisions of subsections (a) and (b) for the apportionment of
8 countywide retailers' sales tax shall not apply to any revenues received
9 pursuant to a county or countywide retailers' sales tax levied or collected
10 under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto. All such revenue
11 collected under K.S.A. 74-8929, and amendments thereto, shall be
12 deposited into the redevelopment bond fund established by K.S.A. 74-
13 8927, and amendments thereto, for the period of time set forth in K.S.A.
14 74-8927, and amendments thereto.
15 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 12-192 is hereby repealed.
