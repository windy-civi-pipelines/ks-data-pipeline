25 for which the revenue received from the tax was pledged.
26 (3) In lieu of the apportionment formula provided in subsection (a),

29 counties and any one or more of such counties do not levy a countywide
30 retailers' sales tax, or whenever such counties do not levy countywide
31 retailers' sales taxes at a uniform rate, the revenue received by such city
32 from the proceeds of the countywide retailers' sales tax, as an alternative to
33 depositing the same in the general fund, may be used for the purpose of
34 reducing the tax levies of such city upon the taxable tangible property
35 located within the county levying such countywide retailers' sales tax.
36 (f) Prior to March 1 of each year, the secretary of revenue shall advise
