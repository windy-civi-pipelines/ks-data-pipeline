18 Section 1. K.S.A. 38-2361 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
19 2361. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
20 2356, and amendments thereto, modification of sentence pursuant to
21 K.S.A. 38-2367, and amendments thereto, or violation of a condition of
22 sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto, the court
23 may impose one or more of the following sentencing alternatives for a
24 fixed period pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments
25 thereto.
26 (1) Place the juvenile on probation for a fixed period pursuant to
27 K.S.A. 38-2391, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
28 the court deems appropriate consistent with juvenile justice programs in
29 the community. Any juvenile placed on probation shall be supervised
30 according to the juvenile's risk and needs as determined by a risk and
31 needs assessment. Placement of juvenile offenders to community
32 corrections for probation supervision shall be limited to offenders
33 adjudicated for an offense that are determined to be moderate-risk, high-
34 risk or very high-risk on a risk and needs assessment using the cutoff
35 scores established by the secretary pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2360, and
HB 2329—Am. by HC 2
1 amendments thereto.
2 (2) Order the juvenile to participate in a community based program
3 available in such judicial district subject to the terms and conditions the
4 court deems appropriate. This alternative shall not be ordered with the
5 alternative in paragraph (11). Requirements pertaining to child support
6 may apply if custody is vested with other than a parent.
7 (3) Place the juvenile in the custody of a parent or other suitable
8 person, which is not a group home youth residential facility or other
9 facility licensed pursuant to article 5 of chapter 65 of the Kansas Statutes
10 Annotated, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
11 consistent with juvenile justice programs in the community. This
12 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (10) or
13 (11). Requirements pertaining to child support may apply if custody is
14 vested with other than a parent.
15 (4) Order the juvenile to attend counseling, educational, mediation or
16 other sessions, or to undergo a drug evaluation pursuant to subsection (b).
17 (5) Suspend or restrict the juvenile's driver's license or privilege to
18 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state pursuant
19 to subsection (c).
20 (6) Order the juvenile to perform charitable or community service
21 work.
22 (7) Order the juvenile to make appropriate reparation or restitution
23 pursuant to subsection (d).
24 (8) Order the juvenile to pay a fine not exceeding $1,000 pursuant to
25 subsection (e).
26 (9) Place the juvenile under a house arrest program administered by
27 the court pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto.
28 (10) Place the juvenile in the custody of the secretary of corrections
29 as provided in K.S.A. 38-2365, and amendments thereto, and order the
30 secretary to place the juvenile in a youth residential facility. This
31 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (3) or
32 (12). Except for mandatory drug and alcohol evaluation, when this
33 alternative is ordered with alternatives in paragraphs (2), (4) and (9), such
34 orders shall constitute a recommendation by the court. Requirements
35 pertaining to child support shall apply under this alternative. The
36 provisions of this paragraph shall expire on January 1, 2018.
37 (11) Upon a violation of a condition of sentence, other than a
38 technical violation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto,
39 commit the juvenile to detention for a period no longer than 30 days
40 subject to the provisions of subsection (g).
41 (12) If the judge finds and enters into the written record that the
42 juvenile poses a significant risk of harm to another or damage to property,
43 and the juvenile is otherwise eligible for commitment pursuant to K.S.A.
HB 2329—Am. by HC 3
1 38-2369, and amendments thereto, commit the juvenile directly to the
2 custody of the secretary of corrections for placement in a juvenile
3 correctional facility or a youth residential facility. Placement in a youth
4 residential facility shall only be permitted as authorized in K.S.A. 38-
5 2369(e), and amendments thereto. If the court elects, a period of
6 conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
7 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
8 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
9 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
10 facility, the secretary of corrections or designee shall notify the court of the
11 juvenile's anticipated release date. This alternative may be ordered with the
12 alternative in paragraph (7). Requirements pertaining to child support shall
13 apply under this alternative.
14 (13) Upon a finding by the trier of fact during adjudication that a
15 firearm was possessed or used in during the commission of an offense by
16 the accused which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, a
17 judge may commit the juvenile directly to the custody of the secretary of
18 corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility or youth
19 residential facility for a minimum term of six 12 months and up to a
20 maximum term of 18 24 months, regardless of the risk level of such
21 juvenile as determined by a risk and needs assessment. If the juvenile is
22 committed to the custody of the secretary, and the court elects, a period of
23 conditional release, pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
24 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
25 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
26 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
27 facility or youth residential facility, the secretary of corrections or the
28 secretary's designee shall notify the court of the juvenile's anticipated
29 release date.
30 (b) If the court orders the juvenile to attend counseling, educational,
31 mediation or other sessions, or to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation
32 pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the following provisions apply:
33 (1) The court may order the juvenile offender to participate in
34 counseling or mediation sessions or a program of education, including
35 placement in an alternative educational program approved by a local
36 school board. The costs of any counseling or mediation may be assessed as
37 expenses in the case. No mental health center shall charge a fee for court-
38 ordered counseling greater than what the center would have charged the
39 person receiving the counseling if the person had requested counseling on
40 the person's own initiative. No mediator shall charge a fee for court-
41 ordered mediation greater than what the mediator would have charged the
42 person participating in the mediation if the person had requested mediation
43 on the person's own initiative. Mediation may include the victim but shall
HB 2329—Am. by HC 4
1 not be mandatory for the victim; and
2 (2) if the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile by reason of a
3 violation of a statute that makes such a requirement, the court shall order
4 and, if adjudicated for any other offense, the court may order the juvenile
5 to submit to and complete a drug and alcohol evaluation by a community-
6 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
7 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
8 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
9 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
10 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
11 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
12 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
13 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
14 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
15 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
16 the fee. In no event shall the fee be assessed against the secretary of
17 corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be assessed
18 against the secretary of the department for children and families or the
19 Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
20 secretary's care, custody and control.
21 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
22 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
23 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
24 provisions apply:
25 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
26 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
27 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
28 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
29 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
30 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
31 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
32 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
33 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
34 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
35 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
36 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
37 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
38 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
39 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
40 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
41 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
42 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
43 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
HB 2329—Am. by HC 5
1 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
2 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
3 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
4 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
5 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
6 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
7 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
8 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
9 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
10 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
11 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
12 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
13 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
14 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
15 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
16 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
17 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
18 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
19 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
20 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
21 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
22 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
23 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
24 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
25 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
26 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
27 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
28 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
29 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
30 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
31 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
32 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
33 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
34 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
35 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
36 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
37 conditions.
38 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
39 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
40 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
41 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
42 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
43 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
HB 2329—Am. by HC 6
1 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
2 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
3 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
4 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
5 organizations performing services for the community; and
6 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
7 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
8 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
9 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
10 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
11 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
12 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
13 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
14 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
15 following provisions apply:
16 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
17 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
18 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
19 lump sum or installments;
20 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
21 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
22 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
23 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
24 imposition of a fine; and
25 (3) any fine imposed by the court shall be a judgment against the
26 juvenile that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other
27 execution as on judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be
28 affected by the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
29 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
30 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
31 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
32 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
33 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
34 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
35 (g) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
36 subsection (a)(11), the following provisions shall apply:
37 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
38 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
39 exhausted.
40 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
41 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
42 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
43 new felony offense, or violates conditional release.
HB 2329—Am. by HC 7
1 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
2 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
3 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
4 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
5 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
6 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
7 days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
8 2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
9 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
10 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
11 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 days or
12 the overall case length limit.
13 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
14 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
15 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
16 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
17 facility.
18 (h) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be in
19 effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
20 (i) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
21 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
22 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
23 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
24 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
25 within 30 days of final disposition.
26 (j) (1) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to
27 be a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult
28 would constitute the commission of: (1) (A) Aggravated human
29 trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if
30 the victim is less than 14 years of age; (2) (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A.
31 21-5503(a)(3), and amendments thereto; (3) (C) aggravated indecent
32 liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5506(b)(3), and amendments
33 thereto; (4) (D) aggravated criminal sodomy, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
34 5504(b)(1) or (b)(2), and amendments thereto; (5) (E) commercial sexual
35 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments
36 thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; (6) (F) sexual
37 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and
38 amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; or (7) (G)
39 an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
40 5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an offense defined
41 in paragraphs (1) through (6); subparagraphs (A) through (F).
42 (2) The court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from
43 attending the attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If
HB 2329—Am. by HC 8
1 only one attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are
2 eligible to attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile
3 reside, the court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim,
4 the juvenile, their families and a representative of the school district as to
5 why the juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the
6 attendance center attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may
7 issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center
8 that the victim of the offense attends.
9 (k) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
10 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
11 foster home or community integration program if:
12 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
13 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
14 commission of:
15 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
16 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;
17 (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503, and amendments thereto;
18 (C) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A.
19 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
20 age;
21 (D) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1)
22 or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
23 age;
24 (E) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A.
25 21-5506, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
26 age; or
27 (F) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in
28 K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an
29 offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (4) subparagraphs (A) through
30 (E); and
31 (2) (A) the victim resides in the same home as the juvenile offender;
32 (B) a community supervision officer in consultation with the
33 department for children and families determines that an adequate safety
34 plan, which shall include the physical and psychological well-being of the
35 victim, cannot be developed to keep the juvenile in the same home; and
36 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
37 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
38 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
39 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
40 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
41 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
42 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
43 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
HB 2329—Am. by HC 9
1 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
2 initial order of the court.
3 (l) If the court orders a short-term alternative placement of a juvenile
4 pursuant to subsection (k), the secretary shall be responsible for the costs
5 associated with all aspects of such placement. The secretary shall contract
6 with emergency shelters and therapeutic foster homes in order to facilitate
7 the placement of juvenile offenders pursuant to subsection (k).
8 (m) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided in
9 K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.
10 (m)(n) The overall case length limit shall be calculated by the court
11 and entered into the written record when one or more of the sentencing
12 options under this section are imposed. The period fixed by the court
13 pursuant to subsection (a) shall not extend beyond the overall case length
14 limit.
15 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 38-2365 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
16 2365. (a) When a juvenile offender has been placed in the custody of the
17 secretary, the secretary shall have a reasonable time to make a placement.
18 If the juvenile offender has not been placed, any party who believes that
19 the amount of time elapsed without placement has exceeded a reasonable
20 time may file a motion for review with the court. In determining what is a
21 reasonable amount of time, matters considered by the court shall include,
22 but not be limited to, the nature of the underlying offense, efforts made for
23 placement of the juvenile offender and the availability of a suitable
24 placement. The secretary shall notify the court, the juvenile's attorney of
25 record and the juvenile's parent, in writing, of the initial placement and any
26 subsequent change of placement as soon as the placement has been
27 accomplished. The notice to the juvenile offender's parent shall be sent to
28 such parent's last known address or addresses. Except as provided in
29 K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the court shall have no power to direct a specific
30 placement by the secretary, but may make recommendations to the
31 secretary. Except as provided in K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the secretary may
32 place the juvenile offender in an institution operated by the secretary, a
33 youth residential facility or any other appropriate placement. If the court
34 has recommended an out-of-home placement, the secretary may not return
35 the juvenile offender to the home from which removed without first
36 notifying the court of the plan.
37 (b) If a juvenile is in the custody of the secretary, the secretary shall
38 prepare and present a permanency plan at sentencing or within 30 days
39 thereafter. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older and the juvenile is
40 able, the secretary shall prepare the permanency plan in consultation with
41 the juvenile. If a permanency plan is already in place under a child in need
42 of care proceeding, the court may adopt the plan under the present
43 proceeding. The written permanency plan shall provide for reintegration of
HB 2329—Am. by HC 10
1 the juvenile into such juvenile's family or, if reintegration is not a viable
2 alternative, for other permanent placement of the juvenile. Reintegration
3 may not be a viable alternative when: (1) The parent has been found by a
4 court to have committed murder in the first degree, K.S.A. 21-3401, prior
5 to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments thereto, murder in the
6 second degree, K.S.A. 21-3402, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5403, and
7 amendments thereto, capital murder, K.S.A. 21-3439, prior to its repeal, or
8 K.S.A. 21-5401, and amendments thereto, voluntary manslaughter, K.S.A.
9 21-3403, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5404, and amendments thereto,
10 of a child or violated a law of another state which prohibits such murder or
11 manslaughter of a child;
12 (2) the parent aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to
13 commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter of a child;
14 (3) the parent committed a felony battery that resulted in bodily
15 injury to the juvenile who is the subject of this proceeding or another
16 child;
17 (4) the parent has subjected the juvenile who is the subject of this
18 proceeding or another child to aggravated circumstances as defined in
19 K.S.A. 38-1502, and amendments thereto;
20 (5) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been
21 terminated involuntarily; or
22 (6) the juvenile has been in extended out-of-home placement as
23 defined in K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto.
24 (c) If the juvenile is placed in the custody of the secretary, the plan
25 shall be prepared and submitted by the secretary. If the juvenile is placed
26 in the custody of a facility or person other than the secretary, the plan shall
27 be prepared and submitted by a court services officer. If the permanency
28 goal is reintegration into the family, the permanency plan shall include
29 measurable objectives and time schedules for reintegration.
30 (d) During the time a juvenile remains in the custody of the secretary,
31 the secretary shall submit to the court, at least every six months, a written
32 report of the progress being made toward the goals of the permanency plan
33 submitted pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and the specific actions taken
34 to achieve the goals of the permanency plan. If the juvenile is placed in
35 foster care, the court may request the foster parent to submit to the court,
36 at least every six months, a report in regard to the juvenile's adjustment,
37 progress and condition. Such report shall be made a part of the juvenile's
38 court social file. The court shall review the plan submitted by the secretary
39 and the report, if any, submitted by the foster parent and determine
40 whether reasonable efforts and progress have been made to achieve the
41 goals of the permanency plan. If the court determines that progress is
42 inadequate or that the permanency plan is no longer viable, the court shall
43 hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (e).
HB 2329—Am. by HC 11
1 (e) When the secretary has custody of the juvenile, a permanency
2 hearing shall be held no more than 12 months after the juvenile is first
3 placed outside such juvenile's home and at least every 12 months
4 thereafter. Juvenile offenders who have been in extended out-of-home
5 placement shall be provided a permanency hearing within 30 days of a
6 request from the secretary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
7 represent the juvenile offender at the permanency hearing. At the
8 permanency hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable,
9 when the juvenile will be:
10 (1) Reintegrated with the juvenile's parents;
11 (2) placed for adoption;
12 (3) placed with a permanent custodian; or
13 (4) if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and the secretary has
14 documented compelling reasons why it would not be in the juvenile's best
15 interests for a placement in one of the placements pursuant to paragraphs
16 (1), (2) or (3), placed in another planned permanent arrangement.
17 (f) At each permanency hearing, the court shall:
18 (1) Make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been
19 made to accomplish the permanency goal and whether continued out-of-
20 home placement is necessary for the juvenile's safety;
21 (2) make a written finding as to whether the reasonable and prudent
22 parenting standard has been met and whether the juvenile has regular,
23 ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
24 activities. The secretary shall report to the court the steps the secretary is
25 taking to ensure that the reasonable and prudent parenting standard is
26 being met and that the juvenile has regular, ongoing opportunities to
27 engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including
28 consultation with the juvenile in an age-appropriate manner about the
29 opportunities of the juvenile to participate in the activities; and
30 (3) if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, document the efforts
31 made by the secretary to help the juvenile prepare for the transition from
32 custody to a successful adulthood. The secretary shall report to the court
33 the programs and services that are being provided to the juvenile which
34 will help the juvenile prepare for the transition from custody to a
35 successful adulthood.
36 (g) The requirements of this subsection shall apply only if the
37 permanency goal in place at the time of the hearing is another planned
38 permanent arrangement as described in subsection (e)(4). At each
39 permanency hearing held with respect to the juvenile, in addition to the
40 requirements of subsection (f), the court shall:
41 (1) Ask the juvenile, if the juvenile is able, by attendance at the
42 hearing or by report to the court, about the desired permanency outcome
43 for the juvenile;
HB 2329—Am. by HC 12
1 (2) document the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
2 unsuccessful permanency efforts made by the secretary to return the
3 juvenile home or secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing
4 relative, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent. The secretary shall report
5 to the court the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
6 unsuccessful efforts made by the secretary to return the juvenile home or
7 secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing relative, a legal
8 guardian or an adoptive parent, including efforts that utilize search
9 technology, including social media, to find biological family members of
10 the children; and
11 (3) make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of
12 the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
13 permanency plan for the juvenile and provide compelling reasons why it
14 continues to not be in the best interests of the juvenile to return home, be
15 placed for adoption, be placed with a legal guardian or be placed with a fit
16 and willing relative.
17 (h) Whenever a hearing is required under subsection (e), the court
18 shall notify all interested parties of the hearing date, the secretary, foster
19 parent and preadoptive parent or relatives providing care for the juvenile
20 and hold a hearing. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, the court
21 shall require notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing be
22 given to the juvenile. Such notice shall request the juvenile's participation
23 in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. Individuals receiving
24 notice pursuant to this subsection shall not be made a party to the action
25 solely on the basis of this notice and opportunity to be heard. After
26 providing the persons receiving notice an opportunity to be heard, the
27 court shall determine whether the juvenile's needs are being adequately
28 met; whether services set out in the permanency plan necessary for the
29 safe return of the juvenile have been made available to the parent with
30 whom reintegration is planned; and whether reasonable efforts and
31 progress have been made to achieve the goals of the permanency plan.
32 (i) If the court finds reintegration continues to be a viable alternative,
33 the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the juvenile will
34 be returned to the parent. The court may rescind any of its prior
35 dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized by this
36 code or may order that a new plan for the reintegration be prepared and
37 submitted to the court. If reintegration cannot be accomplished as
38 approved by the court, the court shall be informed and shall schedule a
39 hearing pursuant to subsection (j). No such hearing is required when the
40 parent voluntarily relinquishes parental rights or agrees to appointment of
41 a permanent guardian.
42 (j) When the court finds any of the following conditions exist, the
43 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee shall
HB 2329—Am. by HC 13
1 file a petition alleging the juvenile to be a child in need of care and
2 requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to the Kansas code for
3 care of children:
4 (1) The court determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative
5 and either adoption or permanent guardianship might be in the best
6 interests of the juvenile;
7 (2) the goal of the permanency plan is reintegration into the family
8 and the court determines after 12 months from the time such plan is first
9 submitted that progress is inadequate; or
10 (3) the juvenile has been in out-of-home placement for a cumulative
11 total of 15 of the last 22 months, excluding trial home visits and juvenile in
12 runaway status.
13 Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit termination of
14 parental rights prior to the expiration of 12 months.
15 (k) A petition to terminate parental rights is not required to be filed if
16 one of the following exceptions is documented to exist:
17 (1) The juvenile is in a stable placement with relatives;
18 (2) services set out in the case plan necessary for the safe return of
19 the juvenile have not been made available to the parent with whom
20 reintegration is planned; or
21 (3) there are one or more documented reasons why such filing would
22 not be in the best interests of the juvenile. Documented reasons may
23 include, but are not limited to: The juvenile has close emotional bonds
24 with a parent which should not be broken; the juvenile is 14 years of age
25 or older and, after advice and counsel, refuses to be adopted; insufficient
26 grounds exist for termination of parental rights; the juvenile is an
27 unaccompanied refugee minor; or there are international legal or
28 compelling foreign policy reasons precluding termination of parental
29 rights.
30 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 38-2369 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
31 2369. (a) Except as provided in subsection (e) and K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13),
32 and amendments thereto, for the purpose of committing juvenile
33 offenders to a juvenile correctional facility, upon a finding by the judge
34 entered into the written order that the juvenile poses a significant risk of
35 harm to another or damage to property, the following placements shall be
36 applied by the judge in the cases specified in this subsection. If used, the
37 court shall establish a specific term of commitment as specified in this
38 subsection. The term of commitment established by the court shall not
39 exceed the overall case length limit. Before a juvenile offender is
40 committed to a juvenile correctional facility pursuant to this section, the
41 court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as described in K.S.A. 38-
42 2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk assessment tool that was
43 administered within the past six months to the juvenile.

10 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
11 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
12 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. The
13 secretary shall ensure timely placement of such offender in a youth
14 residential facility and shall be responsible for the costs associated with
15 all aspects of such placement in accordance with K.S.A. 38-2399, and
16 amendments thereto, This presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the
17 record that the juvenile offender poses a significant risk of physical harm
18 to another.
19 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2391 is hereby amended to read as
20 follows: 38-2391. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender
21 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and amendments thereto, modification of
22 sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367, and amendments thereto, or
23 violation of a condition of sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and

26 thereto, for a period of time pursuant to this section and K.S.A. 38-
27 2369, and amendments thereto. The period of time ordered by the
28 court shall not exceed the overall case length limit.
29 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the overall case length
30 limit shall be calculated based on the adjudicated offense and the
31 results of a risk and needs assessment, as follows:
32 (1) Offenders adjudicated for a misdemeanor may remain under
33 the jurisdiction of the court for up to 12 months;
34 (2) low-risk and moderate-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony
35 may remain under court jurisdiction for up to 15 months; and
36 (3) high-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may remain
37 under court jurisdiction for up to 18 months.
38 (c) There shall be no overall case length limit for a juvenile
39 adjudicated for a felony which, if committed by an adult, would
40 constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1 through 4
41 person felony.
42 (d) When a juvenile is adjudicated for multiple counts, the
43 maximum overall case length shall be calculated based on the most
HB 2329—Am. by HC 17
1 severe adjudicated count or any other adjudicated count at the court's
2 discretion. The court shall not run multiple adjudicated counts
3 consecutively.
4 (e) When the juvenile is adjudicated for multiple cases
5 simultaneously, the court shall run such cases concurrently.
6 (f) Upon expiration of the overall case length limit as defined in
7 subsection (b), the court's jurisdiction terminates and shall not be
8 extended, except as provided in subsection (g)(2).
9 (g) (1) For the purposes of placing juvenile offenders on
10 probation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361, and amendments thereto, the
11 court shall establish a specific term of probation as specified in this

14 follows, except that the term of probation shall not exceed the overall
15 case length limit:
16 (A) Low-risk and moderate-risk offenders adjudicated for a

20 moderate-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be placed on
21 probation for a term up to nine months; and
22 (C) high-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be placed on
23 probation for a term up to 12 months.
24 (2) The court may extend the term of probation if a juvenile
25 needs time to complete an evidence-based program as determined to
26 be necessary based on the results of a validated risk and needs
27 assessment and, if necessary, may extend the overall case length limit
28 to allow for completion of such program when failure to complete such
29 program is due to a repeated, intentional effort to delay by the
30 juvenile as reported by the evidence-based services provider. The
31 court may also extend the term of probation for good cause shown for
32 one month for low-risk offenders, three months for moderate-risk
33 offenders and six months for high-risk offenders. Prior to extension of
34 the initial probationary term, the court shall find and enter into the
35 written record the criteria permitting extension of probation.
36 Extensions of probation and the overall case length limit shall only be
37 granted incrementally. When the court extends the term of probation
38 for a juvenile offender, the court services officer or community
39 correctional services officer responsible for monitoring such juvenile
40 offender shall record the reason given for extending probation. Court
41 services officers shall report such records to the office of judicial
42 administration, and community correctional services officers shall
43 report such records to the department of corrections. The office of
HB 2329—Am. by HC 18
1 judicial administration and the department of corrections shall report
2 such recorded data to the Kansas juvenile justice oversight committee
3 on a quarterly basis.
4 (3) The probation term limits do not apply to those offenders
5 adjudicated for an offense which, if committed by an adult, would
6 constitute an off-grid crime, rape as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503(a)(1),
7 and amendments thereto, aggravated criminal sodomy as defined in
8 K.S.A. 21-5504(b)(3), and amendments thereto, or murder in the
9 second degree as defined in K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto.
10 Such offenders may be placed on probation for a term consistent with
11 the overall case length limit.
12 (4) The probation term limits and overall case length limits
13 provided in this section shall be tolled during any time that the
14 offender has absconded from supervision while on probation, and the
15 time on such limits shall not start to run again until the offender is
16 located and brought back to the jurisdiction.
17 (h) For the purpose of placing juvenile offenders in detention
18 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361 and 38-2369, and amendments thereto, the
19 court shall establish a specific term of detention. The term of detention
20 shall not exceed the overall case length limit or the cumulative
21 detention limit. Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a
22 maximum of 45 90 days over the course of the juvenile offender's case,
23 except that there shall be no limit on cumulative detention for juvenile
24 offenders adjudicated for a felony which, if committed by an adult,
25 would constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1
26 through 4 person felony.
27 (i) The provisions of this section shall apply upon disposition or
28 15 days after adjudication, whichever is sooner, unless the juvenile
29 fails to appear for such juvenile's dispositional hearing. If a juvenile
30 fails to appear at such juvenile's dispositional hearing, the probation
31 term limits and overall case length limits provided in this section shall
32 not apply until the juvenile is brought before the court for disposition
33 in such juvenile's case.
34 (j) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
35 Kansas juvenile justice code.
36 Sec. 4. 5. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-

21 youth residential facilities for placement of juvenile offenders as required
22 in K.S.A. 38-2399, and amendments thereto.
23 (3)(5) All expenditures from the evidence-based programs account of

27 designee.
28 (b) At least annually, throughout the year, the secretary of corrections
29 shall determine and certify to the director of accounts and reports the
30 amount in each account of the state general fund of a state agency that has
31 been determined by the secretary to be actual or projected cost savings as a
32 result of cost avoidance resulting from decreased reliance on incarceration
33 in the juvenile correctional facility and placement in youth residential
34 centers. The baseline shall be calculated on the cost of incarceration and

36 (c) Upon receipt of a certification pursuant to subsection (b), the

16 receive grants under this subsection.
17 (f) Expenditures made from the evidence-based programs account of

23 (g) The evidence-based programs account of the state general fund
24 and any other moneys transferred pursuant to this section shall be used for

28 forth in this section.
29 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 75-7023 is hereby amended to read as follows: 75-
30 7023. (a) The secretary for children and families may contract with the

32 assessment system and programs for children in need of care. Except
33 as provided further, the secretary of corrections shall promulgate
34 rules and regulations for the juvenile intake and assessment system
35 and programs concerning juvenile offenders. If the secretary contracts
36 with the office of judicial administration to administer the juvenile
37 intake and assessment system and programs concerning juvenile
38 offenders, the supreme court administrative orders shall be in force
39 until such contract ends and the rules and regulations concerning
40 juvenile intake and assessment system and programs concerning
41 juvenile offenders have been adopted.
42 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, records,
43 reports and information obtained as a part of the juvenile intake and
HB 2329—Am. by HC 25
1 assessment process shall not be admitted into evidence in any
2 proceeding and shall not be used in a child in need of care proceeding
3 or a juvenile offender proceeding.
4 (1) Such records, reports and information may be used in a child
5 in need of care proceeding for diagnostic and referral purposes and by
6 the court in considering dispositional alternatives. If the records,
7 reports or information are in regard to abuse or neglect, which is
8 required to be reported under K.S.A. 38-2223, and amendments
9 thereto, such records, reports or information may then be used for any
10 purpose in a child in need of care proceeding pursuant to the revised
11 Kansas code for care of children.
12 (2) Such records, reports and information may be used in a
13 juvenile offender proceeding only if such records, reports and
14 information are in regard to the possible trafficking of a runaway.
15 Such records, reports and information in regard to the possible
16 trafficking of a runaway shall be made available to the appropriate
17 county or district attorney and the court, and shall be used only for
18 diagnostic and referral purposes.
19 (c) Upon a juvenile being taken into custody pursuant to K.S.A.
20 38-2330, and amendments thereto, a juvenile intake and assessment
21 worker shall complete the intake and assessment process, making
22 release and referral determinations as required by supreme court
23 administrative order or district court rule, or except as provided
24 above [in] rules and regulations established by the secretary of
25 corrections.
26 (d) Except as provided in subsection (g) and in addition to any
27 other information required by the supreme court administrative
28 order, the secretary for children and families, the secretary of
29 corrections or by the district court of such district, the juvenile intake
30 and assessment worker shall collect the following information either in
31 person or over two-way audio or audio-visual communication:
32 (1) The results of a standardized detention risk assessment tool
33 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2302, and amendments thereto, if detention is
34 being considered for the juvenile, such as the problem oriented
35 screening instrument for teens;
36 (2) criminal history, including indications of criminal gang
37 involvement;
38 (3) abuse history;
39 (4) substance abuse history;
40 (5) history of prior community services used or treatments
41 provided;
42 (6) educational history;
43 (7) medical history;
HB 2329—Am. by HC 26
1 (8) family history; and
2 (9) the results of other assessment instruments as approved by the
3 secretary.
4 (e) After completion of the intake and assessment process for
5 such child, the intake and assessment worker shall make both a
6 release and a referral determination:
7 (1) Release the child to the custody of the child's parent, other
8 legal guardian or another appropriate adult.
9 (2) Conditionally release the child to the child's parent, other
10 legal guardian or another appropriate adult if the intake and
11 assessment worker believes that if the conditions are met, it would be
12 in the child's best interest to release the child to such child's parent,
13 other legal guardian or another appropriate adult; and the intake and
14 assessment worker has reason to believe that it might be harmful to
15 the child to release the child to such child's parents, other legal
16 guardian or another appropriate adult without imposing the
17 conditions. The conditions may include, but not be limited to the
18 alternatives listed in K.S.A. 38-2331(b), and amendments thereto, and
19 the following:
20 (A) Participation of the child in counseling;
21 (B) participation of members of the child's family in counseling;
22 (C) participation by the child, members of the child's family and

31 (G) requiring the child and members of the child's family to enter
32 into a behavioral contract which may provide for regular school
33 attendance among other requirements; or

35 future abuse or neglect.
36 (3) Deliver the child to a shelter facility or a licensed attendant
37 care center along with the law enforcement officer's written
38 application for a maximum stay of up to 72 hours. The shelter facility
39 or licensed attendant care facility shall then have custody as if the
40 child had been directly delivered to the facility by the law enforcement
41 officer pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2232, and amendments thereto.
42 (4) The intake and assessment worker shall also refer the
43 juvenile's case to one of the following:

1 (A) An immediate intervention program pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
2 2346(b), and amendments thereto;
3 (B) the county or district attorney for appropriate proceedings to
4 be filed, with or without a recommendation that the juvenile be
5 considered for alternative means of adjudication programs pursuant
6 to K.S.A. 38-2389, and amendments thereto, or immediate
7 intervention pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto; or
8 (C) refer the child and family to the secretary for children and
9 families for investigations in regard to the allegations.
10 (f) The secretary of corrections, in conjunction with the office of
11 judicial administration, shall develop, implement and validate on the

14 consideration for detention and may only be conducted by a juvenile
15 intake and assessment worker who has completed training to conduct
16 the detention risk assessment tool.
17 (2) The secretary and the office of judicial administration shall
18 establish cutoff scores determining eligibility for placement in a
19 juvenile detention facility or for referral to a community-based
20 alternative to detention and shall collect and report data regarding the
21 use of the detention risk assessment tool.
22 (3) (A) The detention risk assessment tool includes an override
23 function that may be approved by the court for use under certain
24 circumstances. If approved by the court, the juvenile intake and
25 assessment worker or the court may override the detention risk
26 assessment tool score in order to direct placement in a short-term
27 shelter facility, a community-based alternative to detention or, subject
28 to K.S.A. 38-2331, and amendments thereto, a juvenile detention
29 facility. Such override must be documented, include a written
30 explanation and receive approval from the director of the intake and
31 assessment center or the court.
32 (B) The court shall approve an override function of the detention risk
33 assessment tool for use when a juvenile is alleged to have possessed or
34 used a firearm during the commission of an offense. In such an instance,
35 the juvenile intake and assessment worker or the court shall place such
36 juvenile in a juvenile detention facility.
37 (4) If a juvenile meets one or more eligibility criteria for detention
38 or referral to a community-based alternative to detention, the person
39 with authority to detain shall maintain discretion to release the
40 juvenile if other less restrictive measures would be adequate.
41 (g) Parents, guardians and juveniles may access the juvenile
42 intake and assessment programs on a voluntary basis. The parent or
43 guardian shall be responsible for the costs of any such program
HB 2329—Am. by HC 28
1 utilized.
2 (h) Every juvenile intake and assessment worker shall receive
3 training in evidence-based practices, including, but not limited to:
4 (1) Risk and needs assessments;
5 (2) individualized diversions based on needs and strengths;
6 (3) graduated responses;
7 (4) family engagement;
8 (5) trauma-informed care;
9 (6) substance abuse;
10 (7) mental health; and
11 (8) special education.

13 52,161 and 75-7023 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2391 and 75-52,164 are

17 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
18 Section 1. K.S.A. 38-2361 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
19 2361. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
20 2356, and amendments thereto, modification of sentence pursuant to
21 K.S.A. 38-2367, and amendments thereto, or violation of a condition of
22 sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto, the court
23 may impose one or more of the following sentencing alternatives for a
24 fixed period pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments
25 thereto.
26 (1) Place the juvenile on probation for a fixed period pursuant to
27 K.S.A. 38-2391, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
28 the court deems appropriate consistent with juvenile justice programs in
29 the community. Any juvenile placed on probation shall be supervised
30 according to the juvenile's risk and needs as determined by a risk and
31 needs assessment. Placement of juvenile offenders to community
32 corrections for probation supervision shall be limited to offenders
33 adjudicated for an offense that are determined to be moderate-risk, high-
34 risk or very high-risk on a risk and needs assessment using the cutoff
35 scores established by the secretary pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2360, and

HB 2329—Am. by HC 2
1 amendments thereto.
2 (2) Order the juvenile to participate in a community based program
3 available in such judicial district subject to the terms and conditions the
4 court deems appropriate. This alternative shall not be ordered with the
5 alternative in paragraph (11). Requirements pertaining to child support
6 may apply if custody is vested with other than a parent.
7 (3) Place the juvenile in the custody of a parent or other suitable
8 person, which is not a group home youth residential facility or other
9 facility licensed pursuant to article 5 of chapter 65 of the Kansas Statutes
10 Annotated, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
11 consistent with juvenile justice programs in the community. This
12 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (10) or
13 (11). Requirements pertaining to child support may apply if custody is
14 vested with other than a parent.
15 (4) Order the juvenile to attend counseling, educational, mediation or
16 other sessions, or to undergo a drug evaluation pursuant to subsection (b).
17 (5) Suspend or restrict the juvenile's driver's license or privilege to
18 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state pursuant
19 to subsection (c).
20 (6) Order the juvenile to perform charitable or community service
21 work.
22 (7) Order the juvenile to make appropriate reparation or restitution
23 pursuant to subsection (d).
24 (8) Order the juvenile to pay a fine not exceeding $1,000 pursuant to
25 subsection (e).
26 (9) Place the juvenile under a house arrest program administered by
27 the court pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto.
28 (10) Place the juvenile in the custody of the secretary of corrections
29 as provided in K.S.A. 38-2365, and amendments thereto, and order the
30 secretary to place the juvenile in a youth residential facility. This
31 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (3) or
32 (12). Except for mandatory drug and alcohol evaluation, when this
33 alternative is ordered with alternatives in paragraphs (2), (4) and (9), such
34 orders shall constitute a recommendation by the court. Requirements
35 pertaining to child support shall apply under this alternative. The
36 provisions of this paragraph shall expire on January 1, 2018.
37 (11) Upon a violation of a condition of sentence, other than a
38 technical violation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto,
39 commit the juvenile to detention for a period no longer than 30 days
40 subject to the provisions of subsection (g).
41 (12) If the judge finds and enters into the written record that the
42 juvenile poses a significant risk of harm to another or damage to property,
43 and the juvenile is otherwise eligible for commitment pursuant to K.S.A.

HB 2329—Am. by HC 3
1 38-2369, and amendments thereto, commit the juvenile directly to the
2 custody of the secretary of corrections for placement in a juvenile
3 correctional facility or a youth residential facility. Placement in a youth
4 residential facility shall only be permitted as authorized in K.S.A. 38-
5 2369(e), and amendments thereto. If the court elects, a period of
6 conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
7 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
8 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
9 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
10 facility, the secretary of corrections or designee shall notify the court of the
11 juvenile's anticipated release date. This alternative may be ordered with the
12 alternative in paragraph (7). Requirements pertaining to child support shall
13 apply under this alternative.
14 (13) Upon a finding by the trier of fact during adjudication that a
15 firearm was possessed or used in during the commission of an offense by
16 the accused which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, a
17 judge may commit the juvenile directly to the custody of the secretary of
18 corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility or youth
19 residential facility for a minimum term of six 12 months and up to a
20 maximum term of 18 24 months, regardless of the risk level of such
21 juvenile as determined by a risk and needs assessment. If the juvenile is
22 committed to the custody of the secretary, and the court elects, a period of
23 conditional release, pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
24 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
25 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
26 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
27 facility or youth residential facility, the secretary of corrections or the
28 secretary's designee shall notify the court of the juvenile's anticipated
29 release date.
30 (b) If the court orders the juvenile to attend counseling, educational,
31 mediation or other sessions, or to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation
32 pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the following provisions apply:
33 (1) The court may order the juvenile offender to participate in
34 counseling or mediation sessions or a program of education, including
35 placement in an alternative educational program approved by a local
36 school board. The costs of any counseling or mediation may be assessed as
37 expenses in the case. No mental health center shall charge a fee for court-
38 ordered counseling greater than what the center would have charged the
39 person receiving the counseling if the person had requested counseling on
40 the person's own initiative. No mediator shall charge a fee for court-
41 ordered mediation greater than what the mediator would have charged the
42 person participating in the mediation if the person had requested mediation
43 on the person's own initiative. Mediation may include the victim but shall

HB 2329—Am. by HC 4
1 not be mandatory for the victim; and
2 (2) if the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile by reason of a
3 violation of a statute that makes such a requirement, the court shall order
4 and, if adjudicated for any other offense, the court may order the juvenile
5 to submit to and complete a drug and alcohol evaluation by a community-
6 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
7 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
8 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
9 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
10 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
11 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
12 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
13 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
14 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
15 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
16 the fee. In no event shall the fee be assessed against the secretary of
17 corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be assessed
18 against the secretary of the department for children and families or the
19 Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
20 secretary's care, custody and control.
21 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
22 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
23 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
24 provisions apply:
25 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
26 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
27 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
28 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
29 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
30 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
31 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
32 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
33 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
34 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
35 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
36 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
37 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
38 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
39 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
40 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
41 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
42 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
43 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or

HB 2329—Am. by HC 5
1 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
2 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
3 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
4 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
5 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
6 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
7 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
8 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
9 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
10 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
11 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
12 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
13 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
14 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
15 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
16 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
17 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
18 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
19 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
20 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
21 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
22 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
23 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
24 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
25 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
26 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
27 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
28 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
29 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
30 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
31 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
32 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
33 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
34 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
35 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
36 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
37 conditions.
38 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
39 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
40 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
41 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
42 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
43 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds

HB 2329—Am. by HC 6
1 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
2 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
3 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
4 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
5 organizations performing services for the community; and
6 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
7 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
8 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
9 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
10 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
11 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
12 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
13 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
14 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
15 following provisions apply:
16 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
17 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
18 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
19 lump sum or installments;
20 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
21 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
22 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
23 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
24 imposition of a fine; and
25 (3) any fine imposed by the court shall be a judgment against the
26 juvenile that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other
27 execution as on judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be
28 affected by the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
29 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
30 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
31 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
32 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
33 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
34 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
35 (g) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
36 subsection (a)(11), the following provisions shall apply:
37 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
38 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
39 exhausted.
40 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
41 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
42 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
43 new felony offense, or violates conditional release.

HB 2329—Am. by HC 7
1 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
2 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
3 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
4 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
5 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
6 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
7 days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
8 2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
9 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
10 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
11 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 days or
12 the overall case length limit.
13 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
14 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
15 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
16 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
17 facility.
18 (h) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be in
19 effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
20 (i) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
21 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
22 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
23 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
24 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
25 within 30 days of final disposition.
26 (j) (1) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to
27 be a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult
28 would constitute the commission of: (1) (A) Aggravated human
29 trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if
30 the victim is less than 14 years of age; (2) (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A.
31 21-5503(a)(3), and amendments thereto; (3) (C) aggravated indecent
32 liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5506(b)(3), and amendments
33 thereto; (4) (D) aggravated criminal sodomy, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
34 5504(b)(1) or (b)(2), and amendments thereto; (5) (E) commercial sexual
35 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments
36 thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; (6) (F) sexual
37 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and
38 amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; or (7) (G)
39 an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
40 5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an offense defined
41 in paragraphs (1) through (6); subparagraphs (A) through (F).
42 (2) The court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from
43 attending the attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If

HB 2329—Am. by HC 8
1 only one attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are
2 eligible to attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile
3 reside, the court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim,
4 the juvenile, their families and a representative of the school district as to
5 why the juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the
6 attendance center attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may
7 issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center
8 that the victim of the offense attends.
9 (k) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
10 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
11 foster home or community integration program if:
12 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
13 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
14 commission of:
15 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
16 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;
17 (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503, and amendments thereto;
18 (C) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A.
19 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
20 age;
21 (D) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1)
22 or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
23 age;
24 (E) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A.
25 21-5506, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
26 age; or
27 (F) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in
28 K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an
29 offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (4) subparagraphs (A) through
30 (E); and
31 (2) (A) the victim resides in the same home as the juvenile offender;
32 (B) a community supervision officer in consultation with the
33 department for children and families determines that an adequate safety
34 plan, which shall include the physical and psychological well-being of the
35 victim, cannot be developed to keep the juvenile in the same home; and
36 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
37 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
38 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
39 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
40 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
41 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
42 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
43 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and

HB 2329—Am. by HC 9
1 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
2 initial order of the court.
3 (l) If the court orders a short-term alternative placement of a juvenile
4 pursuant to subsection (k), the secretary shall be responsible for the costs
5 associated with all aspects of such placement. The secretary shall contract
6 with emergency shelters and therapeutic foster homes in order to facilitate
7 the placement of juvenile offenders pursuant to subsection (k).
8 (m) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided in
9 K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.
10 (m)(n) The overall case length limit shall be calculated by the court
11 and entered into the written record when one or more of the sentencing
12 options under this section are imposed. The period fixed by the court
13 pursuant to subsection (a) shall not extend beyond the overall case length
14 limit.
15 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 38-2365 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
16 2365. (a) When a juvenile offender has been placed in the custody of the
17 secretary, the secretary shall have a reasonable time to make a placement.
18 If the juvenile offender has not been placed, any party who believes that
19 the amount of time elapsed without placement has exceeded a reasonable
20 time may file a motion for review with the court. In determining what is a
21 reasonable amount of time, matters considered by the court shall include,
22 but not be limited to, the nature of the underlying offense, efforts made for
23 placement of the juvenile offender and the availability of a suitable
24 placement. The secretary shall notify the court, the juvenile's attorney of
25 record and the juvenile's parent, in writing, of the initial placement and any
26 subsequent change of placement as soon as the placement has been
27 accomplished. The notice to the juvenile offender's parent shall be sent to
28 such parent's last known address or addresses. Except as provided in
29 K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the court shall have no power to direct a specific
30 placement by the secretary, but may make recommendations to the
31 secretary. Except as provided in K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the secretary may
32 place the juvenile offender in an institution operated by the secretary, a
33 youth residential facility or any other appropriate placement. If the court
34 has recommended an out-of-home placement, the secretary may not return
35 the juvenile offender to the home from which removed without first
36 notifying the court of the plan.
37 (b) If a juvenile is in the custody of the secretary, the secretary shall
38 prepare and present a permanency plan at sentencing or within 30 days
39 thereafter. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older and the juvenile is
40 able, the secretary shall prepare the permanency plan in consultation with
41 the juvenile. If a permanency plan is already in place under a child in need
42 of care proceeding, the court may adopt the plan under the present
43 proceeding. The written permanency plan shall provide for reintegration of

HB 2329—Am. by HC 10
1 the juvenile into such juvenile's family or, if reintegration is not a viable
2 alternative, for other permanent placement of the juvenile. Reintegration
3 may not be a viable alternative when: (1) The parent has been found by a
4 court to have committed murder in the first degree, K.S.A. 21-3401, prior

11 manslaughter of a child;
12 (2) the parent aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to
13 commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter of a child;
14 (3) the parent committed a felony battery that resulted in bodily
15 injury to the juvenile who is the subject of this proceeding or another
16 child;
17 (4) the parent has subjected the juvenile who is the subject of this
18 proceeding or another child to aggravated circumstances as defined in
19 K.S.A. 38-1502, and amendments thereto;
20 (5) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been
21 terminated involuntarily; or
22 (6) the juvenile has been in extended out-of-home placement as
23 defined in K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto.
24 (c) If the juvenile is placed in the custody of the secretary, the plan
25 shall be prepared and submitted by the secretary. If the juvenile is placed
26 in the custody of a facility or person other than the secretary, the plan shall
27 be prepared and submitted by a court services officer. If the permanency
28 goal is reintegration into the family, the permanency plan shall include
29 measurable objectives and time schedules for reintegration.
30 (d) During the time a juvenile remains in the custody of the secretary,
31 the secretary shall submit to the court, at least every six months, a written
32 report of the progress being made toward the goals of the permanency plan
33 submitted pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and the specific actions taken
34 to achieve the goals of the permanency plan. If the juvenile is placed in
35 foster care, the court may request the foster parent to submit to the court,
36 at least every six months, a report in regard to the juvenile's adjustment,
37 progress and condition. Such report shall be made a part of the juvenile's
38 court social file. The court shall review the plan submitted by the secretary
39 and the report, if any, submitted by the foster parent and determine
40 whether reasonable efforts and progress have been made to achieve the
41 goals of the permanency plan. If the court determines that progress is
42 inadequate or that the permanency plan is no longer viable, the court shall
43 hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (e).

HB 2329—Am. by HC 11
1 (e) When the secretary has custody of the juvenile, a permanency
2 hearing shall be held no more than 12 months after the juvenile is first
3 placed outside such juvenile's home and at least every 12 months
4 thereafter. Juvenile offenders who have been in extended out-of-home
5 placement shall be provided a permanency hearing within 30 days of a
6 request from the secretary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
7 represent the juvenile offender at the permanency hearing. At the
8 permanency hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable,
9 when the juvenile will be:
10 (1) Reintegrated with the juvenile's parents;
11 (2) placed for adoption;
12 (3) placed with a permanent custodian; or
13 (4) if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and the secretary has
14 documented compelling reasons why it would not be in the juvenile's best
15 interests for a placement in one of the placements pursuant to paragraphs
16 (1), (2) or (3), placed in another planned permanent arrangement.
17 (f) At each permanency hearing, the court shall:
18 (1) Make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been
19 made to accomplish the permanency goal and whether continued out-of-
20 home placement is necessary for the juvenile's safety;
21 (2) make a written finding as to whether the reasonable and prudent
22 parenting standard has been met and whether the juvenile has regular,
23 ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
24 activities. The secretary shall report to the court the steps the secretary is
25 taking to ensure that the reasonable and prudent parenting standard is
26 being met and that the juvenile has regular, ongoing opportunities to
27 engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including
28 consultation with the juvenile in an age-appropriate manner about the
29 opportunities of the juvenile to participate in the activities; and
30 (3) if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, document the efforts
31 made by the secretary to help the juvenile prepare for the transition from
32 custody to a successful adulthood. The secretary shall report to the court
33 the programs and services that are being provided to the juvenile which
34 will help the juvenile prepare for the transition from custody to a
35 successful adulthood.
36 (g) The requirements of this subsection shall apply only if the
37 permanency goal in place at the time of the hearing is another planned
38 permanent arrangement as described in subsection (e)(4). At each
39 permanency hearing held with respect to the juvenile, in addition to the
40 requirements of subsection (f), the court shall:
41 (1) Ask the juvenile, if the juvenile is able, by attendance at the
42 hearing or by report to the court, about the desired permanency outcome
43 for the juvenile;

HB 2329—Am. by HC 12
1 (2) document the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
2 unsuccessful permanency efforts made by the secretary to return the
3 juvenile home or secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing
4 relative, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent. The secretary shall report
5 to the court the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
6 unsuccessful efforts made by the secretary to return the juvenile home or
7 secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing relative, a legal
8 guardian or an adoptive parent, including efforts that utilize search
9 technology, including social media, to find biological family members of
10 the children; and
11 (3) make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of
12 the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
13 permanency plan for the juvenile and provide compelling reasons why it
14 continues to not be in the best interests of the juvenile to return home, be
15 placed for adoption, be placed with a legal guardian or be placed with a fit
16 and willing relative.
17 (h) Whenever a hearing is required under subsection (e), the court
18 shall notify all interested parties of the hearing date, the secretary, foster
19 parent and preadoptive parent or relatives providing care for the juvenile
20 and hold a hearing. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, the court
21 shall require notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing be
22 given to the juvenile. Such notice shall request the juvenile's participation
23 in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. Individuals receiving
24 notice pursuant to this subsection shall not be made a party to the action
25 solely on the basis of this notice and opportunity to be heard. After
26 providing the persons receiving notice an opportunity to be heard, the
27 court shall determine whether the juvenile's needs are being adequately
28 met; whether services set out in the permanency plan necessary for the
29 safe return of the juvenile have been made available to the parent with
30 whom reintegration is planned; and whether reasonable efforts and
31 progress have been made to achieve the goals of the permanency plan.
32 (i) If the court finds reintegration continues to be a viable alternative,
33 the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the juvenile will
34 be returned to the parent. The court may rescind any of its prior
35 dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized by this
36 code or may order that a new plan for the reintegration be prepared and
37 submitted to the court. If reintegration cannot be accomplished as
38 approved by the court, the court shall be informed and shall schedule a
39 hearing pursuant to subsection (j). No such hearing is required when the
40 parent voluntarily relinquishes parental rights or agrees to appointment of
41 a permanent guardian.
42 (j) When the court finds any of the following conditions exist, the
43 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee shall

HB 2329—Am. by HC 13
1 file a petition alleging the juvenile to be a child in need of care and
2 requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to the Kansas code for
3 care of children:
4 (1) The court determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative
5 and either adoption or permanent guardianship might be in the best
6 interests of the juvenile;
7 (2) the goal of the permanency plan is reintegration into the family
8 and the court determines after 12 months from the time such plan is first
9 submitted that progress is inadequate; or
10 (3) the juvenile has been in out-of-home placement for a cumulative
11 total of 15 of the last 22 months, excluding trial home visits and juvenile in
12 runaway status.
13 Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit termination of
14 parental rights prior to the expiration of 12 months.
15 (k) A petition to terminate parental rights is not required to be filed if
16 one of the following exceptions is documented to exist:
17 (1) The juvenile is in a stable placement with relatives;
18 (2) services set out in the case plan necessary for the safe return of
19 the juvenile have not been made available to the parent with whom
20 reintegration is planned; or
21 (3) there are one or more documented reasons why such filing would
22 not be in the best interests of the juvenile. Documented reasons may
23 include, but are not limited to: The juvenile has close emotional bonds
24 with a parent which should not be broken; the juvenile is 14 years of age
25 or older and, after advice and counsel, refuses to be adopted; insufficient
26 grounds exist for termination of parental rights; the juvenile is an
27 unaccompanied refugee minor; or there are international legal or
28 compelling foreign policy reasons precluding termination of parental
29 rights.
30 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 38-2369 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
31 2369. (a) Except as provided in subsection (e) and K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13),
32 and amendments thereto, for the purpose of committing juvenile
33 offenders to a juvenile correctional facility, upon a finding by the judge
34 entered into the written order that the juvenile poses a significant risk of
35 harm to another or damage to property, the following placements shall be
36 applied by the judge in the cases specified in this subsection. If used, the
37 court shall establish a specific term of commitment as specified in this
38 subsection. The term of commitment established by the court shall not
39 exceed the overall case length limit. Before a juvenile offender is
40 committed to a juvenile correctional facility pursuant to this section, the
41 court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as described in K.S.A. 38-
42 2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk assessment tool that was
43 administered within the past six months to the juvenile.

36 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
37 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall

41 will be deemed a felony in Kansas. The state of Kansas shall classify the
42 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
43 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such

HB 2329—Am. by HC 16

10 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
11 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
12 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. The
13 secretary shall ensure timely placement of such offender in a youth
14 residential facility and shall be responsible for the costs associated with
15 all aspects of such placement in accordance with K.S.A. 38-2399, and
16 amendments thereto, This presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the
17 record that the juvenile offender poses a significant risk of physical harm
18 to another.
19 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2391 is hereby amended to read as
20 follows: 38-2391. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender
21 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and amendments thereto, modification of
22 sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367, and amendments thereto, or
23 violation of a condition of sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and

25 sentencing alternatives under K.S.A. 38-2361, and amendments
26 thereto, for a period of time pursuant to this section and K.S.A. 38-
27 2369, and amendments thereto. The period of time ordered by the
28 court shall not exceed the overall case length limit.
29 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the overall case length
30 limit shall be calculated based on the adjudicated offense and the
31 results of a risk and needs assessment, as follows:
32 (1) Offenders adjudicated for a misdemeanor may remain under
33 the jurisdiction of the court for up to 12 months;
34 (2) low-risk and moderate-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony
35 may remain under court jurisdiction for up to 15 months; and
36 (3) high-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may remain
37 under court jurisdiction for up to 18 months.
38 (c) There shall be no overall case length limit for a juvenile
39 adjudicated for a felony which, if committed by an adult, would
40 constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1 through 4
41 person felony.
42 (d) When a juvenile is adjudicated for multiple counts, the
43 maximum overall case length shall be calculated based on the most

HB 2329—Am. by HC 17
1 severe adjudicated count or any other adjudicated count at the court's
2 discretion. The court shall not run multiple adjudicated counts
3 consecutively.
4 (e) When the juvenile is adjudicated for multiple cases
5 simultaneously, the court shall run such cases concurrently.
6 (f) Upon expiration of the overall case length limit as defined in
7 subsection (b), the court's jurisdiction terminates and shall not be
8 extended, except as provided in subsection (g)(2).
9 (g) (1) For the purposes of placing juvenile offenders on
10 probation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361, and amendments thereto, the
11 court shall establish a specific term of probation as specified in this
12 subsection based on the most serious adjudicated count in
13 combination with the results of a risk and needs assessment, as
14 follows, except that the term of probation shall not exceed the overall
15 case length limit:
16 (A) Low-risk and moderate-risk offenders adjudicated for a
17 misdemeanor and low-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be
18 placed on probation for a term up to six months;

20 moderate-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be placed on
21 probation for a term up to nine months; and
22 (C) high-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be placed on
23 probation for a term up to 12 months.
24 (2) The court may extend the term of probation if a juvenile
25 needs time to complete an evidence-based program as determined to
26 be necessary based on the results of a validated risk and needs
27 assessment and, if necessary, may extend the overall case length limit
28 to allow for completion of such program when failure to complete such
29 program is due to a repeated, intentional effort to delay by the
30 juvenile as reported by the evidence-based services provider. The
31 court may also extend the term of probation for good cause shown for
32 one month for low-risk offenders, three months for moderate-risk
33 offenders and six months for high-risk offenders. Prior to extension of
34 the initial probationary term, the court shall find and enter into the
35 written record the criteria permitting extension of probation.
36 Extensions of probation and the overall case length limit shall only be
37 granted incrementally. When the court extends the term of probation
38 for a juvenile offender, the court services officer or community
39 correctional services officer responsible for monitoring such juvenile
40 offender shall record the reason given for extending probation. Court
41 services officers shall report such records to the office of judicial
42 administration, and community correctional services officers shall
43 report such records to the department of corrections. The office of

HB 2329—Am. by HC 18
1 judicial administration and the department of corrections shall report
2 such recorded data to the Kansas juvenile justice oversight committee
3 on a quarterly basis.
4 (3) The probation term limits do not apply to those offenders
5 adjudicated for an offense which, if committed by an adult, would
6 constitute an off-grid crime, rape as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503(a)(1),
7 and amendments thereto, aggravated criminal sodomy as defined in
8 K.S.A. 21-5504(b)(3), and amendments thereto, or murder in the
9 second degree as defined in K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto.
10 Such offenders may be placed on probation for a term consistent with
11 the overall case length limit.
12 (4) The probation term limits and overall case length limits
13 provided in this section shall be tolled during any time that the
14 offender has absconded from supervision while on probation, and the
15 time on such limits shall not start to run again until the offender is
16 located and brought back to the jurisdiction.
17 (h) For the purpose of placing juvenile offenders in detention
18 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361 and 38-2369, and amendments thereto, the
19 court shall establish a specific term of detention. The term of detention
20 shall not exceed the overall case length limit or the cumulative
21 detention limit. Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a
22 maximum of 45 90 days over the course of the juvenile offender's case,
23 except that there shall be no limit on cumulative detention for juvenile
24 offenders adjudicated for a felony which, if committed by an adult,
25 would constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1
26 through 4 person felony.
27 (i) The provisions of this section shall apply upon disposition or
28 15 days after adjudication, whichever is sooner, unless the juvenile
29 fails to appear for such juvenile's dispositional hearing. If a juvenile
30 fails to appear at such juvenile's dispositional hearing, the probation
31 term limits and overall case length limits provided in this section shall
32 not apply until the juvenile is brought before the court for disposition
33 in such juvenile's case.
34 (j) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
35 Kansas juvenile justice code.
36 Sec. 4. 5. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-

23 (3)(5) All expenditures from the evidence-based programs account of

28 (b) At least annually, throughout the year, the secretary of corrections
29 shall determine and certify to the director of accounts and reports the
30 amount in each account of the state general fund of a state agency that has
31 been determined by the secretary to be actual or projected cost savings as a
32 result of cost avoidance resulting from decreased reliance on incarceration

36 (c) Upon receipt of a certification pursuant to subsection (b), the

23 (g) The evidence-based programs account of the state general fund
24 and any other moneys transferred pursuant to this section shall be used for

32 assessment system and programs for children in need of care. Except
33 as provided further, the secretary of corrections shall promulgate
34 rules and regulations for the juvenile intake and assessment system
35 and programs concerning juvenile offenders. If the secretary contracts
36 with the office of judicial administration to administer the juvenile
37 intake and assessment system and programs concerning juvenile
38 offenders, the supreme court administrative orders shall be in force
39 until such contract ends and the rules and regulations concerning
40 juvenile intake and assessment system and programs concerning
41 juvenile offenders have been adopted.
42 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, records,
43 reports and information obtained as a part of the juvenile intake and

HB 2329—Am. by HC 25
1 assessment process shall not be admitted into evidence in any
2 proceeding and shall not be used in a child in need of care proceeding
3 or a juvenile offender proceeding.
4 (1) Such records, reports and information may be used in a child
5 in need of care proceeding for diagnostic and referral purposes and by
6 the court in considering dispositional alternatives. If the records,
7 reports or information are in regard to abuse or neglect, which is
8 required to be reported under K.S.A. 38-2223, and amendments
9 thereto, such records, reports or information may then be used for any
10 purpose in a child in need of care proceeding pursuant to the revised
11 Kansas code for care of children.
12 (2) Such records, reports and information may be used in a
13 juvenile offender proceeding only if such records, reports and
14 information are in regard to the possible trafficking of a runaway.
15 Such records, reports and information in regard to the possible
16 trafficking of a runaway shall be made available to the appropriate
17 county or district attorney and the court, and shall be used only for
18 diagnostic and referral purposes.
19 (c) Upon a juvenile being taken into custody pursuant to K.S.A.
20 38-2330, and amendments thereto, a juvenile intake and assessment
21 worker shall complete the intake and assessment process, making
22 release and referral determinations as required by supreme court
23 administrative order or district court rule, or except as provided
24 above [in] rules and regulations established by the secretary of
25 corrections.
26 (d) Except as provided in subsection (g) and in addition to any
27 other information required by the supreme court administrative
28 order, the secretary for children and families, the secretary of

30 and assessment worker shall collect the following information either in

5 such child, the intake and assessment worker shall make both a
6 release and a referral determination:
7 (1) Release the child to the custody of the child's parent, other
8 legal guardian or another appropriate adult.
9 (2) Conditionally release the child to the child's parent, other
10 legal guardian or another appropriate adult if the intake and
11 assessment worker believes that if the conditions are met, it would be
12 in the child's best interest to release the child to such child's parent,
13 other legal guardian or another appropriate adult; and the intake and
14 assessment worker has reason to believe that it might be harmful to
15 the child to release the child to such child's parents, other legal
16 guardian or another appropriate adult without imposing the
17 conditions. The conditions may include, but not be limited to the
18 alternatives listed in K.S.A. 38-2331(b), and amendments thereto, and
19 the following:
20 (A) Participation of the child in counseling;

35 future abuse or neglect.
36 (3) Deliver the child to a shelter facility or a licensed attendant
37 care center along with the law enforcement officer's written
38 application for a maximum stay of up to 72 hours. The shelter facility
39 or licensed attendant care facility shall then have custody as if the
40 child had been directly delivered to the facility by the law enforcement
41 officer pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2232, and amendments thereto.
42 (4) The intake and assessment worker shall also refer the
43 juvenile's case to one of the following:

1 (A) An immediate intervention program pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
2 2346(b), and amendments thereto;

6 to K.S.A. 38-2389, and amendments thereto, or immediate
7 intervention pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto; or
8 (C) refer the child and family to the secretary for children and
9 families for investigations in regard to the allegations.

18 establish cutoff scores determining eligibility for placement in a
19 juvenile detention facility or for referral to a community-based
20 alternative to detention and shall collect and report data regarding the
21 use of the detention risk assessment tool.
22 (3) (A) The detention risk assessment tool includes an override
23 function that may be approved by the court for use under certain
24 circumstances. If approved by the court, the juvenile intake and
25 assessment worker or the court may override the detention risk
26 assessment tool score in order to direct placement in a short-term
27 shelter facility, a community-based alternative to detention or, subject
28 to K.S.A. 38-2331, and amendments thereto, a juvenile detention
29 facility. Such override must be documented, include a written
30 explanation and receive approval from the director of the intake and
31 assessment center or the court.
32 (B) The court shall approve an override function of the detention risk
33 assessment tool for use when a juvenile is alleged to have possessed or
34 used a firearm during the commission of an offense. In such an instance,
35 the juvenile intake and assessment worker or the court shall place such
36 juvenile in a juvenile detention facility.
37 (4) If a juvenile meets one or more eligibility criteria for detention
38 or referral to a community-based alternative to detention, the person
39 with authority to detain shall maintain discretion to release the
40 juvenile if other less restrictive measures would be adequate.
41 (g) Parents, guardians and juveniles may access the juvenile
42 intake and assessment programs on a voluntary basis. The parent or
43 guardian shall be responsible for the costs of any such program

HB 2329—Am. by HC 28
1 utilized.

3 training in evidence-based practices, including, but not limited to:

6 (3) graduated responses;
7 (4) family engagement;
