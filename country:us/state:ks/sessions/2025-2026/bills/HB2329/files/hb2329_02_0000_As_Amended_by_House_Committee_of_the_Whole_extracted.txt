18 Section 1. K.S.A. 38-2361 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
19 2361. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
20 2356, and amendments thereto, modification of sentence pursuant to
21 K.S.A. 38-2367, and amendments thereto, or violation of a condition of
22 sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto, the court
23 may impose one or more of the following sentencing alternatives for a
24 fixed period pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments
25 thereto.
26 (1) Place the juvenile on probation for a fixed period pursuant to
27 K.S.A. 38-2391, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
28 the court deems appropriate consistent with juvenile justice programs in
29 the community. Any juvenile placed on probation shall be supervised
30 according to the juvenile's risk and needs as determined by a risk and
31 needs assessment. Placement of juvenile offenders to community
32 corrections for probation supervision shall be limited to offenders
33 adjudicated for an offense that are determined to be moderate-risk, high-
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 2
1 risk or very high-risk on a risk and needs assessment using the cutoff
2 scores established by the secretary pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2360, and
3 amendments thereto.
4 (2) Order the juvenile to participate in a community based program
5 available in such judicial district subject to the terms and conditions the
6 court deems appropriate. This alternative shall not be ordered with the
7 alternative in paragraph (11). Requirements pertaining to child support
8 may apply if custody is vested with other than a parent.
9 (3) Place the juvenile in the custody of a parent or other suitable
10 person, which is not a group home youth residential facility or other
11 facility licensed pursuant to article 5 of chapter 65 of the Kansas Statutes
12 Annotated, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
13 consistent with juvenile justice programs in the community. This
14 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (10) or
15 (11). Requirements pertaining to child support may apply if custody is
16 vested with other than a parent.
17 (4) Order the juvenile to attend counseling, educational, mediation or
18 other sessions, or to undergo a drug evaluation pursuant to subsection (b).
19 (5) Suspend or restrict the juvenile's driver's license or privilege to
20 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state pursuant
21 to subsection (c).
22 (6) Order the juvenile to perform charitable or community service
23 work.
24 (7) Order the juvenile to make appropriate reparation or restitution
25 pursuant to subsection (d).
26 (8) Order the juvenile to pay a fine not exceeding $1,000 pursuant to
27 subsection (e).
28 (9) Place the juvenile under a house arrest program administered by
29 the court pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto.
30 (10) Place the juvenile in the custody of the secretary of corrections
31 as provided in K.S.A. 38-2365, and amendments thereto, and order the
32 secretary to place the juvenile in a youth residential facility. This
33 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (3) or
34 (12). Except for mandatory drug and alcohol evaluation, when this
35 alternative is ordered with alternatives in paragraphs (2), (4) and (9), such
36 orders shall constitute a recommendation by the court. Requirements
37 pertaining to child support shall apply under this alternative. The
38 provisions of this paragraph shall expire on January 1, 2018.
39 (11) Upon a violation of a condition of sentence, other than a
40 technical violation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto,
41 commit the juvenile to detention for a period no longer than 30 days
42 subject to the provisions of subsection (g).
43 (12) If the judge finds and enters into the written record that the
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 3
1 juvenile poses a significant risk of harm to another or damage to property,
2 and the juvenile is otherwise eligible for commitment pursuant to K.S.A.
3 38-2369, and amendments thereto, commit the juvenile directly to the
4 custody of the secretary of corrections for placement in a juvenile
5 correctional facility or a youth residential facility. Placement in a youth
6 residential facility shall only be permitted as authorized in K.S.A. 38-
7 2369(e), and amendments thereto. If the court elects, a period of
8 conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
9 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
10 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
11 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
12 facility, the secretary of corrections or designee shall notify the court of the
13 juvenile's anticipated release date. This alternative may be ordered with the
14 alternative in paragraph (7). Requirements pertaining to child support shall
15 apply under this alternative.
16 (13) Upon a finding by the trier of fact during adjudication that a
17 firearm was possessed or used in during the commission of an offense by
18 the accused which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, a
19 judge may commit the juvenile directly to the custody of the secretary of
20 corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility or youth
21 residential facility for a minimum term of six 12 months and up to a
22 maximum term of 18 24 months, regardless of the risk level of such
23 juvenile as determined by a risk and needs assessment. If the juvenile is
24 committed to the custody of the secretary, and the court elects, a period of
25 conditional release, pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
26 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
27 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
28 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
29 facility or youth residential facility, the secretary of corrections or the
30 secretary's designee shall notify the court of the juvenile's anticipated
31 release date.
32 (b) If the court orders the juvenile to attend counseling, educational,
33 mediation or other sessions, or to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation
34 pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the following provisions apply:
35 (1) The court may order the juvenile offender to participate in
36 counseling or mediation sessions or a program of education, including
37 placement in an alternative educational program approved by a local
38 school board. The costs of any counseling or mediation may be assessed as
39 expenses in the case. No mental health center shall charge a fee for court-
40 ordered counseling greater than what the center would have charged the
41 person receiving the counseling if the person had requested counseling on
42 the person's own initiative. No mediator shall charge a fee for court-
43 ordered mediation greater than what the mediator would have charged the
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 4
1 person participating in the mediation if the person had requested mediation
2 on the person's own initiative. Mediation may include the victim but shall
3 not be mandatory for the victim; and
4 (2) if the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile by reason of a
5 violation of a statute that makes such a requirement, the court shall order
6 and, if adjudicated for any other offense, the court may order the juvenile
7 to submit to and complete a drug and alcohol evaluation by a community-
8 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
9 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
10 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
11 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
12 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
13 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
14 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
15 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
16 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
17 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
18 the fee. In no event shall the fee be assessed against the secretary of
19 corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be assessed
20 against the secretary of the department for children and families or the
21 Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
22 secretary's care, custody and control.
23 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
24 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
25 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
26 provisions apply:
27 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
28 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
29 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
30 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
31 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
32 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
33 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
34 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
35 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
36 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
37 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
38 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
39 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
40 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
41 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
42 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
43 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 5
1 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
2 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
3 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
4 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
5 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
6 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
7 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
8 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
9 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
10 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
11 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
12 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
13 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
14 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
15 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
16 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
17 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
18 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
19 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
20 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
21 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
22 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
23 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
24 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
25 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
26 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
27 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
28 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
29 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
30 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
31 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
32 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
33 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
34 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
35 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
36 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
37 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
38 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
39 conditions.
40 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
41 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
42 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
43 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 6
1 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
2 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
3 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
4 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
5 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
6 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
7 organizations performing services for the community; and
8 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
9 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
10 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
11 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
12 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
13 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
14 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
15 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
16 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
17 following provisions apply:
18 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
19 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
20 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
21 lump sum or installments;
22 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
23 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
24 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
25 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
26 imposition of a fine; and
27 (3) any fine imposed by the court shall be a judgment against the
28 juvenile that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other
29 execution as on judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be
30 affected by the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
31 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
32 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
33 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
34 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
35 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
36 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
37 (g) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
38 subsection (a)(11), the following provisions shall apply:
39 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
40 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
41 exhausted.
42 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
43 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 7
1 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
2 new felony offense, or violates conditional release.
3 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
4 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
5 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
6 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
7 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
8 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
9 {90} days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A.
10 38-2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
11 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
12 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
13 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 {90}
14 days or the overall case length limit.
15 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
16 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
17 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
18 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
19 facility.
20 (h) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be in
21 effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
22 (i) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
23 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
24 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
25 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
26 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
27 within 30 days of final disposition.
28 (j) (1) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to
29 be a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult
30 would constitute the commission of: (1) (A) Aggravated human
31 trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if
32 the victim is less than 14 years of age; (2) (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A.
33 21-5503(a)(3), and amendments thereto; (3) (C) aggravated indecent
34 liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5506(b)(3), and amendments
35 thereto; (4) (D) aggravated criminal sodomy, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
36 5504(b)(1) or (b)(2), and amendments thereto; (5) (E) commercial sexual
37 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments
38 thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; (6) (F) sexual
39 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and
40 amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; or (7) (G)
41 an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
42 5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an offense defined
43 in paragraphs (1) through (6); subparagraphs (A) through (F).
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 8
1 (2) The court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from
2 attending the attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If
3 only one attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are
4 eligible to attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile
5 reside, the court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim,
6 the juvenile, their families and a representative of the school district as to
7 why the juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the
8 attendance center attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may
9 issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center
10 that the victim of the offense attends.
11 (k) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
12 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
13 foster home or community integration program if:
14 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
15 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
16 commission of:
17 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
18 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;
19 (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503, and amendments thereto;
20 (C) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A.
21 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
22 age;
23 (D) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1)
24 or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
25 age;
26 (E) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A.
27 21-5506, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
28 age; or
29 (F) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in
30 K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an
31 offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (4) subparagraphs (A) through
32 (E); and
33 (2) (A) the victim resides in the same home as the juvenile offender;
34 (B) a community supervision officer in consultation with the
35 department for children and families determines that an adequate safety
36 plan, which shall include the physical and psychological well-being of the
37 victim, cannot be developed to keep the juvenile in the same home; and
38 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
39 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
40 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
41 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
42 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
43 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 9
1 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
2 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
3 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
4 initial order of the court.
5 (l) If the court orders a short-term alternative placement of a juvenile
6 pursuant to subsection (k), the secretary shall be responsible for the costs
7 associated with all aspects of such placement. The secretary shall contract
8 with emergency shelters and therapeutic foster homes in order to facilitate
9 the placement of juvenile offenders pursuant to subsection (k).
10 (m) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided in
11 K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.
12 (m)(n) The overall case length limit shall be calculated by the court
13 and entered into the written record when one or more of the sentencing
14 options under this section are imposed. The period fixed by the court
15 pursuant to subsection (a) shall not extend beyond the overall case length
16 limit.
17 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 38-2365 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
18 2365. (a) When a juvenile offender has been placed in the custody of the
19 secretary, the secretary shall have a reasonable time to make a placement.
20 If the juvenile offender has not been placed, any party who believes that
21 the amount of time elapsed without placement has exceeded a reasonable
22 time may file a motion for review with the court. In determining what is a
23 reasonable amount of time, matters considered by the court shall include,
24 but not be limited to, the nature of the underlying offense, efforts made for
25 placement of the juvenile offender and the availability of a suitable
26 placement. The secretary shall notify the court, the juvenile's attorney of
27 record and the juvenile's parent, in writing, of the initial placement and any
28 subsequent change of placement as soon as the placement has been
29 accomplished. The notice to the juvenile offender's parent shall be sent to
30 such parent's last known address or addresses. Except as provided in
31 K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the court shall have no power to direct a specific
32 placement by the secretary, but may make recommendations to the
33 secretary. Except as provided in K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the secretary may
34 place the juvenile offender in an institution operated by the secretary, a
35 youth residential facility or any other appropriate placement. If the court
36 has recommended an out-of-home placement, the secretary may not return
37 the juvenile offender to the home from which removed without first
38 notifying the court of the plan.
39 (b) If a juvenile is in the custody of the secretary, the secretary shall
40 prepare and present a permanency plan at sentencing or within 30 days
41 thereafter. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older and the juvenile is
42 able, the secretary shall prepare the permanency plan in consultation with
43 the juvenile. If a permanency plan is already in place under a child in need
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 10
1 of care proceeding, the court may adopt the plan under the present
2 proceeding. The written permanency plan shall provide for reintegration of
3 the juvenile into such juvenile's family or, if reintegration is not a viable
4 alternative, for other permanent placement of the juvenile. Reintegration
5 may not be a viable alternative when: (1) The parent has been found by a
6 court to have committed murder in the first degree, K.S.A. 21-3401, prior
7 to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments thereto, murder in the
8 second degree, K.S.A. 21-3402, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5403, and
9 amendments thereto, capital murder, K.S.A. 21-3439, prior to its repeal, or
10 K.S.A. 21-5401, and amendments thereto, voluntary manslaughter, K.S.A.
11 21-3403, prior to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5404, and amendments thereto,
12 of a child or violated a law of another state which prohibits such murder or
13 manslaughter of a child;
14 (2) the parent aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to
15 commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter of a child;
16 (3) the parent committed a felony battery that resulted in bodily
17 injury to the juvenile who is the subject of this proceeding or another
18 child;
19 (4) the parent has subjected the juvenile who is the subject of this
20 proceeding or another child to aggravated circumstances as defined in
21 K.S.A. 38-1502, and amendments thereto;
22 (5) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been
23 terminated involuntarily; or
24 (6) the juvenile has been in extended out-of-home placement as
25 defined in K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto.
26 (c) If the juvenile is placed in the custody of the secretary, the plan
27 shall be prepared and submitted by the secretary. If the juvenile is placed
28 in the custody of a facility or person other than the secretary, the plan shall
29 be prepared and submitted by a court services officer. If the permanency
30 goal is reintegration into the family, the permanency plan shall include
31 measurable objectives and time schedules for reintegration.
32 (d) During the time a juvenile remains in the custody of the secretary,
33 the secretary shall submit to the court, at least every six months, a written
34 report of the progress being made toward the goals of the permanency plan
35 submitted pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and the specific actions taken
36 to achieve the goals of the permanency plan. If the juvenile is placed in
37 foster care, the court may request the foster parent to submit to the court,
38 at least every six months, a report in regard to the juvenile's adjustment,
39 progress and condition. Such report shall be made a part of the juvenile's
40 court social file. The court shall review the plan submitted by the secretary
41 and the report, if any, submitted by the foster parent and determine
42 whether reasonable efforts and progress have been made to achieve the
43 goals of the permanency plan. If the court determines that progress is
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 11
1 inadequate or that the permanency plan is no longer viable, the court shall
2 hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (e).
3 (e) When the secretary has custody of the juvenile, a permanency
4 hearing shall be held no more than 12 months after the juvenile is first
5 placed outside such juvenile's home and at least every 12 months
6 thereafter. Juvenile offenders who have been in extended out-of-home
7 placement shall be provided a permanency hearing within 30 days of a
8 request from the secretary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
9 represent the juvenile offender at the permanency hearing. At the
10 permanency hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable,
11 when the juvenile will be:
12 (1) Reintegrated with the juvenile's parents;
13 (2) placed for adoption;
14 (3) placed with a permanent custodian; or
15 (4) if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and the secretary has
16 documented compelling reasons why it would not be in the juvenile's best
17 interests for a placement in one of the placements pursuant to paragraphs
18 (1), (2) or (3), placed in another planned permanent arrangement.
19 (f) At each permanency hearing, the court shall:
20 (1) Make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been
21 made to accomplish the permanency goal and whether continued out-of-
22 home placement is necessary for the juvenile's safety;
23 (2) make a written finding as to whether the reasonable and prudent
24 parenting standard has been met and whether the juvenile has regular,
25 ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
26 activities. The secretary shall report to the court the steps the secretary is
27 taking to ensure that the reasonable and prudent parenting standard is
28 being met and that the juvenile has regular, ongoing opportunities to
29 engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including
30 consultation with the juvenile in an age-appropriate manner about the
31 opportunities of the juvenile to participate in the activities; and
32 (3) if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, document the efforts
33 made by the secretary to help the juvenile prepare for the transition from
34 custody to a successful adulthood. The secretary shall report to the court
35 the programs and services that are being provided to the juvenile which
36 will help the juvenile prepare for the transition from custody to a
37 successful adulthood.
38 (g) The requirements of this subsection shall apply only if the
39 permanency goal in place at the time of the hearing is another planned
40 permanent arrangement as described in subsection (e)(4). At each
41 permanency hearing held with respect to the juvenile, in addition to the
42 requirements of subsection (f), the court shall:
43 (1) Ask the juvenile, if the juvenile is able, by attendance at the
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 12
1 hearing or by report to the court, about the desired permanency outcome
2 for the juvenile;
3 (2) document the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
4 unsuccessful permanency efforts made by the secretary to return the
5 juvenile home or secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing
6 relative, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent. The secretary shall report
7 to the court the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
8 unsuccessful efforts made by the secretary to return the juvenile home or
9 secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing relative, a legal
10 guardian or an adoptive parent, including efforts that utilize search
11 technology, including social media, to find biological family members of
12 the children; and
13 (3) make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of
14 the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
15 permanency plan for the juvenile and provide compelling reasons why it
16 continues to not be in the best interests of the juvenile to return home, be
17 placed for adoption, be placed with a legal guardian or be placed with a fit
18 and willing relative.
19 (h) Whenever a hearing is required under subsection (e), the court
20 shall notify all interested parties of the hearing date, the secretary, foster
21 parent and preadoptive parent or relatives providing care for the juvenile
22 and hold a hearing. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, the court
23 shall require notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing be
24 given to the juvenile. Such notice shall request the juvenile's participation
25 in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. Individuals receiving
26 notice pursuant to this subsection shall not be made a party to the action
27 solely on the basis of this notice and opportunity to be heard. After
28 providing the persons receiving notice an opportunity to be heard, the
29 court shall determine whether the juvenile's needs are being adequately
30 met; whether services set out in the permanency plan necessary for the
31 safe return of the juvenile have been made available to the parent with
32 whom reintegration is planned; and whether reasonable efforts and
33 progress have been made to achieve the goals of the permanency plan.
34 (i) If the court finds reintegration continues to be a viable alternative,
35 the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the juvenile will
36 be returned to the parent. The court may rescind any of its prior
37 dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized by this
38 code or may order that a new plan for the reintegration be prepared and
39 submitted to the court. If reintegration cannot be accomplished as
40 approved by the court, the court shall be informed and shall schedule a
41 hearing pursuant to subsection (j). No such hearing is required when the
42 parent voluntarily relinquishes parental rights or agrees to appointment of
43 a permanent guardian.
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 13
1 (j) When the court finds any of the following conditions exist, the
2 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee shall
3 file a petition alleging the juvenile to be a child in need of care and
4 requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to the Kansas code for
5 care of children:
6 (1) The court determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative
7 and either adoption or permanent guardianship might be in the best
8 interests of the juvenile;
9 (2) the goal of the permanency plan is reintegration into the family
10 and the court determines after 12 months from the time such plan is first
11 submitted that progress is inadequate; or
12 (3) the juvenile has been in out-of-home placement for a cumulative
13 total of 15 of the last 22 months, excluding trial home visits and juvenile in
14 runaway status.
15 Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit termination of
16 parental rights prior to the expiration of 12 months.
17 (k) A petition to terminate parental rights is not required to be filed if
18 one of the following exceptions is documented to exist:
19 (1) The juvenile is in a stable placement with relatives;
20 (2) services set out in the case plan necessary for the safe return of
21 the juvenile have not been made available to the parent with whom
22 reintegration is planned; or
23 (3) there are one or more documented reasons why such filing would
24 not be in the best interests of the juvenile. Documented reasons may
25 include, but are not limited to: The juvenile has close emotional bonds
26 with a parent which should not be broken; the juvenile is 14 years of age
27 or older and, after advice and counsel, refuses to be adopted; insufficient
28 grounds exist for termination of parental rights; the juvenile is an
29 unaccompanied refugee minor; or there are international legal or
30 compelling foreign policy reasons precluding termination of parental
31 rights.

38 applied by the judge in the cases specified in this subsection. If used, the
39 court shall establish a specific term of commitment as specified in this

42 committed to a juvenile correctional facility if such offenders are assessed
43 as high-risk on a risk and needs assessment. Offenders in this category
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 15

38 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
39 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 16
1 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
2 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such

11 chronic offender category and offenders at least 10 years of age but less
12 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
13 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
14 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. The
15 secretary shall ensure timely placement of such offender in a youth
16 residential facility and shall be responsible for the costs associated with
17 all aspects of such placement in accordance with K.S.A. 38-2399, and
18 amendments thereto, This presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the
19 record that the juvenile offender poses a significant risk of physical harm
20 to another.
21 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2391 is hereby amended to read as

30 court shall not exceed the overall case length limit.
31 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the overall case length

41 adjudicated for a felony which, if committed by an adult, would
42 constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1 through 4
43 person felony.
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 17
1 (d) When a juvenile is adjudicated for multiple counts, the
2 maximum overall case length shall be calculated based on the most
3 severe adjudicated count or any other adjudicated count at the court's

5 consecutively.
6 (e) When the juvenile is adjudicated for multiple cases
7 simultaneously, the court shall run such cases concurrently.

12 probation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361, and amendments thereto, the
13 court shall establish a specific term of probation as specified in this

24 (C) high-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be placed on
25 probation for a term up to 12 months.
26 (2) The court may extend the term of probation if a juvenile
27 needs time to complete an evidence-based program as determined to
28 be necessary based on the results of a validated risk and needs
29 assessment and, if necessary, may extend the overall case length limit
30 to allow for completion of such program when failure to complete such
31 program is due to a repeated, intentional effort to delay by the
32 juvenile as reported by the evidence-based services provider. The
33 court may also extend the term of probation for good cause shown for
34 one month for low-risk offenders, three months for moderate-risk
35 offenders and six months for high-risk offenders. Prior to extension of
36 the initial probationary term, the court shall find and enter into the
37 written record the criteria permitting extension of probation.
38 Extensions of probation and the overall case length limit shall only be
39 granted incrementally. When the court extends the term of probation
40 for a juvenile offender, the court services officer or community
41 correctional services officer responsible for monitoring such juvenile
42 offender shall record the reason given for extending probation. Court
43 services officers shall report such records to the office of judicial
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 18
1 administration, and community correctional services officers shall
2 report such records to the department of corrections. The office of
3 judicial administration and the department of corrections shall report
4 such recorded data to the Kansas juvenile justice oversight committee
5 on a quarterly basis.
6 (3) The probation term limits do not apply to those offenders

9 and amendments thereto, aggravated criminal sodomy as defined in
10 K.S.A. 21-5504(b)(3), and amendments thereto, or murder in the
11 second degree as defined in K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto.
12 Such offenders may be placed on probation for a term consistent with
13 the overall case length limit.
14 (4) The probation term limits and overall case length limits
15 provided in this section shall be tolled during any time that the
16 offender has absconded from supervision while on probation, and the
17 time on such limits shall not start to run again until the offender is
18 located and brought back to the jurisdiction.
19 (h) For the purpose of placing juvenile offenders in detention
20 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361 and 38-2369, and amendments thereto, the
21 court shall establish a specific term of detention. The term of detention
22 shall not exceed the overall case length limit or the cumulative
23 detention limit. Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a
24 maximum of 45 90 days over the course of the juvenile offender's case,
25 except that there shall be no limit on cumulative detention for juvenile

30 15 days after adjudication, whichever is sooner, unless the juvenile
31 fails to appear for such juvenile's dispositional hearing. If a juvenile

34 not apply until the juvenile is brought before the court for disposition
35 in such juvenile's case.
36 (j) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
37 Kansas juvenile justice code.

30 (b) At least annually, throughout the year, the secretary of corrections
31 shall determine and certify to the director of accounts and reports the
32 amount in each account of the state general fund of a state agency that has
33 been determined by the secretary to be actual or projected cost savings as a

5 or a juvenile offender proceeding.
6 (1) Such records, reports and information may be used in a child

8 the court in considering dispositional alternatives. If the records,
9 reports or information are in regard to abuse or neglect, which is
10 required to be reported under K.S.A. 38-2223, and amendments
11 thereto, such records, reports or information may then be used for any
12 purpose in a child in need of care proceeding pursuant to the revised
13 Kansas code for care of children.
14 (2) Such records, reports and information may be used in a
15 juvenile offender proceeding only if such records, reports and
16 information are in regard to the possible trafficking of a runaway.
17 Such records, reports and information in regard to the possible
18 trafficking of a runaway shall be made available to the appropriate
19 county or district attorney and the court, and shall be used only for
20 diagnostic and referral purposes.
21 (c) Upon a juvenile being taken into custody pursuant to K.S.A.
22 38-2330, and amendments thereto, a juvenile intake and assessment
23 worker shall complete the intake and assessment process, making
24 release and referral determinations as required by supreme court
25 administrative order or district court rule, or except as provided
26 above [in] rules and regulations established by the secretary of
27 corrections.
28 (d) Except as provided in subsection (g) and in addition to any
29 other information required by the supreme court administrative
30 order, the secretary for children and families, the secretary of
31 corrections or by the district court of such district, the juvenile intake
32 and assessment worker shall collect the following information either in
33 person or over two-way audio or audio-visual communication:
34 (1) The results of a standardized detention risk assessment tool

7 such child, the intake and assessment worker shall make both a
8 release and a referral determination:
9 (1) Release the child to the custody of the child's parent, other
10 legal guardian or another appropriate adult.
11 (2) Conditionally release the child to the child's parent, other
12 legal guardian or another appropriate adult if the intake and
13 assessment worker believes that if the conditions are met, it would be
14 in the child's best interest to release the child to such child's parent,
15 other legal guardian or another appropriate adult; and the intake and
16 assessment worker has reason to believe that it might be harmful to
17 the child to release the child to such child's parents, other legal
18 guardian or another appropriate adult without imposing the
19 conditions. The conditions may include, but not be limited to the
20 alternatives listed in K.S.A. 38-2331(b), and amendments thereto, and
21 the following:
22 (A) Participation of the child in counseling;

39 care center along with the law enforcement officer's written
40 application for a maximum stay of up to 72 hours. The shelter facility
41 or licensed attendant care facility shall then have custody as if the
42 child had been directly delivered to the facility by the law enforcement
43 officer pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2232, and amendments thereto.
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 27
1 (4) The intake and assessment worker shall also refer the
2 juvenile's case to one of the following:
3 (A) An immediate intervention program pursuant to K.S.A. 38-

5 (B) the county or district attorney for appropriate proceedings to
6 be filed, with or without a recommendation that the juvenile be
7 considered for alternative means of adjudication programs pursuant
8 to K.S.A. 38-2389, and amendments thereto, or immediate
9 intervention pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2346, and amendments thereto; or
10 (C) refer the child and family to the secretary for children and
11 families for investigations in regard to the allegations.

23 use of the detention risk assessment tool.
24 (3) (A) The detention risk assessment tool includes an override
25 function that may be approved by the court for use under certain
26 circumstances. If approved by the court, the juvenile intake and
27 assessment worker or the court may override the detention risk
28 assessment tool score in order to direct placement in a short-term
29 shelter facility, a community-based alternative to detention or, subject
30 to K.S.A. 38-2331, and amendments thereto, a juvenile detention
31 facility. Such override must be documented, include a written
32 explanation and receive approval from the director of the intake and
33 assessment center or the court.
34 (B) The court shall approve an override function of the detention risk
35 assessment tool for use when a juvenile is alleged to have possessed or
36 used a firearm during the commission of an offense. In such an instance,

38 juvenile in a juvenile detention facility.
39 (4) If a juvenile meets one or more eligibility criteria for detention
40 or referral to a community-based alternative to detention, the person
41 with authority to detain shall maintain discretion to release the
42 juvenile if other less restrictive measures would be adequate.
43 (g) Parents, guardians and juveniles may access the juvenile
HB 2329—Am. by HCW 28
1 intake and assessment programs on a voluntary basis. The parent or
2 guardian shall be responsible for the costs of any such program
3 utilized.

5 training in evidence-based practices, including, but not limited to:
6 (1) Risk and needs assessments;
7 (2) individualized diversions based on needs and strengths;

16
17 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
18 Section 1. K.S.A. 38-2361 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
19 2361. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
20 2356, and amendments thereto, modification of sentence pursuant to
21 K.S.A. 38-2367, and amendments thereto, or violation of a condition of
22 sentence pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto, the court
23 may impose one or more of the following sentencing alternatives for a
24 fixed period pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments
25 thereto.
26 (1) Place the juvenile on probation for a fixed period pursuant to
27 K.S.A. 38-2391, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
28 the court deems appropriate consistent with juvenile justice programs in
29 the community. Any juvenile placed on probation shall be supervised
30 according to the juvenile's risk and needs as determined by a risk and
31 needs assessment. Placement of juvenile offenders to community
32 corrections for probation supervision shall be limited to offenders
33 adjudicated for an offense that are determined to be moderate-risk, high-

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 2
1 risk or very high-risk on a risk and needs assessment using the cutoff
2 scores established by the secretary pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2360, and
3 amendments thereto.
4 (2) Order the juvenile to participate in a community based program
5 available in such judicial district subject to the terms and conditions the
6 court deems appropriate. This alternative shall not be ordered with the
7 alternative in paragraph (11). Requirements pertaining to child support
8 may apply if custody is vested with other than a parent.
9 (3) Place the juvenile in the custody of a parent or other suitable
10 person, which is not a group home youth residential facility or other
11 facility licensed pursuant to article 5 of chapter 65 of the Kansas Statutes
12 Annotated, and amendments thereto, subject to terms and conditions
13 consistent with juvenile justice programs in the community. This
14 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (10) or
15 (11). Requirements pertaining to child support may apply if custody is
16 vested with other than a parent.
17 (4) Order the juvenile to attend counseling, educational, mediation or
18 other sessions, or to undergo a drug evaluation pursuant to subsection (b).
19 (5) Suspend or restrict the juvenile's driver's license or privilege to
20 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state pursuant
21 to subsection (c).
22 (6) Order the juvenile to perform charitable or community service
23 work.
24 (7) Order the juvenile to make appropriate reparation or restitution
25 pursuant to subsection (d).
26 (8) Order the juvenile to pay a fine not exceeding $1,000 pursuant to
27 subsection (e).
28 (9) Place the juvenile under a house arrest program administered by
29 the court pursuant to K.S.A. 21-6609, and amendments thereto.
30 (10) Place the juvenile in the custody of the secretary of corrections
31 as provided in K.S.A. 38-2365, and amendments thereto, and order the
32 secretary to place the juvenile in a youth residential facility. This
33 alternative shall not be ordered with the alternative in paragraph (3) or
34 (12). Except for mandatory drug and alcohol evaluation, when this
35 alternative is ordered with alternatives in paragraphs (2), (4) and (9), such
36 orders shall constitute a recommendation by the court. Requirements
37 pertaining to child support shall apply under this alternative. The
38 provisions of this paragraph shall expire on January 1, 2018.
39 (11) Upon a violation of a condition of sentence, other than a
40 technical violation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2368, and amendments thereto,
41 commit the juvenile to detention for a period no longer than 30 days
42 subject to the provisions of subsection (g).
43 (12) If the judge finds and enters into the written record that the

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 3
1 juvenile poses a significant risk of harm to another or damage to property,
2 and the juvenile is otherwise eligible for commitment pursuant to K.S.A.
3 38-2369, and amendments thereto, commit the juvenile directly to the
4 custody of the secretary of corrections for placement in a juvenile
5 correctional facility or a youth residential facility. Placement in a youth
6 residential facility shall only be permitted as authorized in K.S.A. 38-
7 2369(e), and amendments thereto. If the court elects, a period of
8 conditional release pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
9 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
10 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
11 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
12 facility, the secretary of corrections or designee shall notify the court of the
13 juvenile's anticipated release date. This alternative may be ordered with the
14 alternative in paragraph (7). Requirements pertaining to child support shall
15 apply under this alternative.
16 (13) Upon a finding by the trier of fact during adjudication that a
17 firearm was possessed or used in during the commission of an offense by
18 the accused which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, a
19 judge may commit the juvenile directly to the custody of the secretary of
20 corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility or youth
21 residential facility for a minimum term of six 12 months and up to a
22 maximum term of 18 24 months, regardless of the risk level of such
23 juvenile as determined by a risk and needs assessment. If the juvenile is
24 committed to the custody of the secretary, and the court elects, a period of
25 conditional release, pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369, and amendments thereto,
26 may also be ordered. The period of conditional release shall be limited to a
27 maximum of six months and shall be subject to graduated responses.
28 Twenty-one days prior to the juvenile's release from a juvenile correctional
29 facility or youth residential facility, the secretary of corrections or the
30 secretary's designee shall notify the court of the juvenile's anticipated
31 release date.
32 (b) If the court orders the juvenile to attend counseling, educational,
33 mediation or other sessions, or to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation
34 pursuant to subsection (a)(4), the following provisions apply:
35 (1) The court may order the juvenile offender to participate in
36 counseling or mediation sessions or a program of education, including
37 placement in an alternative educational program approved by a local
38 school board. The costs of any counseling or mediation may be assessed as
39 expenses in the case. No mental health center shall charge a fee for court-
40 ordered counseling greater than what the center would have charged the
41 person receiving the counseling if the person had requested counseling on
42 the person's own initiative. No mediator shall charge a fee for court-
43 ordered mediation greater than what the mediator would have charged the

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 4
1 person participating in the mediation if the person had requested mediation
2 on the person's own initiative. Mediation may include the victim but shall
3 not be mandatory for the victim; and
4 (2) if the juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile by reason of a
5 violation of a statute that makes such a requirement, the court shall order
6 and, if adjudicated for any other offense, the court may order the juvenile
7 to submit to and complete a drug and alcohol evaluation by a community-
8 based drug and alcohol safety action program certified pursuant to K.S.A.
9 8-1008, and amendments thereto, and to pay a fee not to exceed the fee
10 established by that statute for such evaluation. The court may waive the
11 mandatory evaluation if the court finds that the juvenile completed a drug
12 and alcohol evaluation, approved by the community-based alcohol and
13 drug safety action program, within 12 months before sentencing. If the
14 evaluation occurred more than 12 months before sentencing, the court
15 shall order the juvenile to resubmit to and complete the evaluation and
16 program as provided herein. If the court finds that the juvenile and those
17 legally liable for the juvenile's support are indigent, the court may waive
18 the fee. In no event shall the fee be assessed against the secretary of
19 corrections or the department of corrections nor shall the fee be assessed
20 against the secretary of the department for children and families or the
21 Kansas department for children and families if the juvenile is in the
22 secretary's care, custody and control.
23 (c) If the court orders suspension or restriction of a juvenile offender's
24 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
25 highways of this state pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the following
26 provisions apply:
27 (1) The duration of the suspension ordered by the court shall be for a
28 definite time period to be determined by the court. Upon suspension of a
29 license pursuant to this subsection, the court shall require the juvenile
30 offender to surrender the license to the court. The court shall transmit the
31 license to the division of motor vehicles of the department of revenue, to
32 be retained until the period of suspension expires. At that time, the licensee
33 may apply to the division for return of the license. If the license has
34 expired, the juvenile offender may apply for a new license, which shall be
35 issued promptly upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of other
36 conditions established by law for obtaining a license unless another
37 suspension or revocation of the juvenile offender's privilege to operate a
38 motor vehicle is in effect. As used in this subsection, "highway" and
39 "street" have the meanings provided by mean the same as defined in
40 K.S.A. 8-1424 and 8-1473, and amendments thereto. Any juvenile
41 offender who does not have a driver's license may have driving privileges
42 revoked. No Kansas driver's license shall be issued to a juvenile offender
43 whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant to this section for a

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 5
1 definite time period to be determined by the court; and
2 (2) in lieu of suspending a juvenile offender's driver's license or
3 privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state, the court
4 may enter an order which places conditions on the juvenile offender's
5 privilege of operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this
6 state, a certified copy of which the juvenile offender shall be required to
7 carry any time the juvenile offender is operating a motor vehicle on the
8 streets and highways of this state. The order shall prescribe a definite time
9 period for the conditions imposed. Upon entering an order restricting a
10 juvenile offender's license, the court shall require the juvenile offender to
11 surrender such juvenile offender's license to the court. The court shall
12 transmit the license to the division of vehicles, together with a copy of the
13 order. Upon receipt thereof, the division of vehicles shall issue without
14 charge a driver's license which shall indicate on its face that conditions
15 have been imposed on the juvenile offender's privilege of operating a
16 motor vehicle and that a certified copy of the order imposing the
17 conditions is required to be carried by the juvenile offender when
18 operating a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state. If the
19 juvenile offender is a nonresident, the court shall cause a copy of the order
20 to be transmitted to the division and the division shall forward a copy of it
21 to the motor vehicle administrator of the juvenile offender's state of
22 issuance. The court shall furnish to any juvenile offender whose driver's
23 license has had conditions imposed on it under this section a copy of the
24 order, which shall be recognized as a valid Kansas driver's license until the
25 division issues the restricted license provided for in this subsection. Upon
26 expiration of the period of time for which conditions are imposed pursuant
27 to this subsection, the juvenile offender may apply to the division for the
28 return of the license previously surrendered by the juvenile offender. In the
29 event the license has expired, the juvenile offender may apply to the
30 division for a new license, which shall be issued immediately by the
31 division upon payment of the proper fee and satisfaction of the other
32 conditions established by law unless such juvenile offender's privilege to
33 operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of this state has been
34 suspended or revoked prior thereto. If any juvenile offender violates any of
35 the conditions imposed under this subsection, the juvenile offender's
36 driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and
37 highways of this state shall be revoked for a period as determined by the
38 court in which the juvenile offender is convicted of violating such
39 conditions.
40 (d) The following provisions apply to the court's determination of
41 whether to order reparation or restitution pursuant to subsection (a)(7):
42 (1) The court shall order the juvenile to make reparation or restitution
43 to the aggrieved party for the damage or loss caused by the juvenile

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 6
1 offender's offense unless it finds compelling circumstances that would
2 render a plan of reparation or restitution unworkable. If the court finds
3 compelling circumstances that would render a plan of reparation or
4 restitution unworkable, the court shall enter such findings with
5 particularity on the record. In lieu of reparation or restitution, the court
6 may order the juvenile to perform charitable or social service for
7 organizations performing services for the community; and
8 (2) restitution may include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of
9 damage or loss caused by the juvenile's offense. Restitution may be made
10 by payment of an amount fixed by the court or by working for the parties
11 sustaining loss in the manner ordered by the court. An order of monetary
12 restitution shall be a judgment against the juvenile that may be collected
13 by the court by garnishment or other execution as on judgments in civil
14 cases. Such judgment shall not be affected by the termination of the court's
15 jurisdiction over the juvenile offender.
16 (e) If the court imposes a fine pursuant to subsection (a)(8), the
17 following provisions apply:
18 (1) The amount of the fine may not exceed $1,000 for each offense.
19 The amount of the fine should be related to the seriousness of the offense
20 and the juvenile's ability to pay. Payment of a fine may be required in a
21 lump sum or installments;
22 (2) in determining whether to impose a fine and the amount to be
23 imposed, the court shall consider that imposition of a fine is most
24 appropriate in cases where the juvenile has derived pecuniary gain from
25 the offense and that imposition of a restitution order is preferable to
26 imposition of a fine; and
27 (3) any fine imposed by the court shall be a judgment against the
28 juvenile that may be collected by the court by garnishment or other
29 execution as on judgments in civil cases. Such judgment shall not be
30 affected by the termination of the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile.
31 (f) Before the court sentences a juvenile offender pursuant to
32 subsection (a), the court shall administer a risk assessment tool, as
33 described in K.S.A. 38-2360, and amendments thereto, or review a risk
34 assessment tool that was administered within the past six months to the
35 juvenile and use the results of that assessment to inform orders made
36 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2369 and 38-2391, and amendments thereto.
37 (g) If the court commits the juvenile to detention pursuant to
38 subsection (a)(11), the following provisions shall apply:
39 (1) The court shall only order commitment to detention upon
40 violation of sentencing conditions where all other alternatives have been
41 exhausted.
42 (2) In order to commit a juvenile to detention upon violation of
43 sentencing conditions, the court shall find that the juvenile poses a

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 7
1 significant risk of harm to another or damage to property, is charged with a
2 new felony offense, or violates conditional release.
3 (3) The court shall not order commitment to detention upon
4 adjudication as a juvenile offender pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2356, and
5 amendments thereto, for solely technical violations of probation, contempt,
6 a violation of a valid court order, to protect from self-harm or due to any
7 state or county failure to find adequate alternatives.
8 (4) Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a maximum of 45
9 {90} days over the course of a juvenile offender's case pursuant to K.S.A.
10 38-2391, and amendments thereto. The court shall review any detention
11 commitment every seven days and may shorten the initial commitment or
12 extend the commitment. In no case, however, may the term of detention or
13 any extension thereof exceed the cumulative detention limit of 45 {90}
14 days or the overall case length limit.
15 (5) A juvenile over 18 years of age and less than 23 years of age at
16 sentencing shall be committed to a county jail, in lieu of a juvenile
17 detention center, under the same time restrictions imposed by paragraph
18 (1), but shall not be committed to or confined in a juvenile detention
19 facility.
20 (h) Any order issued by the judge pursuant to this section shall be in
21 effect immediately upon entry into the court's minutes.
22 (i) In addition to the requirements of K.S.A. 38-2373, and
23 amendments thereto, if a person is under 18 years of age and convicted of
24 a felony or adjudicated as a juvenile offender for an offense if committed
25 by an adult would constitute the commission of a felony, the court shall
26 forward a signed copy of the journal entry to the secretary of corrections
27 within 30 days of final disposition.
28 (j) (1) Except as further provided, if a juvenile has been adjudged to
29 be a juvenile offender for an offense which, if committed by an adult
30 would constitute the commission of: (1) (A) Aggravated human
31 trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b), and amendments thereto, if
32 the victim is less than 14 years of age; (2) (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A.
33 21-5503(a)(3), and amendments thereto; (3) (C) aggravated indecent
34 liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5506(b)(3), and amendments
35 thereto; (4) (D) aggravated criminal sodomy, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
36 5504(b)(1) or (b)(2), and amendments thereto; (5) (E) commercial sexual
37 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-6422, and amendments
38 thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; (6) (F) sexual
39 exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1) or (a)(4), and
40 amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age; or (7) (G)
41 an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in K.S.A. 21-
42 5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an offense defined
43 in paragraphs (1) through (6); subparagraphs (A) through (F).

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 8
1 (2) The court shall issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from
2 attending the attendance center that the victim of the offense attends. If
3 only one attendance center exists, for which the victim and juvenile are
4 eligible to attend, in the school district where the victim and the juvenile
5 reside, the court shall hear testimony and take evidence from the victim,
6 the juvenile, their families and a representative of the school district as to
7 why the juvenile should or should not be allowed to remain at the
8 attendance center attended by the victim. After such hearing, the court may
9 issue an order prohibiting the juvenile from attending the attendance center
10 that the victim of the offense attends.
11 (k) The court may order a short-term alternative placement of a
12 juvenile pursuant to subsection (a)(3) in an emergency shelter, therapeutic
13 foster home or community integration program if:
14 (1) Such juvenile has been adjudicated to be a juvenile offender for
15 an offense which, if committed by an adult would constitute the
16 commission of:
17 (A) Aggravated human trafficking, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5426(b),
18 and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of age;
19 (B) rape, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5503, and amendments thereto;
20 (C) commercial sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A.
21 21-6422, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
22 age;
23 (D) sexual exploitation of a child, as defined in K.S.A. 21-5510(a)(1)
24 or (a)(4), and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
25 age;
26 (E) aggravated indecent liberties with a child, as defined in K.S.A.
27 21-5506, and amendments thereto, if the victim is less than 14 years of
28 age; or
29 (F) an attempt, conspiracy or criminal solicitation, as defined in
30 K.S.A. 21-5301, 21-5302 or 21-5303, and amendments thereto, of an
31 offense defined in paragraphs (1) through (4) subparagraphs (A) through
32 (E); and
33 (2) (A) the victim resides in the same home as the juvenile offender;
34 (B) a community supervision officer in consultation with the
35 department for children and families determines that an adequate safety
36 plan, which shall include the physical and psychological well-being of the
37 victim, cannot be developed to keep the juvenile in the same home; and
38 (C) there are no relevant child in need of care issues that would
39 permit a case to be filed under the Kansas code for care of children.
40 The presumptive term of commitment shall not extend beyond the
41 overall case length limit but may be modified pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2367
42 and 38-2397, and amendments thereto. If a child is placed outside the
43 child's home at the dispositional hearing pursuant to this subsection and no

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 9
1 reintegration plan is made a part of the record of the hearing, a written
2 reintegration plan shall be prepared pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2397, and
3 amendments thereto, and submitted to the court within 15 days of the
4 initial order of the court.
5 (l) If the court orders a short-term alternative placement of a juvenile
6 pursuant to subsection (k), the secretary shall be responsible for the costs
7 associated with all aspects of such placement. The secretary shall contract
8 with emergency shelters and therapeutic foster homes in order to facilitate
9 the placement of juvenile offenders pursuant to subsection (k).
10 (m) The sentencing hearing shall be open to the public as provided in
11 K.S.A. 38-2353, and amendments thereto.
12 (m)(n) The overall case length limit shall be calculated by the court
13 and entered into the written record when one or more of the sentencing
14 options under this section are imposed. The period fixed by the court
15 pursuant to subsection (a) shall not extend beyond the overall case length
16 limit.
17 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 38-2365 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
18 2365. (a) When a juvenile offender has been placed in the custody of the
19 secretary, the secretary shall have a reasonable time to make a placement.
20 If the juvenile offender has not been placed, any party who believes that
21 the amount of time elapsed without placement has exceeded a reasonable
22 time may file a motion for review with the court. In determining what is a
23 reasonable amount of time, matters considered by the court shall include,
24 but not be limited to, the nature of the underlying offense, efforts made for
25 placement of the juvenile offender and the availability of a suitable
26 placement. The secretary shall notify the court, the juvenile's attorney of
27 record and the juvenile's parent, in writing, of the initial placement and any
28 subsequent change of placement as soon as the placement has been
29 accomplished. The notice to the juvenile offender's parent shall be sent to
30 such parent's last known address or addresses. Except as provided in
31 K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the court shall have no power to direct a specific
32 placement by the secretary, but may make recommendations to the
33 secretary. Except as provided in K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(10), the secretary may
34 place the juvenile offender in an institution operated by the secretary, a
35 youth residential facility or any other appropriate placement. If the court
36 has recommended an out-of-home placement, the secretary may not return
37 the juvenile offender to the home from which removed without first
38 notifying the court of the plan.
39 (b) If a juvenile is in the custody of the secretary, the secretary shall
40 prepare and present a permanency plan at sentencing or within 30 days
41 thereafter. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older and the juvenile is
42 able, the secretary shall prepare the permanency plan in consultation with
43 the juvenile. If a permanency plan is already in place under a child in need

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 10
1 of care proceeding, the court may adopt the plan under the present
2 proceeding. The written permanency plan shall provide for reintegration of
3 the juvenile into such juvenile's family or, if reintegration is not a viable
4 alternative, for other permanent placement of the juvenile. Reintegration
5 may not be a viable alternative when: (1) The parent has been found by a
6 court to have committed murder in the first degree, K.S.A. 21-3401, prior
7 to its repeal, or K.S.A. 21-5402, and amendments thereto, murder in the

12 of a child or violated a law of another state which prohibits such murder or
13 manslaughter of a child;
14 (2) the parent aided or abetted, attempted, conspired or solicited to
15 commit such murder or voluntary manslaughter of a child;
16 (3) the parent committed a felony battery that resulted in bodily
17 injury to the juvenile who is the subject of this proceeding or another
18 child;
19 (4) the parent has subjected the juvenile who is the subject of this
20 proceeding or another child to aggravated circumstances as defined in
21 K.S.A. 38-1502, and amendments thereto;
22 (5) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been
23 terminated involuntarily; or
24 (6) the juvenile has been in extended out-of-home placement as
25 defined in K.S.A. 38-2202, and amendments thereto.
26 (c) If the juvenile is placed in the custody of the secretary, the plan
27 shall be prepared and submitted by the secretary. If the juvenile is placed
28 in the custody of a facility or person other than the secretary, the plan shall
29 be prepared and submitted by a court services officer. If the permanency
30 goal is reintegration into the family, the permanency plan shall include
31 measurable objectives and time schedules for reintegration.
32 (d) During the time a juvenile remains in the custody of the secretary,
33 the secretary shall submit to the court, at least every six months, a written
34 report of the progress being made toward the goals of the permanency plan
35 submitted pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and the specific actions taken
36 to achieve the goals of the permanency plan. If the juvenile is placed in
37 foster care, the court may request the foster parent to submit to the court,
38 at least every six months, a report in regard to the juvenile's adjustment,
39 progress and condition. Such report shall be made a part of the juvenile's
40 court social file. The court shall review the plan submitted by the secretary
41 and the report, if any, submitted by the foster parent and determine
42 whether reasonable efforts and progress have been made to achieve the
43 goals of the permanency plan. If the court determines that progress is

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 11
1 inadequate or that the permanency plan is no longer viable, the court shall
2 hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (e).
3 (e) When the secretary has custody of the juvenile, a permanency
4 hearing shall be held no more than 12 months after the juvenile is first
5 placed outside such juvenile's home and at least every 12 months
6 thereafter. Juvenile offenders who have been in extended out-of-home
7 placement shall be provided a permanency hearing within 30 days of a
8 request from the secretary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to
9 represent the juvenile offender at the permanency hearing. At the
10 permanency hearing, the court shall determine whether and, if applicable,
11 when the juvenile will be:
12 (1) Reintegrated with the juvenile's parents;
13 (2) placed for adoption;
14 (3) placed with a permanent custodian; or
15 (4) if the juvenile is 16 years of age or older and the secretary has
16 documented compelling reasons why it would not be in the juvenile's best
17 interests for a placement in one of the placements pursuant to paragraphs
18 (1), (2) or (3), placed in another planned permanent arrangement.
19 (f) At each permanency hearing, the court shall:
20 (1) Make a written finding as to whether reasonable efforts have been
21 made to accomplish the permanency goal and whether continued out-of-
22 home placement is necessary for the juvenile's safety;
23 (2) make a written finding as to whether the reasonable and prudent
24 parenting standard has been met and whether the juvenile has regular,
25 ongoing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate
26 activities. The secretary shall report to the court the steps the secretary is
27 taking to ensure that the reasonable and prudent parenting standard is
28 being met and that the juvenile has regular, ongoing opportunities to
29 engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities, including
30 consultation with the juvenile in an age-appropriate manner about the
31 opportunities of the juvenile to participate in the activities; and
32 (3) if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, document the efforts
33 made by the secretary to help the juvenile prepare for the transition from
34 custody to a successful adulthood. The secretary shall report to the court
35 the programs and services that are being provided to the juvenile which
36 will help the juvenile prepare for the transition from custody to a
37 successful adulthood.
38 (g) The requirements of this subsection shall apply only if the
39 permanency goal in place at the time of the hearing is another planned
40 permanent arrangement as described in subsection (e)(4). At each
41 permanency hearing held with respect to the juvenile, in addition to the
42 requirements of subsection (f), the court shall:
43 (1) Ask the juvenile, if the juvenile is able, by attendance at the

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 12
1 hearing or by report to the court, about the desired permanency outcome
2 for the juvenile;
3 (2) document the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
4 unsuccessful permanency efforts made by the secretary to return the
5 juvenile home or secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing
6 relative, a legal guardian or an adoptive parent. The secretary shall report
7 to the court the intensive, ongoing and, as of the date of the hearing,
8 unsuccessful efforts made by the secretary to return the juvenile home or
9 secure a placement for the juvenile with a fit and willing relative, a legal
10 guardian or an adoptive parent, including efforts that utilize search
11 technology, including social media, to find biological family members of
12 the children; and
13 (3) make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of
14 the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best
15 permanency plan for the juvenile and provide compelling reasons why it
16 continues to not be in the best interests of the juvenile to return home, be
17 placed for adoption, be placed with a legal guardian or be placed with a fit
18 and willing relative.
19 (h) Whenever a hearing is required under subsection (e), the court
20 shall notify all interested parties of the hearing date, the secretary, foster
21 parent and preadoptive parent or relatives providing care for the juvenile
22 and hold a hearing. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, the court
23 shall require notice of the time and place of the permanency hearing be
24 given to the juvenile. Such notice shall request the juvenile's participation
25 in the hearing by attendance or by report to the court. Individuals receiving
26 notice pursuant to this subsection shall not be made a party to the action
27 solely on the basis of this notice and opportunity to be heard. After
28 providing the persons receiving notice an opportunity to be heard, the
29 court shall determine whether the juvenile's needs are being adequately
30 met; whether services set out in the permanency plan necessary for the
31 safe return of the juvenile have been made available to the parent with
32 whom reintegration is planned; and whether reasonable efforts and
33 progress have been made to achieve the goals of the permanency plan.
34 (i) If the court finds reintegration continues to be a viable alternative,
35 the court shall determine whether and, if applicable, when the juvenile will
36 be returned to the parent. The court may rescind any of its prior
37 dispositional orders and enter any dispositional order authorized by this
38 code or may order that a new plan for the reintegration be prepared and
39 submitted to the court. If reintegration cannot be accomplished as
40 approved by the court, the court shall be informed and shall schedule a
41 hearing pursuant to subsection (j). No such hearing is required when the
42 parent voluntarily relinquishes parental rights or agrees to appointment of
43 a permanent guardian.

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 13
1 (j) When the court finds any of the following conditions exist, the
2 county or district attorney or the county or district attorney's designee shall
3 file a petition alleging the juvenile to be a child in need of care and
4 requesting termination of parental rights pursuant to the Kansas code for
5 care of children:
6 (1) The court determines that reintegration is not a viable alternative
7 and either adoption or permanent guardianship might be in the best
8 interests of the juvenile;
9 (2) the goal of the permanency plan is reintegration into the family
10 and the court determines after 12 months from the time such plan is first
11 submitted that progress is inadequate; or
12 (3) the juvenile has been in out-of-home placement for a cumulative
13 total of 15 of the last 22 months, excluding trial home visits and juvenile in
14 runaway status.
15 Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to prohibit termination of
16 parental rights prior to the expiration of 12 months.
17 (k) A petition to terminate parental rights is not required to be filed if
18 one of the following exceptions is documented to exist:
19 (1) The juvenile is in a stable placement with relatives;
20 (2) services set out in the case plan necessary for the safe return of
21 the juvenile have not been made available to the parent with whom
22 reintegration is planned; or
23 (3) there are one or more documented reasons why such filing would
24 not be in the best interests of the juvenile. Documented reasons may
25 include, but are not limited to: The juvenile has close emotional bonds
26 with a parent which should not be broken; the juvenile is 14 years of age
27 or older and, after advice and counsel, refuses to be adopted; insufficient
28 grounds exist for termination of parental rights; the juvenile is an
29 unaccompanied refugee minor; or there are international legal or
30 compelling foreign policy reasons precluding termination of parental
31 rights.
32 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 38-2369 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-
33 2369. (a) Except as provided in subsection (e) and K.S.A. 38-2361(a)(13),

37 harm to another or damage to property, the following placements shall be
38 applied by the judge in the cases specified in this subsection. If used, the
39 court shall establish a specific term of commitment as specified in this
40 subsection. The term of commitment established by the court shall not

38 juvenile adjudications. An out-of-state offense, which if committed by an
39 adult would constitute the commission of a felony or misdemeanor, shall
40 be classified as either a felony or a misdemeanor according to the

43 will be deemed a felony in Kansas. The state of Kansas shall classify the

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 16
1 offense, which if committed by an adult would constitute the commission
2 of a felony or misdemeanor, as person or nonperson. In designating such

11 chronic offender category and offenders at least 10 years of age but less
12 than 14 years of age in the serious offender II or III category, shall be
13 placed in the custody of the secretary for placement in a youth residential
14 facility in lieu of placement in the juvenile correctional facility. The
15 secretary shall ensure timely placement of such offender in a youth
16 residential facility and shall be responsible for the costs associated with
17 all aspects of such placement in accordance with K.S.A. 38-2399, and
18 amendments thereto, This presumption may be rebutted by a finding on the
19 record that the juvenile offender poses a significant risk of physical harm
20 to another.
21 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 38-2391 is hereby amended to read as
22 follows: 38-2391. (a) Upon adjudication as a juvenile offender

30 court shall not exceed the overall case length limit.
31 (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the overall case length
32 limit shall be calculated based on the adjudicated offense and the
33 results of a risk and needs assessment, as follows:
34 (1) Offenders adjudicated for a misdemeanor may remain under

42 constitute an off-grid felony or a nondrug severity level 1 through 4
43 person felony.

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 17
1 (d) When a juvenile is adjudicated for multiple counts, the
2 maximum overall case length shall be calculated based on the most
3 severe adjudicated count or any other adjudicated count at the court's

5 consecutively.
6 (e) When the juvenile is adjudicated for multiple cases
7 simultaneously, the court shall run such cases concurrently.

12 probation pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361, and amendments thereto, the
13 court shall establish a specific term of probation as specified in this
14 subsection based on the most serious adjudicated count in
15 combination with the results of a risk and needs assessment, as
16 follows, except that the term of probation shall not exceed the overall
17 case length limit:

24 (C) high-risk offenders adjudicated for a felony may be placed on
25 probation for a term up to 12 months.
26 (2) The court may extend the term of probation if a juvenile
27 needs time to complete an evidence-based program as determined to
28 be necessary based on the results of a validated risk and needs
29 assessment and, if necessary, may extend the overall case length limit
30 to allow for completion of such program when failure to complete such
31 program is due to a repeated, intentional effort to delay by the
32 juvenile as reported by the evidence-based services provider. The
33 court may also extend the term of probation for good cause shown for
34 one month for low-risk offenders, three months for moderate-risk
35 offenders and six months for high-risk offenders. Prior to extension of
36 the initial probationary term, the court shall find and enter into the
37 written record the criteria permitting extension of probation.
38 Extensions of probation and the overall case length limit shall only be
39 granted incrementally. When the court extends the term of probation
40 for a juvenile offender, the court services officer or community
41 correctional services officer responsible for monitoring such juvenile
42 offender shall record the reason given for extending probation. Court
43 services officers shall report such records to the office of judicial

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 18
1 administration, and community correctional services officers shall
2 report such records to the department of corrections. The office of
3 judicial administration and the department of corrections shall report
4 such recorded data to the Kansas juvenile justice oversight committee
5 on a quarterly basis.
6 (3) The probation term limits do not apply to those offenders

9 and amendments thereto, aggravated criminal sodomy as defined in
10 K.S.A. 21-5504(b)(3), and amendments thereto, or murder in the
11 second degree as defined in K.S.A. 21-5403, and amendments thereto.
12 Such offenders may be placed on probation for a term consistent with
13 the overall case length limit.
14 (4) The probation term limits and overall case length limits
15 provided in this section shall be tolled during any time that the
16 offender has absconded from supervision while on probation, and the
17 time on such limits shall not start to run again until the offender is
18 located and brought back to the jurisdiction.
19 (h) For the purpose of placing juvenile offenders in detention
20 pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2361 and 38-2369, and amendments thereto, the
21 court shall establish a specific term of detention. The term of detention
22 shall not exceed the overall case length limit or the cumulative
23 detention limit. Cumulative detention use shall be limited to a
24 maximum of 45 90 days over the course of the juvenile offender's case,
25 except that there shall be no limit on cumulative detention for juvenile

30 15 days after adjudication, whichever is sooner, unless the juvenile
31 fails to appear for such juvenile's dispositional hearing. If a juvenile

33 term limits and overall case length limits provided in this section shall
34 not apply until the juvenile is brought before the court for disposition
35 in such juvenile's case.
36 (j) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the revised
37 Kansas juvenile justice code.
38 Sec. 4. 5. K.S.A. 38-2399 is hereby amended to read as follows: 38-

31 shall determine and certify to the director of accounts and reports the
32 amount in each account of the state general fund of a state agency that has
33 been determined by the secretary to be actual or projected cost savings as a

9 reports or information are in regard to abuse or neglect, which is
10 required to be reported under K.S.A. 38-2223, and amendments
11 thereto, such records, reports or information may then be used for any
12 purpose in a child in need of care proceeding pursuant to the revised
13 Kansas code for care of children.
14 (2) Such records, reports and information may be used in a
15 juvenile offender proceeding only if such records, reports and
16 information are in regard to the possible trafficking of a runaway.
17 Such records, reports and information in regard to the possible
18 trafficking of a runaway shall be made available to the appropriate
19 county or district attorney and the court, and shall be used only for
20 diagnostic and referral purposes.
21 (c) Upon a juvenile being taken into custody pursuant to K.S.A.
22 38-2330, and amendments thereto, a juvenile intake and assessment
23 worker shall complete the intake and assessment process, making
24 release and referral determinations as required by supreme court
25 administrative order or district court rule, or except as provided
26 above [in] rules and regulations established by the secretary of
27 corrections.
28 (d) Except as provided in subsection (g) and in addition to any

9 (1) Release the child to the custody of the child's parent, other
10 legal guardian or another appropriate adult.
11 (2) Conditionally release the child to the child's parent, other
12 legal guardian or another appropriate adult if the intake and
13 assessment worker believes that if the conditions are met, it would be
14 in the child's best interest to release the child to such child's parent,
15 other legal guardian or another appropriate adult; and the intake and
16 assessment worker has reason to believe that it might be harmful to
17 the child to release the child to such child's parents, other legal
18 guardian or another appropriate adult without imposing the
19 conditions. The conditions may include, but not be limited to the
20 alternatives listed in K.S.A. 38-2331(b), and amendments thereto, and

41 or licensed attendant care facility shall then have custody as if the
42 child had been directly delivered to the facility by the law enforcement
43 officer pursuant to K.S.A. 38-2232, and amendments thereto.

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 27
1 (4) The intake and assessment worker shall also refer the

25 function that may be approved by the court for use under certain
26 circumstances. If approved by the court, the juvenile intake and
27 assessment worker or the court may override the detention risk
28 assessment tool score in order to direct placement in a short-term
29 shelter facility, a community-based alternative to detention or, subject
30 to K.S.A. 38-2331, and amendments thereto, a juvenile detention
31 facility. Such override must be documented, include a written
32 explanation and receive approval from the director of the intake and
33 assessment center or the court.

38 juvenile in a juvenile detention facility.
39 (4) If a juvenile meets one or more eligibility criteria for detention
40 or referral to a community-based alternative to detention, the person
41 with authority to detain shall maintain discretion to release the
42 juvenile if other less restrictive measures would be adequate.
43 (g) Parents, guardians and juveniles may access the juvenile

HB 2329—Am. by HCW 28

2 guardian shall be responsible for the costs of any such program
3 utilized.
