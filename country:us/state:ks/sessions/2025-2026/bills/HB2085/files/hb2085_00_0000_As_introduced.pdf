9 Section 1. K.S.A. 65-166a is hereby amended to read as follows: 65-
10 166a. (a) The secretary of health and environment is authorized and
11 directed to establish by duly adopted rules or regulations a schedule of fees
12 to defray all or any part of the costs of administering the water pollution
13 control permit system established by K.S.A. 65-165 and 65-166, and
14 amendments thereto. The amount of the fees so established shall be based
15 upon the quantity of raw wastes or treated wastes to be discharged, units of
16 design capacity of treatment facilities or structures, numbers of potential
17 pollution units, physical or chemical characteristics of discharges and staff
18 time necessary for review and evaluation of proposed projects. In
19 establishing the fee schedule, the secretary of health and environment shall
20 not assess fees for permits required in the extension of a sewage collection
21 system, but such fees shall be assessed for all treatment devices, facilities
22 or discharges where a permit is required by law and is issued by the
23 secretary of health and environment or the secretary's designated
24 representative. Such fees shall be nonrefundable.
25 (b) Any such permit for which a fee is assessed shall expire five 10
26 years from the date of its issuance. The secretary of health and
27 environment may issue permits pursuant to K.S.A. 65-165, and
28 amendments thereto, for terms of less than five 10 years, if the secretary
29 determines valid cause exists for issuance of the permit with a term of less
30 than five 10 years. The minimum fee assessed for any permit issued
31 pursuant to K.S.A. 65-165, and amendments thereto, shall be for not less
32 than one year. Permit fees may be assessed and collected on an annual
33 basis and failure to pay the assessed fee shall be cause for revocation of
34 the permit. Any permit which that has expired or has been revoked may be

HB 2085 2
1 reissued upon payment of the appropriate fee and submission of a new
2 application for a permit as provided in K.S.A. 65-165 and 65-166, and
3 amendments thereto.
4 (c) A permit shall be required for:
5 (1) Any confined feeding facility with an animal unit capacity of 300
6 to through 999, if the secretary determines that the facility has significant
7 water pollution potential; and
8 (2) any confined feeding facility with an animal unit capacity of
9 1,000 or more.

11 facility exceed:
12 (1) $25 for facilities with an animal unit capacity of not more than
13 999;
14 (2) $100 for facilities with an animal unit capacity of 1,000 to
15 through 4,999;
16 (3) $200 for facilities with an animal unit capacity of 5,000 to
17 through 9,999; or
18 (4) $400 for facilities with an animal unit capacity of 10,000 or more.
19 (e) Annual permit fees for any truck washing facility for animal
20 wastes shall be as follows:
21 (1) For a private truck washing facility for animal wastes with two or
22 fewer trucks, not more than $25;
23 (2) for a private truck washing facility for animal wastes with three or
24 more trucks, not more than $200; and
25 (3) for a commercial truck washing facility for animal wastes, not
26 more than $320.
27 (f) The secretary of health and environment shall remit all moneys
28 received from the fees established pursuant to this act to the state treasurer
29 in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments
30 thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall
31 deposit the entire amount in the state treasury to the credit of the water
32 program management fund created in K.S.A. 65-166b, and amendments
33 thereto.
34 (g) Any confined feeding facility with an animal unit capacity of less
35 fewer than 300 may be required to obtain a permit from the secretary if the
36 secretary determines that such facility has significant water pollution
37 potential.
38 (h) Any confined feeding facility not otherwise required to obtain a
39 permit or certification may obtain a permit or certification from the
40 secretary. Any such facility obtaining a permit shall pay an annual permit
41 fee of not more than $25.
42 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 65-166a is hereby repealed.
