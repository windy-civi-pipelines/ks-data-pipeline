42 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 44-1001 is hereby amended to read as follows: 44-
43 1001. This act shall be known as the Kansas act against discrimination. It

HB 2299—Am. by HC 3
1 shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the state for the
2 protection of the public welfare, safety, health and peace of the people of
3 this state. The practice or policy of discrimination against individuals in
4 employment relations, in relation to free and public accommodations, in
5 housing by reason of race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or
6 ancestry or in housing by reason of familial status is a matter of concern to
7 the state, since such discrimination threatens not only the rights and
8 privileges of the inhabitants of the state of Kansas but menaces the
9 institutions and foundations of a free democratic state. It is hereby
10 declared to be the policy of the state of Kansas to eliminate and prevent
11 discrimination in all employment relations, to eliminate and prevent
12 discrimination, segregation, or separation in all places of public
13 accommodations covered by this act, and to eliminate and prevent
14 discrimination, segregation or separation in housing.
15 It is also declared to be the policy of this state to assure equal
16 opportunities and encouragement to every citizen regardless of race,
17 religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry, in securing and
18 holding, without discrimination, employment in any field of work or labor
19 for which a person is properly qualified, to assure equal opportunities to all
20 persons within this state to full and equal public accommodations, and to
21 assure equal opportunities in housing without distinction on account of
22 race, religion, color, sex, disability, familial status, national origin or
23 ancestry. It is further declared that the opportunity to secure and to hold
24 employment, the opportunity for full and equal public accommodations as
25 covered by this act and the opportunity for full and equal housing are civil
26 rights of every citizen.
27 It is also declared to be the policy of this state that public institutions
28 that receive and expend tax dollars are prohibited from engaging in
29 practices or implementing policies that are antisemitic or otherwise
30 promote antisemitism. It is further declared to be the policy of the state
31 that no person shall be required to participate in programing or training
32 that promotes or degrades any one religion and that governmental entities
33 are prohibited from enacting policies that promote or degrade any one
34 religion.
35 To protect these rights, it is hereby declared to be the purpose of this act
36 to establish and to provide a state commission having power to eliminate
37 and prevent segregation and discrimination, or separation in employment,
38 in all places of public accommodations covered by this act, in housing
39 because of race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry
40 and in housing because of familial status, either by employers, labor
41 organizations, employment agencies, realtors, financial institutions or
42 other persons as hereinafter provided.
43 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 44-1004 is hereby amended to read as follows: 44-

HB 2299—Am. by HC 4
1 1004. The commission shall have the following functions, powers and

15 (5)(e) To subpoena witnesses, compel their appearance and require
16 the production for examination of records, documents and other evidence
17 or possible sources of evidence and to examine, record and copy such
18 materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons.
19 The commission may issue subpoenas to compel access to or the
20 production of such materials, or the appearance of such persons, and may
21 issue interrogatories to a respondent to the same extent and subject to the
22 same limitations as would apply if the subpoena or interrogatories were
23 issued or served in aid of a civil action in the district court. The
24 commission shall have access at all reasonable times to premises and may
25 compel such access by application to a court of competent jurisdiction
26 provided that the commission first complies with the provisions of article
27 15 of the Kansas bill of rights and the fourth amendment to the United
28 States constitution relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The
29 commission may administer oaths and take depositions to the same extent
30 and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the deposition was
31 taken in aid of a civil action in the district court. In case of the refusal of
32 any person to comply with any subpoena, interrogatory or search warrant
33 issued hereunder, or to testify to any matter regarding which such person
34 may be lawfully questioned, the district court of any county may, upon
35 application of the commission, order such person to comply with such
36 subpoena or interrogatory and to testify. Failure to obey the court's order
37 may be punished by the court as contempt. No person shall be prosecuted
38 or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any
39 transaction, matter or thing concerning which such person testifies or
40 produces evidence, except that such person so testifying shall not be
41 exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so
42 testifying. The immunity herein provided shall extend only to natural
43 persons.

11 1005. (a) Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful
12 employment practice or by an alleged unlawful discriminatory practice,
13 and who can articulate a prima facie case pursuant to a recognized legal
14 theory of discrimination, may, personally or by an attorney-at-law, make,
15 sign and file with the commission a verified complaint in writing,
16 articulating the prima facie case, which shall also state the name and
17 address of the person, employer, labor organization or employment agency
18 alleged to have committed the unlawful employment practice complained
19 of or the name and address of the person alleged to have committed the
20 unlawful discriminatory practice complained of, and which shall set forth
21 the particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be
22 required by the commission.
23 (b) (1) The commission upon its own initiative or the attorney general
24 may, in like manner, make, sign and file such complaint. Whenever the
25 attorney general has sufficient reason to believe that any person as herein
26 defined is engaged in a practice of discrimination, segregation or
27 separation in violation of this act, the attorney general may make, sign and
28 file a complaint. Any employer whose employees or some of whom, refuse
29 or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of this act, may file
30 with the commission a verified complaint asking for assistance by
31 conciliation or other remedial action.
32 (2) (A) In addition to making, signing and filing a complaint, the
33 attorney general may investigate the alleged unlawful employment
34 practice or alleged unlawful discriminatory practice. During the course of
35 such investigation, the attorney general may:
36 (i) Subpoena witnesses, evidence, records, documents or other
37 material related to the complaint;
38 (ii) take testimony under oath;
39 (iii) examine or cause to be examined any records or other material
40 that is relevant to the complaint;
41 (iv) require a person to attend any proceeding and provide testimony
42 under oath regarding any material that is relevant to the complaint;
43 (v) serve interrogatories; and

HB 2299—Am. by HC 7
1 (vi) administer oaths and affirmations.
2 (B) The attorney general may file a petition in the district court
3 where the alleged unlawful employment practice or alleged unlawful
4 discriminatory practice occurred seeking damages in an amount not to
5 exceed $10,000 for each violation.
6 (c) Whenever any problem of discrimination because of race,
7 religion, color, sex, disability, national origin or ancestry arises, or
8 whenever the commission has, in its own judgment, reason to believe that
9 any person has engaged in an unlawful employment practice or an
10 unlawful discriminatory practice in violation of this act, or has engaged in
11 a pattern or practice of discrimination, the commission may conduct an
12 investigation without filing a complaint and shall have the same powers
13 during such investigation as provided for the investigation of complaints.
14 The person to be investigated shall be advised of the nature and scope of
15 such investigation prior to its commencement. The purpose of the
16 investigation shall be to resolve any such problems promptly. In the event
17 such problems cannot be resolved within a reasonable time, the
18 commission may issue a complaint whenever the investigation has
19 revealed a violation of the Kansas act against discrimination has occurred.
20 The information gathered in the course of the first investigation may be
21 used in processing the complaint.
22 (d) After the filing of any complaint by an aggrieved individual, by
23 the commission, or by the attorney general, the commission shall, within
24 seven days after the filing of the complaint, serve a copy on each of the
25 parties alleged to have violated this act, and shall designate one of the
26 commissioners to make, with the assistance of the commission's staff,
27 prompt investigation of the alleged act of discrimination. If the
28 commissioner shall determine after such investigation that no probable
29 cause exists for crediting the allegations of the complaint, such
30 commissioner, within 10 business days from such determination, shall
31 cause to be issued and served upon the complainant and respondent written
32 notice of such determination.
33 (e) If such commissioner after such investigation, shall determine that
34 probable cause exists for crediting the allegations for the complaint, the
35 commissioner or such other commissioner as the commission may
36 designate, shall immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful
37 employment practice or the unlawful discriminatory practice complained
38 of by conference and conciliation. The complainant, respondent and
39 commission shall have 45 days from the date respondent is notified in
40 writing of a finding of probable cause to enter into a conciliation
41 agreement signed by all parties in interest. The parties may amend a
42 conciliation agreement at any time prior to the date of entering into such
43 agreement. Upon agreement by the parties the time for entering into such

HB 2299—Am. by HC 8
1 agreement may be extended. The members of the commission and its staff
2 shall not disclose what has transpired in the course of such endeavors.
3 (f) In case of failure to eliminate such practices by conference and
4 conciliation, or in advance thereof, if in the judgment of the commissioner
5 or the commission circumstances so warrant, the commissioner or the
6 commission shall commence a hearing in accordance with the provisions
7 of the Kansas administrative procedure act naming as parties the
8 complainant and the person, employer, labor organization, employment
9 agency, realtor or financial institution named in such complaint,
10 hereinafter referred to as respondent. A copy of the complaint shall be
11 served on the respondent. At least four commissioners or a presiding
12 officer from the office of administrative hearings shall be designated as the
13 presiding officer. The place of such hearing shall be in the county where
14 respondent is doing business and the acts complained of occurred.
15 (g) The complainant or respondent may apply to the presiding officer
16 for the issuance of a subpoena for the attendance of any person or the
17 production or examination of any books, records or documents pertinent to
18 the proceeding at the hearing. Upon such application the presiding officer
19 shall issue such subpoena.
20 (h) The case in support of the complaint shall be presented before the
21 presiding officer by one of the commission's attorneys or agents, or by
22 private counsel, if any, of the complainant, and the commissioner who
23 shall have previously made the investigation shall not participate in the
24 hearing except as a witness. Any endeavors at conciliation shall not be
25 received in evidence.
26 (i) Any complaint filed pursuant to this act must be so filed within six
27 months after the alleged act of discrimination, unless the act complained of
28 constitutes a continuing pattern or practice of discrimination in which
29 event it will be from the last act of discrimination. Complaints filed with
30 the commission may be dismissed by the commission on its own initiative,
31 and shall be dismissed by the commission upon the written request of the
32 complainant, if the commission has not issued a finding of probable cause
33 or no probable cause or taken other administrative action dismissing the
34 complaint within 300 days of the filing of the complaint. The commission
35 shall mail written notice to all parties of dismissal of a complaint within
36 five days of dismissal. Any such dismissal of a complaint in accordance
37 with this section shall constitute final action by the commission which
38 shall be deemed to exhaust all administrative remedies under the Kansas
39 act against discrimination for the purpose of allowing subsequent filing of
40 the matter in court by the complainant, without the requirement of filing a
41 petition for reconsideration pursuant to K.S.A. 44-1010, and amendments
42 thereto. Dismissal of a complaint in accordance with this section shall not
43 be subject to appeal or judicial review by any court under the provisions of

HB 2299—Am. by HC 9
1 K.S.A. 44-1011, and amendments thereto. The provisions of this section
2 shall not apply to complaints alleging discriminatory housing practices
3 filed with the commission pursuant to K.S.A. 44-1015 et seq., and
4 amendments thereto.
5 (j) The respondent may file a written verified answer to the complaint
6 and appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without counsel,
7 and submit testimony. The complainant shall appear at such hearing in
8 person, with or without counsel, and submit testimony. The presiding
9 officer or the complainant shall have the power reasonably and fairly to
10 amend any complaint, and the respondent shall have like power to amend
11 such respondent's answer. The presiding officer shall be bound by the rules
12 of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity, and only relevant
13 evidence of reasonable probative value shall be received.
14 (k) If the presiding officer finds a respondent has engaged in or is
15 engaging in any unlawful employment practice or unlawful discriminatory
16 practice as defined in this act, the presiding officer shall render an order
17 requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such unlawful
18 employment practice or such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take
19 such affirmative action, including but not limited to the hiring,
20 reinstatement, or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, and
21 the admission or restoration to membership in any respondent labor
22 organizations; the admission to and full and equal enjoyment of the goods,
23 services, facilities, and accommodations offered by any respondent place
24 of public accommodation denied in violation of this act, as, in the
25 judgment of the presiding officer, will effectuate the purposes of this act,
26 and including a requirement for report of the manner of compliance. Such
27 order may also include an award of damages for pain, suffering and
28 humiliation which are incidental to the act of discrimination, except that an
29 award for such pain, suffering and humiliation shall in no event exceed the
30 sum of $2,000 $10,000.
31 (l) Any state, county or municipal agency may pay a complainant
32 back pay if it has entered into a conciliation agreement for such purposes
33 with the commission, and may pay such back pay if it is ordered to do so
34 by the commission.
35 (m) If the presiding officer finds that a respondent has not engaged in
36 any such unlawful employment practice, or any such unlawful
37 discriminatory practice, the presiding officer shall render an order
38 dismissing the complaint as to such respondent.
39 (n) The commission shall review an initial order rendered under
40 subsection (k) or (m). In addition to the parties, a copy of any final order
41 shall be served on the attorney general and such other public officers as the
42 commission may deem proper.
43 (o) The commission shall, except as otherwise provided, establish

HB 2299—Am. by HC 10
1 rules of practice to govern, expedite and effectuate the foregoing
2 procedure and its own actions thereunder. The rules of practice shall be
3 available, upon written request, within 30 days after the date of adoption.
