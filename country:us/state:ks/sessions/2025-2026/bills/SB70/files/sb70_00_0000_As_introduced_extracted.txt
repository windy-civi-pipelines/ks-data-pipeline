19 payment of the prescribed fee. A public agency shall not be required to
20 provide copies of radio or recording tapes or discs, video tapes or films,

24 required to provide such items or devices which are copyrighted by a
25 person other than the public agency.
26 (b) Copies of public records shall be made while the records are in
27 the possession, custody and control of the custodian or a person designated
28 by the custodian and shall be made under the supervision of such

12 within the legislative branch of the state government shall be established in
13 accordance with K.S.A. 46-1207a, and amendments thereto.
14 (4) Fees for access to or copies of public records of public agencies
15 within the judicial branch of the state government shall be established in
16 accordance with rules of the supreme court.
17 (5) Fees for access to or copies of public records of a public agency
18 within the executive branch of the state government shall be established by
19 the agency head. Any person requesting records may appeal the
20 reasonableness of the fees charged for providing access to or furnishing
21 copies of such records to the secretary of administration whose decision
22 shall be final.
23 (6) A fee for copies of public records which is equal to or less than
24 $.25 per page shall be deemed a reasonable fee. A fee for electronic copies
25 of public records which is equal to or less than $.125 per page shall be
26 deemed a reasonable fee.
27 (d) Except as otherwise authorized pursuant to K.S.A. 75-4215, and
28 amendments thereto, each public agency within the executive branch of
29 the state government shall remit all moneys received by or for it from fees
30 charged pursuant to this section to the state treasurer in accordance with
31 K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise specifically

33 in the state treasury and credit the same to the state general fund or an
34 appropriate fee fund as determined by the agency head.
35 (e) Each public agency of a political or taxing subdivision shall remit
36 all moneys received by or for it from fees charged pursuant to this act to
37 the treasurer of such political or taxing subdivision at least monthly. Upon
38 receipt of any such moneys, such treasurer shall deposit the entire amount
39 thereof in the treasury of the political or taxing subdivision and credit the
40 same to the general fund thereof, unless otherwise specifically provided by
41 law.
42 (f) Any person who is a certified shorthand reporter may charge fees
43 for transcripts of such person's notes of judicial or administrative

SB 70 3
1 proceedings in accordance with rates established pursuant to rules of the
2 Kansas supreme court.
3 (g) Nothing in the open records act shall require a public agency to
4 electronically make copies of public records by allowing a person to obtain
5 copies of a public record by inserting, connecting or otherwise attaching
6 an electronic device provided by such person to the computer or other
7 electronic device of the public agency.
8 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 45-221 is hereby amended to read as
