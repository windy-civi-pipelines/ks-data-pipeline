16 219. (a) Any person may make abstracts or obtain copies of any public
17 record to which such person has access under this act. If copies are
18 requested, the public agency may require a written request and advance
19 payment of the prescribed fee. A public agency shall not be required to
20 provide copies of radio or recording tapes or discs, video tapes or films,
21 pictures, slides, graphics, illustrations or similar audio or visual items or
22 devices, unless such items or devices were shown or played to a public
23 meeting of the governing body thereof, but the public agency shall not be

25 person other than the public agency.
26 (b) Copies of public records shall be made while the records are in
27 the possession, custody and control of the custodian or a person designated
28 by the custodian and shall be made under the supervision of such
29 custodian or person. When practical, copies shall be made in the place
30 where the records are kept. If it is impractical to do so, the custodian shall
31 allow arrangements to be made for use of other facilities. If it is necessary
32 to use other facilities for copying, the cost thereof shall be paid by the
33 person desiring a copy of the records. In addition, the public agency may
34 charge the same fee for the services rendered in supervising the copying as
35 for furnishing copies under subsection (c) and may establish a reasonable
36 schedule of times for making copies at other facilities.

SB 70—Am. by SC 2
1 (c) Except as provided by subsection (f) or where fees for inspection
2 or for copies of a public record are prescribed by statute, each public
3 agency may prescribe reasonable fees for providing access to or furnishing

11 (3) Fees for access to or copies of public records of public agencies
12 within the legislative branch of the state government shall be established in
13 accordance with K.S.A. 46-1207a, and amendments thereto.
14 (4) Fees for access to or copies of public records of public agencies
15 within the judicial branch of the state government shall be established in
16 accordance with rules of the supreme court.
17 (5) Fees for access to or copies of public records of a public agency
18 within the executive branch of the state government shall be established by
19 the agency head. Any person requesting records may appeal the
20 reasonableness of the fees charged for providing access to or furnishing
21 copies of such records to the secretary of administration whose decision
22 shall be final.
23 (6) A fee for copies of public records which is equal to or less than
24 $.25 per printed page shall be deemed a reasonable fee. A No per page or
25 copy fee shall be charged for electronic copies of public records which is
26 equal to or less than $.125 per page shall be deemed a reasonable fee. If a
27 fee is charged for the cost of staff time required to make information
28 available, no fee for printed copies of public records shall be charged
29 pursuant to this paragraph.
30 (d) Except as otherwise authorized pursuant to K.S.A. 75-4215, and
31 amendments thereto, each public agency within the executive branch of
32 the state government shall remit all moneys received by or for it from fees
33 charged pursuant to this section to the state treasurer in accordance with
34 K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Unless otherwise specifically
35 provided by law, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount thereof
36 in the state treasury and credit the same to the state general fund or an
37 appropriate fee fund as determined by the agency head.
38 (e) Each public agency of a political or taxing subdivision shall remit
39 all moneys received by or for it from fees charged pursuant to this act to
40 the treasurer of such political or taxing subdivision at least monthly. Upon
41 receipt of any such moneys, such treasurer shall deposit the entire amount
42 thereof in the treasury of the political or taxing subdivision and credit the
43 same to the general fund thereof, unless otherwise specifically provided by

SB 70—Am. by SC 3
1 law.
2 (f) Any person who is a certified shorthand reporter may charge fees
3 for transcripts of such person's notes of judicial or administrative
4 proceedings in accordance with rates established pursuant to rules of the
5 Kansas supreme court.
6 (g) Nothing in the open records act shall require a public agency to
7 electronically make copies of public records by allowing a person to obtain
8 copies of a public record by inserting, connecting or otherwise attaching
9 an electronic device provided by such person to the computer or other
10 electronic device of the public agency.
