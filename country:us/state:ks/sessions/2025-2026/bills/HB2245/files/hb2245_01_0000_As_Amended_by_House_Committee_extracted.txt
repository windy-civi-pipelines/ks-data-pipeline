13 and safety program under subsection (f). For the purposes of K.S.A. 44-
14 575 through 44-580, and amendments thereto, all state agencies are hereby
15 deemed to be a single employer whose liabilities specified in this section
16 are hereby imposed solely upon the state workers compensation self-

32 compensation self-insurance fund first became liable to make such
33 payments.
34 (e) The secretary of health and environment commissioner of
35 insurance shall remit all moneys received by or for the secretary
36 commissioner in the capacity as administrator of the state workers
37 compensation self-insurance fund, to the state treasurer in accordance with
38 the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt

40 in the state treasury to the credit of the state workers compensation self-
41 insurance fund.
42 (f) There is hereby established the state workplace health and safety
43 program within the state workers compensation self-insurance program of

HB 2245—Am. by HC 8
1 the insurance department of health and environment. The secretary of

23 compensation self-insurance fund. Such claims shall be served upon the
24 secretary of health and environment commissioner of insurance in the
25 secretary's commissioner's capacity as administrator of the state workers
26 compensation self-insurance fund in the manner provided for claims
27 against other employers under the workers compensation act. The chief
28 attorney for the insurance department of health and environment, or

31 workers compensation self-insurance fund in all proceedings under the
32 workers compensation act.
33 (b) The secretary of health and environment commissioner of

36 For the purposes of such investigations, the secretary of health and
37 environment commissioner of insurance is authorized to obtain expert
38 medical advice regarding the injuries, occupational diseases and
39 disabilities involved in such claims. If, based upon such investigation and
40 any other available information, the secretary of health and environment
41 commissioner of insurance finds that there is no material dispute as to any
42 issue involved in the claim, that the claim is valid and that the claim
43 should be settled by agreement, the secretary of health and environment

HB 2245—Am. by HC 9
1 commissioner of insurance may proceed to enter into such an agreement
2 with the claimant, for the state workers compensation self-insurance fund.
3 Any such agreement may provide for lump-sum settlements subject to
