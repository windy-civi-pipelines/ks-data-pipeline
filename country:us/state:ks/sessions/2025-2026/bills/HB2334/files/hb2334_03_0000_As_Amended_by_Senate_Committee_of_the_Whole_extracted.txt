18 protected cell captive insurance company with respect to each protected
19 cell. A plan of operation includes, but is not limited to, the specific
20 business objectives and investment guidelines of the protected cell, except
21 that the commissioner may require additional information in the plan of
22 operation. The commissioner may put into effect a plan of operation or

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 4
1 cell;
2 (5) an incorporated protected cell may be organized and operated in
3 any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
4 including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability
5 company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company
6 act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell captive insurer
7 shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this act and shall have
8 the power to enter into contracts, including an individual series of a limited
9 liability company. Unless otherwise permitted by the organizational
10 documents of a protected cell captive insurer, each incorporated protected
11 cell of the protected cell captive insurer shall have the same directors,
12 secretary and registered office as the protected cell captive insurer; and
13 (6) all attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell
14 and the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
15 and participant contracts approved by the commissioner. No other
16 attribution of assets or liabilities shall be made by a protected cell captive
17 insurance company between the protected cell captive insurance
18 company's general account and its protected cells. Any attribution of assets
19 and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell shall be in
20 cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.
21 (b) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to
22 such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell captive
23 insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated cell.
24 Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including assets
25 transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned by the
26 protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall be, or
27 represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of
28 such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
29 subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may allow for a
30 security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell
31 account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise
32 allowed under applicable law.
33 (c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
34 captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an
35 investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or other third party to
36 manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
37 expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager are
38 payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not from
39 the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
40 protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
41 (d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
42 administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify
43 the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive insurance

1 company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
2 attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell captive
3 insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell
4 liabilities:
5 (A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities
6 of the protected cell captive insurance company's general account; and
7 (B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
8 identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
9 attributable to other protected cells.
10 (2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
11 applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
12 assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
13 insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not be
14 construed as an exclusive remedy.
15 (e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
16 insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value that is
17 at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to
18 such protected cell.
19 (f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the books
20 and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to reflect the
21 financial condition and results of operations of such protected cell, net
22 income or loss, dividends or other distributions to participants and such
23 other factors as may be provided in the participant contract or required by
24 the commissioner.
25 (g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
26 arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell captive
27 insurance company may conduct.
28 (h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
29 such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any of
30 its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
31 (i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution shall
32 be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive insurance
33 company or participant without the commissioner's approval. In no event
34 shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale, exchange, transfer,
35 dividend or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment of a
36 protected cell.
37 (j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells and
38 the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
39 approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets or liabilities
40 shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance company between its
41 general account and any protected cell or between any protected cells. The
42 protected cell captive insurance company shall attribute all insurance
43 obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a reinsurance contract entered
HB 2334—Am. by SCW 6
1 into with respect to a protected cell to such protected cell. The
2 performance under such reinsurance contract and any tax benefits, losses,
3 refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax allocation agreement to which
4 the protected cell captive insurance company is a party, including any
5 payments made by or due to be made to the protected cell captive
6 insurance company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, shall reflect
7 the insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to the reinsurance
8 contract that are attributed to such protected cell.
9 (k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation
10 of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets and liabilities of a
11 protected cell shall, to the extent that the commissioner determines that
12 such assets and liabilities are separable, at all times be kept separate from
13 and shall not be commingled with those of other protected cells and the
14 protected cell captive insurance company.
15 (l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually file
16 with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
17 commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without limitation,
18 accounting statements detailing the financial experience of each protected
19 cell.
20 (m) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall notify the
21 commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell that
22 is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense obligations.
23 (n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
24 commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new protected
25 cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of any existing
26 protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of operation requiring
27 the commissioner's prior written approval.
28 (o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
29 company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
30 (1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any
31 state;
32 (2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state; or
33 (3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
34 policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or
35 other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The amount of
36 security provided shall be not less than the reserves associated with those
37 liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured, including reserves for
38 losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
39 and unearned premiums for business written through the participant's
40 protected cell. The commissioner may require the protected cell captive
41 insurance company to increase the funding of any security arrangement
42 established under this subsection. If the form of security is a letter of
43 credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved
HB 2334—Am. by SCW 7
1 by the commissioner. A trust maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
2 be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the
3 commissioner.
4 (p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in addition
5 to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
6 amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected cell
7 captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines that one
8 or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may separate
9 such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company and may
10 allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance company, for
11 the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing
12 protected cell captive insurance companies or one or more other captive
13 insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of operation as the

24 other prior contractual agreement, the assets of one protected cell may not

38 (g)(h) Information submitted under this section shall be and remain
39 confidential, and shall not be made public by the commissioner or any
40 employee or agent of the commissioner without the written consent of the
41 company, except that:

23 attorneys and to such other interested persons as the court may order upon
24 a showing of good cause;
25 (2) the commissioner may disclose such information to a public
26 officer having jurisdiction over the regulation of insurance in another state,
27 provided that:
28 (A) Such public official shall agree in writing to maintain the
29 confidentiality of such information; and
30 (B) the laws of the state in which such public official serves requires
31 such information to be and to remain confidential;
32 (3) access may also be granted to the national association of
33 insurance commissioners and its affiliates, and the international

35 writing prior to receiving the information to provide to it the same
36 confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the company
37 gives prior written consent; and
38 (4) the privacy of those who have established an affiliated fidfin trust

4 trustor, the trustee, the custodian, any beneficiary, their attorneys and to
5 such other interested persons as the court may order upon a showing of
6 good cause.
7 Sec. 12.{13.} K.S.A. 40-4304 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 40-4304. (a) No captive insurance company shall be issued a certificate of
9 authority unless it such company shall possess and thereafter maintain

19 (b) Such capital may be in the form of cash or, upon approval of the
20 commissioner, an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank chartered by
21 the state of Kansas or the United States comptroller of currency, domiciled
22 in Kansas, and approved by the commissioner.
23 (c) In connection with the issuance of a certificate of authority, the
24 commissioner may prescribe additional minimum capital and surplus
25 based upon the type, volume and nature of the insurance business
26 transacted.
27 (d) Loans of minimum capital and surplus funds shall be prohibited.
28 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum capital and surplus funds
29 may be received by the issuance of a surplus note as approved by the
30 commissioner.
31 (e) No pure captive insurance company shall make a loan or an
32 investment in its parent company or affiliates without prior written
33 approval of the commissioner, and any such loan or investment shall be

35 Sec. 13.{14.} K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-4308 is hereby amended to read
36 as follows: 40-4308. (a) Whenever the commissioner deems necessary, but
37 at least once every three five years, the commissioner may make, or direct
38 to be made, a financial examination of any captive insurance company in
39 the process of organization or applying for admission or doing business in
40 Kansas. The commissioner may engage in continuous analysis for the
41 preparation of the examination. In addition, at the commissioner's
42 discretion, the commissioner may make, or direct to be made, a market
43 regulation examination of any insurance company doing business in
HB 2334—Am. by SCW 16
1 Kansas.
2 (b) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of
3 examinations of financial condition, the commissioner shall consider such
4 matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in
5 management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent
6 certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's
7 handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners
8 in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this subsection.
9 (c) The commissioner shall have free access to the books and papers
10 of any such company that relate to its business and to the books and papers
11 kept by any of its agents and may examine under oath, which the
12 commissioner shall be empowered to administer, the directors, officers,
13 agents or employees of any such company in relation to its affairs,
14 transactions and condition.
15 (d) For the purpose of such analysis, the commissioner may require
16 reports and other documents be filed with the commissioner.
17 (e) The commissioner may also examine or investigate any person, or
18 the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is,
19 in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the
20 examination of the company, but such examination or investigation shall
21 not infringe upon or extend to any communications or information
22 accorded privileged or confidential status under any other laws of this
23 state.
24 (f) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the
25 commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall appoint one or more
26 examiners to perform the examination and instruct such examiners as to
27 the scope of the examination. The commissioner may also employ such
28 other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
29 (g) When making an examination under this act, the commissioner
30 may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent
31 certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as
32 examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be paid by the company that
33 is the subject of the examination.
34 (h) (1) Not later than 30 days following completion of the
35 examination or at such earlier time as the commissioner shall prescribe,
36 the examiner in charge shall file with the deparment a verified written
37 report of examination under oath. Not later than 30 days following receipt
38 of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the
39 company examined, together with a notice that shall afford such company
40 examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than 30 days to make a
41 written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the
42 examination report.
43 (2) Within 30 days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of
HB 2334—Am. by SCW 17
1 written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and
2 review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and
3 any relevant portions of the examiners' workpapers, and enter an order:
4 (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or
5 corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating
6 in violation of any law, rule and regulation or prior order of the
7 commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any
8 action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure such
9 violations;
10 (B) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners
11 to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data,
12 documentation or information; or
13 (C) call for and conduct a fact-finding hearing in accordance with
14 K.S.A. 40-281, and amendments thereto, for purposes of obtaining
15 additional documentation, data, information and testimony.
16 (3) All orders entered as a result of revelations contained in the final
17 examination report shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions
18 resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the
19 examination report, relevant examiner work papers and any written
20 submissions or rebuttals. Within 30 days of the issuance of the adopted
21 report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors
22 stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and
23 related orders.
24 (4) Upon the adoption of the examination report of an association
25 captive insurance company, the commissioner shall hold the content of the
26 examination report as private and confidential as to the pure captive
27 insurance company. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to
28 limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make
29 public any final or preliminary examination report in the furtherance of
30 any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the
31 commissioner's discretion, deem appropriate.
32 (i) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the
33 commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order
34 to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of
35 this state.
36 (j) All examination reports, preliminary examination reports or
37 results, working papers, recorded information, documents and copies
38 thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any
39 other person in the course of an examination made under this section are
40 confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public
41 by the commissioner or an employee or agent of the commissioner without
42 the written consent of the company, except to the extent provided in this
43 subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the commissioner
HB 2334—Am. by SCW 18
1 from using such information in furtherance of the commissioner's
2 regulatory authority under this act. The commissioner may grant access to
3 such information to public officers having jurisdiction over the regulation
4 of insurance in any other state or country or to law enforcement officers of
5 Kansas or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time.
6 Access may also be granted to the national association of insurance
7 commissioners and its affiliates and the international association of
8 insurance supervisors and its affiliates. Persons receiving such information
9 must agree in writing prior to receiving the information to provide to it the
10 same confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the prior
11 written consent of the company to which it pertains has been obtained.
12 (k) The commissioner may receive documents, materials or
13 information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents,
14 materials or information, from the national association of insurance
15 commissioners, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and from regulatory and
16 law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions and
17 shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material or
18 information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential
19 or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the
20 document, material or information. Documents received pursuant to this
21 section shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to the open records act,
22 K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., and amendments thereto.
23 Sec. 14.{15.} K.S.A. 40-4312 is hereby amended to read as follows:

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 4

3 any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
4 including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability
5 company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company
6 act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell captive insurer
7 shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this act and shall have
8 the power to enter into contracts, including an individual series of a limited
9 liability company. Unless otherwise permitted by the organizational
10 documents of a protected cell captive insurer, each incorporated protected
11 cell of the protected cell captive insurer shall have the same directors,
12 secretary and registered office as the protected cell captive insurer; and
13 (6) all attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell

19 and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell shall be in
20 cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.
21 (b) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to
22 such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell captive
23 insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated cell.
24 Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including assets
25 transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned by the
26 protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall be, or
27 represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of
28 such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
29 subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may allow for a
30 security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell
31 account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise
32 allowed under applicable law.
33 (c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
34 captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an

36 manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
37 expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager are
38 payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not from
39 the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
40 protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
41 (d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
42 administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify
43 the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive insurance

1 company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
2 attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell captive
3 insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell
4 liabilities:
5 (A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities
6 of the protected cell captive insurance company's general account; and
7 (B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
8 identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
9 attributable to other protected cells.
10 (2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
11 applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
12 assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
13 insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not be
14 construed as an exclusive remedy.
15 (e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
16 insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value that is
17 at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to
18 such protected cell.
19 (f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the books
20 and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to reflect the
21 financial condition and results of operations of such protected cell, net
22 income or loss, dividends or other distributions to participants and such
23 other factors as may be provided in the participant contract or required by
24 the commissioner.
25 (g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
26 arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell captive
27 insurance company may conduct.
28 (h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
29 such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any of
30 its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
31 (i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution shall
32 be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive insurance
33 company or participant without the commissioner's approval. In no event
34 shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale, exchange, transfer,
35 dividend or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment of a
36 protected cell.
37 (j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells and
38 the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
39 approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets or liabilities
40 shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance company between its
41 general account and any protected cell or between any protected cells. The
42 protected cell captive insurance company shall attribute all insurance
43 obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a reinsurance contract entered

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 6
1 into with respect to a protected cell to such protected cell. The
2 performance under such reinsurance contract and any tax benefits, losses,
3 refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax allocation agreement to which
4 the protected cell captive insurance company is a party, including any
5 payments made by or due to be made to the protected cell captive
6 insurance company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, shall reflect
7 the insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to the reinsurance
8 contract that are attributed to such protected cell.
9 (k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation
10 of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets and liabilities of a
11 protected cell shall, to the extent that the commissioner determines that
12 such assets and liabilities are separable, at all times be kept separate from
13 and shall not be commingled with those of other protected cells and the
14 protected cell captive insurance company.
15 (l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually file
16 with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
17 commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without limitation,
18 accounting statements detailing the financial experience of each protected
19 cell.
20 (m) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall notify the
21 commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell that
22 is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense obligations.
23 (n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
24 commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new protected
25 cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of any existing
26 protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of operation requiring
27 the commissioner's prior written approval.
28 (o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
29 company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
30 (1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any
31 state;
32 (2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state; or
33 (3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
34 policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or
35 other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The amount of
36 security provided shall be not less than the reserves associated with those
37 liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured, including reserves for
38 losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
39 and unearned premiums for business written through the participant's
40 protected cell. The commissioner may require the protected cell captive
41 insurance company to increase the funding of any security arrangement
42 established under this subsection. If the form of security is a letter of
43 credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 7
1 by the commissioner. A trust maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
2 be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the
3 commissioner.
4 (p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in addition
5 to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
6 amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected cell
7 captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines that one
8 or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may separate
9 such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company and may
10 allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance company, for
11 the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing
12 protected cell captive insurance companies or one or more other captive
13 insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of operation as the

38 (g)(h) Information submitted under this section shall be and remain
39 confidential, and shall not be made public by the commissioner or any
40 employee or agent of the commissioner without the written consent of the
41 company, except that:
42 (1) Such information may be discoverable by a party in a civil action
43 or contested case to which the captive insurance company that submitted

24 a showing of good cause;
25 (2) the commissioner may disclose such information to a public
26 officer having jurisdiction over the regulation of insurance in another state,
27 provided that:
28 (A) Such public official shall agree in writing to maintain the
29 confidentiality of such information; and
30 (B) the laws of the state in which such public official serves requires
31 such information to be and to remain confidential;
32 (3) access may also be granted to the national association of
33 insurance commissioners and its affiliates, and the international
34 association of supervisors and its affiliates. Such parties must agree in
35 writing prior to receiving the information to provide to it the same
36 confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the company
37 gives prior written consent; and
38 (4) the privacy of those who have established an affiliated fidfin trust

43 or custodian, annual verified report of the trustee or custodian and all

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 15
1 petitions relevant to trust administration and all court orders thereon shall

5 such other interested persons as the court may order upon a showing of
6 good cause.
7 Sec. 12.{13.} K.S.A. 40-4304 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 40-4304. (a) No captive insurance company shall be issued a certificate of
9 authority unless it such company shall possess and thereafter maintain

18 company.
19 (b) Such capital may be in the form of cash or, upon approval of the
20 commissioner, an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank chartered by
21 the state of Kansas or the United States comptroller of currency, domiciled
22 in Kansas, and approved by the commissioner.
23 (c) In connection with the issuance of a certificate of authority, the
24 commissioner may prescribe additional minimum capital and surplus
25 based upon the type, volume and nature of the insurance business
26 transacted.
27 (d) Loans of minimum capital and surplus funds shall be prohibited.
28 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum capital and surplus funds
29 may be received by the issuance of a surplus note as approved by the
30 commissioner.
31 (e) No pure captive insurance company shall make a loan or an
32 investment in its parent company or affiliates without prior written
33 approval of the commissioner, and any such loan or investment shall be

35 Sec. 13.{14.} K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-4308 is hereby amended to read
36 as follows: 40-4308. (a) Whenever the commissioner deems necessary, but
37 at least once every three five years, the commissioner may make, or direct
38 to be made, a financial examination of any captive insurance company in
39 the process of organization or applying for admission or doing business in
40 Kansas. The commissioner may engage in continuous analysis for the
41 preparation of the examination. In addition, at the commissioner's
42 discretion, the commissioner may make, or direct to be made, a market
43 regulation examination of any insurance company doing business in

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 16
1 Kansas.
2 (b) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of
3 examinations of financial condition, the commissioner shall consider such
4 matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in
5 management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent
6 certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's
7 handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners
8 in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this subsection.
9 (c) The commissioner shall have free access to the books and papers
10 of any such company that relate to its business and to the books and papers
11 kept by any of its agents and may examine under oath, which the
12 commissioner shall be empowered to administer, the directors, officers,
13 agents or employees of any such company in relation to its affairs,
14 transactions and condition.
15 (d) For the purpose of such analysis, the commissioner may require
16 reports and other documents be filed with the commissioner.
17 (e) The commissioner may also examine or investigate any person, or
18 the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is,
19 in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the
20 examination of the company, but such examination or investigation shall
21 not infringe upon or extend to any communications or information
22 accorded privileged or confidential status under any other laws of this
23 state.
24 (f) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the
25 commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall appoint one or more
26 examiners to perform the examination and instruct such examiners as to
27 the scope of the examination. The commissioner may also employ such
28 other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
29 (g) When making an examination under this act, the commissioner
30 may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent
31 certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as
32 examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be paid by the company that
33 is the subject of the examination.
34 (h) (1) Not later than 30 days following completion of the
35 examination or at such earlier time as the commissioner shall prescribe,
36 the examiner in charge shall file with the deparment a verified written
37 report of examination under oath. Not later than 30 days following receipt
38 of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the
39 company examined, together with a notice that shall afford such company
40 examined a reasonable opportunity of not more than 30 days to make a
41 written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the
42 examination report.
43 (2) Within 30 days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 17
1 written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and
2 review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and
3 any relevant portions of the examiners' workpapers, and enter an order:
4 (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or
5 corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating
6 in violation of any law, rule and regulation or prior order of the
7 commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any
8 action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure such
9 violations;
10 (B) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners
11 to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data,
12 documentation or information; or
13 (C) call for and conduct a fact-finding hearing in accordance with
14 K.S.A. 40-281, and amendments thereto, for purposes of obtaining
15 additional documentation, data, information and testimony.
16 (3) All orders entered as a result of revelations contained in the final
17 examination report shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions
18 resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the
19 examination report, relevant examiner work papers and any written
20 submissions or rebuttals. Within 30 days of the issuance of the adopted
21 report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors
22 stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and
23 related orders.
24 (4) Upon the adoption of the examination report of an association
25 captive insurance company, the commissioner shall hold the content of the
26 examination report as private and confidential as to the pure captive
27 insurance company. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to
28 limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make
29 public any final or preliminary examination report in the furtherance of
30 any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the
31 commissioner's discretion, deem appropriate.
32 (i) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the
33 commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order
34 to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of
35 this state.
36 (j) All examination reports, preliminary examination reports or
37 results, working papers, recorded information, documents and copies
38 thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any
39 other person in the course of an examination made under this section are
40 confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public
41 by the commissioner or an employee or agent of the commissioner without
42 the written consent of the company, except to the extent provided in this
43 subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the commissioner

HB 2334—Am. by SCW 18
1 from using such information in furtherance of the commissioner's
2 regulatory authority under this act. The commissioner may grant access to
3 such information to public officers having jurisdiction over the regulation
4 of insurance in any other state or country or to law enforcement officers of
5 Kansas or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time.
6 Access may also be granted to the national association of insurance
7 commissioners and its affiliates and the international association of
8 insurance supervisors and its affiliates. Persons receiving such information
9 must agree in writing prior to receiving the information to provide to it the
10 same confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the prior
11 written consent of the company to which it pertains has been obtained.
12 (k) The commissioner may receive documents, materials or
13 information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents,
14 materials or information, from the national association of insurance
15 commissioners, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and from regulatory and
16 law enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions and
17 shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material or
18 information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential
19 or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the
20 document, material or information. Documents received pursuant to this
21 section shall not be subject to disclosure pursuant to the open records act,
22 K.S.A. 45-215 et seq., and amendments thereto.
23 Sec. 14.{15.} K.S.A. 40-4312 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 40-4312. No captive insurance company shall be required to join a rating
25 organization or a policy form organization.
26 Sec. 15.{16.} K.S.A. 40-4314 is hereby amended to read as follows:

5 subsection (b), and no such tax shall be payable in connection with the
