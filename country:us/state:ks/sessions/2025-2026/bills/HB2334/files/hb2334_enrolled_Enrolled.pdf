(a) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company may establish
one or more protected cells if the commissioner has approved in writing
a plan of operation or amendments to a plan of operation submitted by
the protected cell captive insurance company with respect to each
protected cell. A plan of operation includes, but is not limited to, the
specific business objectives and investment guidelines of the protected
cell, except that the commissioner may require additional information
in the plan of operation. The commissioner may put into effect a plan of

obligations with respect to its insurance business to the protected cell;
(3) a protected cell shall have its own distinct name or designation
that shall include the words "protected cell" or "incorporated cell." An
incorporated cell formed as a series of a limited liability company shall
bear a distinct name or designation as reflected in its formation
documents and include the words "series cell." Such names or

(4) the protected cell captive insurance company shall transfer all
assets attributable to a protected cell to one or more separately

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 3
of such protected cell;
(5) an incorporated protected cell may be organized and operated
in any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability
company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability
company act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell
captive insurer shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this
act and shall have the power to enter into contracts, including an
individual series of a limited liability company. Unless otherwise
permitted by the organizational documents of a protected cell captive
insurer, each incorporated protected cell of the protected cell captive
insurer shall have the same directors, secretary and registered office as
the protected cell captive insurer; and
(6) all attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell
and the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of
operation and participant contracts approved by the commissioner. No
other attribution of assets or liabilities shall be made by a protected cell
captive insurance company between the protected cell captive
insurance company's general account and its protected cells. Any
attribution of assets and liabilities between the general account and a
protected cell shall be in cash or in readily marketable securities with
established market values.
(b) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to
such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell
captive insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated
cell. Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including
assets transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned
by the protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall
be, or represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell
assets of such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may
allow for a security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a
protected cell account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell
and otherwise allowed under applicable law.
(c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an
investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or other third party to
manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager
are payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not
from the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
(d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly
identify the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive
insurance company and the protected cell assets and protected cell
liabilities attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected
cell captive insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and
protected cell liabilities:
(A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and
liabilities of the protected cell captive insurance company's general
account; and
(B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
attributable to other protected cells.
(2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not
be construed as an exclusive remedy.
(e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value
that is at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities
attributed to such protected cell.

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 4
(f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the
books and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to
reflect the financial condition and results of operations of such
protected cell, net income or loss, dividends or other distributions to
participants and such other factors as may be provided in the participant
contract or required by the commissioner.
(g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell
captive insurance company may conduct.
(h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any
of its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
(i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution
shall be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive
insurance company or participant without the commissioner's approval.
In no event shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale,
exchange, transfer, dividend or distribution would result in the
insolvency or impairment of a protected cell.
(j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells
and the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of
operation approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets
or liabilities shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance
company between its general account and any protected cell or between
any protected cells. The protected cell captive insurance company shall
attribute all insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a
reinsurance contract entered into with respect to a protected cell to such
protected cell. The performance under such reinsurance contract and
any tax benefits, losses, refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax
allocation agreement to which the protected cell captive insurance
company is a party, including any payments made by or due to be made
to the protected cell captive insurance company pursuant to the terms of
such agreement, shall reflect the insurance obligations, assets and
liabilities relating to the reinsurance contract that are attributed to such
protected cell.
(k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or
liquidation of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets
and liabilities of a protected cell shall, to the extent that the
commissioner determines that such assets and liabilities are separable,
at all times be kept separate from and shall not be commingled with
those of other protected cells and the protected cell captive insurance
company.
(l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually
file with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without
limitation, accounting statements detailing the financial experience of
each protected cell.
(m) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall notify the
commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell
that is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense
obligations.
(n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new
protected cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of
any existing protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of
operation requiring the commissioner's prior written approval.
(o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
(1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of
any state;
(2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state;
or
(3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit
or other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 5
amount of security provided shall be not less than the reserves
associated with those liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured,
including reserves for losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses,
incurred but not reported losses and unearned premiums for business
written through the participant's protected cell. The commissioner may
require the protected cell captive insurance company to increase the
funding of any security arrangement established under this subsection.
If the form of security is a letter of credit, the letter of credit shall be
issued or confirmed by a bank approved by the commissioner. A trust
maintained pursuant to this subsection shall be established in a form
and upon such terms approved by the commissioner.
(p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in
addition to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
and amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected
cell captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines
that one or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may
separate such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company
and may allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance
company, for the conversion of such protected cells into one or more
new or existing protected cell captive insurance companies or one or
more other captive insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of
operation as the commissioner deems acceptable.
(q) Biographical affidavits shall not be required for participants in
unincorporated cells. Biographical affidavits shall be required for
owners of incorporated cells, including series members of a series LLC.
(r) A protected cell captive insurance company formed or licensed
under this act may establish and operate unincorporated and
incorporated protected cells.
New Sec. 6. (a) Associations, corporations, limited liability
companies, partnerships, trusts and other business entities may be
participants in any protected cell captive insurance company formed or
licensed under this chapter.

insurance company.
(c) A participant shall not be required to be a shareholder of the
protected cell captive insurance company or any affiliate thereof.
(d) A participant shall insure only such participant's own risks
through a protected cell captive insurance company, unless otherwise
approved by the commissioner.
New Sec. 7. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4, and
amendments thereto, the assets of two or more protected cells may be
combined for purposes of investment, and such combination shall not
be construed as defeating the segregation of such assets for accounting
or other purposes.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the
commissioner may approve the use of alternative reliable methods of
valuation and rating.
New Sec. 8. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section the
insurers supervision, rehabilitation and liquidation act shall apply to a
protected cell captive insurance company.
(b) Upon any order of supervision, rehabilitation, or liquidation of
a protected cell captive insurance company, the receiver shall manage
the assets and liabilities of the protected cell captive insurance
company pursuant to this section.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of the insurers supervision,
rehabilitation and liquidation act:
(1) No assets of a protected cell shall be used to pay any expenses
or claims other than those attributable to such protected cell; and
(2) a protected cell captive insurance company's capital and
surplus shall be available at all times to pay any expenses of or claims
against the protected cell captive insurance company.
New Sec. 9. (a) The pleadings in any legal action brought by or
against a protected cell captive insurance company shall specify which
protected cell or cells should be named as a party to the suit. If the

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 6
general account is party to this suit, it shall be separately identified in
the pleadings as if it were a protected cell.
(b) A legal action brought against a protected cell captive
insurance company that does not specify one or more protected cells
shall be deemed to have been brought against the general account only.
(c) Any protected cell that is not named in the pleadings of the
legal action shall not be deemed to be a party to the legal action. Any
protected cell that is erroneously named as a party or named without
proper cause shall be entitled to prompt dismissal from the legal action.
(d) Unless specified by the plan of operation, participant contract
or other prior contractual agreement, the assets of one protected cell
may not be encumbered or seized to satisfy the obligations of or a
judgment against any other protected cell. No protected cell shall have
a duty to defend the rights and obligations of any other protected cell.
(e) In any legal action involving a protected cell captive insurance
company or a protected cell, any papers, documents or property of a
nonparty protected cell shall be afforded the same status during
discovery as the documents or property of any other unrelated third
party. A nonparty protected cell shall have standing to appear and
petition for any appropriate relief to protect the confidentiality of its
papers or documents.
New Sec. 10. (a) (1) Upon the application of a protected cell
captive insurance company, one of its protected cells may be converted
to any form of captive insurance company authorized pursuant to
chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto,
with the consent of the commissioner. The commissioner may issue to
the converting protected cell a certificate of authority with an effective
date of its original date of formation as a protected cell.
(2) The following shall be the criteria for determining the filing or
submission requirements of:
(A) A series of a limited liability company, the cell shall file
organizational documents with the secretary of state that comply with
article 43 of chapter 40 and chapters 17 and 56A of the Kansas Statutes
Annotated, and amendments thereto, as applicable. The organizational

conversion, the formation date of the series shall be deemed as the
formation date of the new entity. The new entity shall possess all assets
and liabilities, including outstanding insurance liabilities, owned by the
predecessor series;
(B) any other type of incorporated protected cell entity, then the
converting protected cell shall submit amended organizational
documents to the secretary of state that comply with article 43 of
chapter 40 and chapters 17 and 56A of the Kansas Statutes Annotated,
and amendments thereto, as applicable; or
(C) neither a series of a limited liability company nor an
incorporated protected cell, the cell shall file organizational documents
with the secretary of state that comply with article 43 of chapter 40 and
chapters 17 and 56A of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
amendments thereto, as applicable, or any other applicable provision
governing formation of that type of entity. The organizational
documents shall include the date of formation as a cell. Upon
conversion, the formation date of the cell shall be deemed as the
formation date of the new entity. The new entity shall possess all assets
and liabilities, including outstanding insurance liabilities, owned by the
predecessor cell.
(b) A captive insurance company may apply to the commissioner
for conversion to become a protected cell captive insurance company
under any form permitted under this section. Upon compliance with
this section, approval by the commissioner and the filing of amended
organizational documents with the secretary of state, the captive
insurance company shall be issued a revised certificate of authority.
The effective date of the revised protected cell captive insurance
company's certificate of authority shall remain the same as the effective
date of the prior captive insurance company.

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 7
New Sec. 11. (a) A foreign or alien insurer may become a

pursuant to this section may be organized under any lawful corporate
form permitted by chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
amendments thereto.
(b) A redomestication pursuant to this section shall be authorized
for insurance companies domiciled in foreign or alien jurisdictions that
authorize the redomestication of insurance companies if, as a result of
the actions taken by the company pursuant to this section to
redomesticate to this state, such insurance company will no longer be a
domestic legal entity of foreign or alien jurisdiction. A company
wishing to redomesticate pursuant to this section shall provide evidence
that the applicable regulatory authority of its domicile consents to the
redomestication.
(c) An insurance company wishing to redomesticate under this
section shall file organizational documents with the secretary of state

(f) For the purposes of the financial examination required pursuant
to K.S.A. 40-4308, and amendments thereto, any examination
conducted by the foreign or alien domicile that is substantially similar
to an examination that would have been done in this state had the
company been domiciled in this state shall be recognized for the
purposes of establishing the period of time when the next examination
is due.
New Sec. 12. (a) The commissioner is hereby authorized to select
and announce the version of insurance calculations, instructions
promulgated by the NAIC or other documents required by the NAIC

Sec. 13. K.S.A. 40-112 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-

the payment of expenses incident thereto, there is hereby established
the insurance department service regulation fund in the state treasury,
which shall be administered by the commissioner of insurance. All
expenditures from the insurance department service regulation fund
shall be made in accordance with appropriation acts upon warrants of
the director of accounts and reports issued pursuant to vouchers
approved by the commissioner of insurance or by a person or persons
designated by the commissioner.
(b) On and after the effective date of this act January 1, 2026, all
fees received by the commissioner of insurance pursuant to any statute

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 8
and 1% of taxes received pursuant to K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments
thereto, shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with the
provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt
of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire
amount in the state treasury to the credit of the insurance department
service regulation fund.
(c) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the
commissioner of insurance shall make an annual assessment on each
group of affiliated insurers whose certificates of authority to do
business in this state are in good standing at the time of the assessment.
The total amount of all such assessments for a fiscal year shall be equal
to the amount sufficient whichthat, when combined with the total
amount to be credited to the insurance department service regulation
fund pursuant to subsection (b) is equal to the amount approved by the
legislature to fund the insurance company regulation program. With
respect to each group of affiliated insurers, such assessment shall be in
proportion to the amount of total assets of the group of affiliated
insurers as reported to the commissioner of insurance pursuant to
K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto, for the immediately preceding
calendar year, shall not be less than $500 and shall not be more than the
amount equal to .0000015 of the amount of total assets of the group of
affiliated insurers or $25,000, whichever is less. The total assessment
for any fiscal year shall not increase by any amount greater than 15% of
the total budget approved by the legislature to fund the insurance
company regulation program for the fiscal year immediately preceding
the fiscal year for which the assessment is made. In the event the total
amount of the assessment would be less than the aggregate amount
resulting by assessing the $500 minimum on each insurer, the
commissioner may establish a lower minimum to be assessed equally
on each insurer.
(d) If, by the laws of any state other than Kansas or by the
retaliatory laws of any state other than Kansas, any insurer domiciled in
Kansas shall be required to pay any fee or tax in such other state of
licensure, and the fee or tax is due and payable either because the
insurance department service regulation fee imposed by this section on
insurers licensed in Kansas and organized or domiciled in such other
state is greater than the comparable fee or tax assessed in such other
state, or such other state has no comparable fee or tax but requires
payment on a retaliatory basis, then to the extent such fee or tax
amounts are legally due and are paid in such other state, any insurer
domiciled in Kansas may claim a dollar-for-dollar credit for such fees
paid against insurer's annual premium taxes due the state of Kansas
under K.S.A. 40-252, and amendments thereto, or privilege fee due the
state of Kansas under K.S.A. 40-3213, and amendments thereto, but
such credit shall only be calculated on the amount which that would not
have been required to be paid in such other state of licensure in the
absence of the existence of the insurance department service regulation
fee imposed by this section, and in no event shall the credit permitted
by this section exceed 90% of the insurer's annual premium tax or
privilege fee due the state of Kansas. The insurance commissioner shall
prescribe the forms for reporting such credits.
(e) Assessments payable under this section shall be past due if not
paid to the insurance department within 45 days of the billing date of
such assessment. A penalty equal to 10% of the amount assessed shall
be imposed upon any past due payment and the total amount of the
assessment and penalty shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month
or any portion thereof.
(f) When there exists in the insurance department service
regulation fund a deficiency which that would render such fund
temporarily insufficient during any fiscal year to meet the insurance
department's funding requirements, the commissioner of insurance shall
certify the amount of the insufficiency. Upon receipt of any such
certification, the director of accounts and reports shall transfer an
amount of moneys equal to the amount so certified from the state

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 9
general fund to the insurance department service regulation fund. On
June 30 of any fiscal year during which an amount or amounts are
certified and transferred under this subsection, the director of accounts
and reports shall provide for the repayment of the amounts so
transferred and shall transfer the amount equal to the total of all such
amounts transferred during the fiscal year from the insurance
department service regulation fund to the state general fund.
(g) Any unexpended balance in the insurance department service
regulation fund at the close of a fiscal year shall remain credited to the
insurance department service regulation fund for use in the succeeding
fiscal year and shall be used to reduce future assessments or to
accommodate cash flow demands on the fund.
(h) The commissioner of insurance shall exempt the assessment of
any insurer which that, as of December 31 of the calendar year
preceding the assessment, has a surplus of less than two times the
minimum amount of surplus required for a certificate of authority on
and after May 1, 1994, and which is subject to the premium tax or
privilege fee liability imposed on insurers organized under the laws of
this state. The commissioner of insurance may also exempt or defer, in
whole or in part, the assessment of any other insurer if, in the opinion
of the commissioner of insurance, immediate payment of the total
assessment would be detrimental to the solvency of the insurer.

and that is a member of an insurance holding company system shall
register with the commissioner of insurance, except a foreign insurer
subject to registration requirements and standards adopted by statute or
regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile that are substantially
similar to those contained in this section. Any insurer that is subject to
registration under this section shall register within 15 days after it
becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter by May 1 of
each year unless for the previous calendar year the commissioner of
insurance for good cause shown extends the time for registration, and
then within such extended time. The commissioner of insurance may
require any authorized insurer that is a member of an insurance holding
company system and that is not subject to registration under this
section to furnish a copy of the registration statement, the summary
specified in subsection (c) or other information filed by such insurance
company with the insurance regulatory authority of domiciliary
jurisdiction.
(b) Pursuant to subsection (a), every insurer subject to registration

act of 1933, as amended, or the securities exchange act of 1934, as

statements that have been filed with the SEC;
(7) statements that the insurer's board of directors and principal
officers oversee corporate governance and internal controls and that the

insurance by rules and regulations.
(c) All registration statements shall be accompanied by a summary
outlining all items in the current registration statement representing
changes from the prior registration statement.
(d) No information need be disclosed on the registration statement
filed pursuant to subsection (b) if such information is not material for
the purpose of this section. Unless the commissioner of insurance by
rules and regulations or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases,
exchanges, loans or extensions of credit, investments or guarantees,
involving 0.5% or less of an insurer's admitted assets as of the
December 31 immediately next preceding shall be deemed immaterial
for purposes of this section.
(e) Each registered insurer shall keep current the information
required to be disclosed in such insurer's registration statement by
reporting all material changes or additions on amendment forms
provided by the commissioner of insurance within 15 days after the end
of the month in which it learns of each such change or addition, except
that each registered insurer shall report all dividends and other
distributions to shareholders within five business days following its
declaration. Any such dividend or distribution shall not be paid for at
least 10 business days from the commissioner's receipt of the notice of
its declaration.
(f) Any person within an insurance holding company system

holding company system to register on behalf of any affiliated insurer
that is required to register under subsection (a) and to file all

holding company system. The disclaimer shall fully disclose all

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 21
material relationships and bases for affiliation between such person and
such insurer as well as the basis for disclaiming such affiliation. After a
disclaimer has been filed, the insurer shall be relieved of any duty to
register or report under this section which that may arise out of the
insurer's relationship with such person unless and until the
commissioner of insurance disallows such a disclaimer. The
commissioner of insurance shall disallow such a disclaimer only after
furnishing all parties in interest with notice and opportunity to be heard
in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas administrative
procedure act.
(l) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the ultimate
controlling person of every insurer subject to registration also shall file
an annual enterprise risk report. The report, to the best of the ultimate
controlling person's knowledge and belief, shall identify the material
risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose
enterprise risk to the insurer. The report shall be appropriate to the
nature, scale and complexity of the insurer. The report shall be filed
with the lead state commissioner of insurance of the insurance holding
company system as determined by the procedures within the financial
analysis handbook adopted by the national association of insurance
commissioners NAIC. The first enterprise risk report shall be filed no
not later than May 1, 2015, and annually thereafter by May 1 of each
year unless the commissioner of insurance extends the time for filing
for good cause shown.
(2) The ultimate controlling person of a domestic insurer that is
authorized, admitted or eligible to engage in the business of insurance
only in this state with total direct and assumed annual premiums of less
than $300 million is not required to submit an enterprise risk report
under paragraph (1) unless the ultimate controlling person of the
domestic insurer also controls other insurers that do not meet the
requirements of this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, an
insurer is not considered to be authorized, admitted or eligible to
engage in the business of insurance only in this state if the insurer
directly or indirectly writes or assumes insurance in any other manner
in another state (A) Except as provided hereunder, the ultimate
controlling person of every insurer subject to registration shall
concurrently file with the registration an annual group capital
calculation as directed by the lead state commissioner. The report shall
be completed in accordance with the NAIC group capital calculation
instructions, which may permit the lead state commissioner to allow a
controlling person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the
group capital calculation. The report shall be filed with the lead state
commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined
by the commissioner of insurance in accordance with the procedures
within the financial analysis handbook. An insurance holding company
system shall be exempt from filing the group capital calculation if:
(i) It has only one insurer within its holding company structure,
only writes business is only licensed in its domestic state and assumes
no business from any other insurer;
(ii) it is required to perform a group capital calculation specified
by the board of governors of the federal reserve system. The lead state
commissioner shall request the calculation from the federal reserve
board under the terms of information sharing agreements in effect. If
the federal reserve board cannot share the calculation with the lead
state commissioner, the insurance holding company shall not be exempt
from the group capital calculation filing;
(iii) its non-United States group-wide supervisor is located within
a reciprocal jurisdiction, as defined in K.S.A. 40-221a, and
amendments thereto, that recognizes the United States regulatory
approach to group supervision and group capital; and
(iv) it is an insurance holding company system:
(a) That provides information to the lead state that meets the
requirements for accreditation under the NAIC financial standards and
accreditation program, either directly or indirectly through the group-

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 22
wide supervisor, who has determined that such information is
satisfactory to allow the lead state to comply with the NAIC group
supervision approach, as detailed in the NAIC financial analysis
handbook; and
(b) whose non-United States group-wide supervisor who is not in
a reciprocal jurisdiction recognizes and accepts, as specified by the
commissioner in rules and regulations, the group capital calculation as
the worldwide group capital assessment for United States insurance
groups that operate in that jurisdiction.
(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of K.S.A. 40-3305, and
amendments thereto, a lead state commissioner shall require the group
capital calculation for the United States operations of any non-United
States based insurance holding company system if, after any necessary
consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed
appropriate by the lead state commissioner for prudential oversight
and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness
of the insurance marketplace.
(C) Notwithstanding the exemptions from filing the group capital
calculation stated in K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, the lead
state commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate
controlling person from filing the annual group capital calculation or
to accept a limited group capital filing or report in accordance with
criteria specified by the commissioner in regulation.
(D) If the lead state commissioner determines that an insurance
holding company system no longer meets one or more of the
requirements for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation
under this section, the insurance holding company system shall file the
group capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an
extension by the lead state commissioner based on reasonable grounds
shown.
(E) The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to
registration and also scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test
framework shall file the results of a specific year's liquidity stress test.
The filing shall be made to the lead state insurance commissioner of
the insurance holding company system as determined by the
procedures within the financial analysis handbook and that:
(i) The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope
criteria applicable to a specific data year. These scope criteria are
reviewed at least annually by the financial stability task force or its
successor. Any change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to
the data year for which the scope criteria are to be measured shall be
effective on January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which
such changes are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of
the scope criteria are considered scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress
test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state
insurance commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial
stability task force or its successor, determines that such insurer should
not be scoped into the framework for that data year. Similarly, insurers
that do not trigger at least one threshold of the scope criteria are
considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for
the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance commissioner,
in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its
successor, determines that the insurer should be scoped into the
framework for that data year.
(ii) The lead state insurance commissioner, in consultation with
the financial stability task force or its successor, shall assess the
concerns of regulators that wish to avoid having insurers scoped in and
out of the NAIC liquidity stress test framework on a frequent basis as
part of the determination for an insurer.
(F) The performance and filing of the results of a specific year's
liquidity stress test shall comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test
framework instructions and reporting templates for that year and any
lead state insurance commissioner determinations, in consultation with
the financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 23
framework.
(m) The failure of an insurer or an ultimate controlling person of
the insurer to file a registration statement, any summary of the
registration statement or enterprise risk filing within the specified time
for filing shall be a violation by the insurer or by the ultimate
controlling person of the insurer, as applicable.
Sec. 21. K.S.A. 40-3306 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
3306. (a) Material Transactions by registered insurers with their
affiliates shall be subject to the following standards:
(1) The terms shall be fair and reasonable;
(2) agreements for cost-sharing services and management shall
include such provisions as required by rules and regulations adopted by
the commissioner of insurance;
(3) the charges or fees for services performed shall be reasonable;
(4) expenses incurred and payment received with respect to such
transactions shall be allocated to the insurer in conformity with the
requirements of K.S.A. 40-225, and amendments thereto;
(5) the books, accounts and records of each party to all such
transactions shall be so maintained as to clearly and accurately disclose
the nature and details of the transactions including such accounting
information necessary to support the reasonableness of the charges or
fees to the respective parties; and
(6) the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any
transactions, dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates shall be
reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and
adequate to its financial needs.
(b) (1) If an insurer subject to this act is deemed by the
commissioner of insurance to be in a hazardous financial condition as
defined by K.S.A. 40-222d, and amendments thereto, or a condition
that would be grounds for supervision, conservation or a delinquency
proceeding, then the commissioner may require the insurer to secure
and maintain either a deposit, held by the commissioner, or a bond, as
determined by the insurer at the insurer's discretion, for the protection
of the insurer for the duration of the contract or agreement or the
existence of the condition for which the commissioner required the
deposit or the bond.
(2) In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the
commissioner shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the
affiliated person's ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the
insurer were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to
be in a hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be
grounds for supervision, conservation or a delinquency proceeding and
a deposit or bond is necessary, the commissioner shall have the
discretion to determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to
exceed the value of the contract or agreement in any one year, and
whether such deposit or bond should be required for a single contract,
multiple contracts or a contract only with a specific person;
(c) All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and
shall remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the
insurer, are identifiable and are segregated or readily capable of
segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer from all other persons'
records and data. All records and data that are otherwise the property
of the insurer, in whatever form maintained, including, but not limited
to, claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation
files, premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel
records, financial records or similar records within the possession,
custody or control of the affiliate shall remain the property of the
insurer. At the request of the insurer, the affiliate shall provide that the
receiver may obtain a complete set of all records of any type that
pertain to the insurer's business, obtain access to the operating systems
upon which the data is maintained, obtain the software that runs those
systems either through assumption of licensing agreements or
otherwise and restrict the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not
operating the insurer's business. The affiliate shall provide a waiver of

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 24
any landlord lien or other encumbrance to provide the insurer with
access to all records and data in the event of the affiliate's default
under a lease or other agreement; and
(d) Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are
collected or held by an affiliate shall be deemed the exclusive property
of and subject to the control of such insurer. Any right of offset in the
event that an insurer is placed into receivership shall be subject to
K.S.A. 40-3605 et seq., and amendments thereto.
(b)(e) The following transactions involving a domestic insurer and
any person in such insurer's insurance holding company system,
including amendments or modifications of affiliate agreements
previously filed pursuant to this section, may not be entered into unless
the insurer has notified the commissioner of insurance in writing of
such insurer's intention to enter into such transaction at least 30 days
prior thereto, or such shorter period as the commissioner of insurance
may permit, and the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved
such transaction within such period.
(1) Sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or extensions of credit,
guarantees or investments provided such transactions are equal to or
exceed:
(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the
insurer's admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders; or
(B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted
assets, each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
(2) Loans or extensions of credit to any person who is not an
affiliate, where if the insurer makes such loans or extensions of credit
with the agreement or understanding that the proceeds of such
transactions, in whole or in substantial part, are to be used to make
loans or extensions of credit to, purchase assets of, or make
investments in, any affiliate of the insurer making such loans or
extensions of credit provided if such transactions are equal to or
exceed:
(A) With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of 3% of the
insurer's admitted assets or 25% of surplus as regards policyholders;
(B) with respect to life insurers, 3% of the insurer's admitted
assets, each as of December 31 immediately preceding.
(3) Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including:
(A) All reinsurance pooling agreements; and
(B) agreements in which the reinsurance premium or a change in
the insurer's liabilities, or the projected reinsurance premium or a
projected change in the insurer's liabilities in any of the next three
consecutive years equals or exceeds 5% of the insurer's surplus as
regards policyholders, as of December 31 immediately preceding,
including those agreements which that may require as consideration the
transfer of assets from an insurer to a nonaffiliate, if an agreement or
understanding exists between the insurer and nonaffiliate that any
portion of such assets will be transferred to one or more affiliates of the
insurer;
(4) all management agreements, service contracts, tax allocation
agreements and all cost-sharing arrangements; and
(5) any material transactions, specified by rules and regulations,
which that the commissioner of insurance determines may adversely
affect the interests of an insurer's policyholders.
Nothing herein contained in this subsection shall be deemed to
authorize or permit any transactions which, that in the case of an
insurer not a member of the same insurance holding company system,
would be otherwise contrary to law.
(c)(f) A domestic insurer may shall not enter into transactions
which that are part of a plan or series of like transactions with persons
within the insurance holding company system if the purpose of those
separate transactions is to avoid the threshold amount required under
this section and thus avoid the review that would occur otherwise. If the
commissioner of insurance determines that such separate transactions
were entered into over any 12-month period for such purpose, the

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 25
commissioner of insurance may exercise authority under K.S.A. 40-
3311, and amendments thereto.
(d)(g) The commissioner of insurance, in reviewing transactions
pursuant to subsection (b)(e), shall consider whether the transactions
comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a), and whether such
transactions may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.
(e)(h) The commissioner of insurance shall be notified within 30
days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation
if the total investment in such corporation by the insurance holding
company system exceeds 10% of such corporation's voting securities.
(f)(i) A transaction subject to approval by the commissioner of
insurance pursuant to K.S.A. 40-3304, and amendments thereto, shall
not be subject to the requirements of this section.
(g)(j) (1) No insurer subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305,
and amendments thereto, shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make
any other extraordinary distribution to such insurer's shareholders until:
(A) 30 days after the commissioner of insurance has received
notice of the declaration thereof and has not within such period
disapproved such payment; or
(B) the commissioner of insurance has approved such payment
within such 30-day period.
(2) (A) For purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or
distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other
property, the fair market value of which, together with that of other
dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months,
exceeds the greater of:
(i) 10% of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of
December 31 immediately preceding; or
(ii) the net gain from operations of such insurer, if such insurer is a
life insurer, or the net income, if such insurer is not a life insurer, not
including realized capital gains for the 12-month period ending
December 31 immediately next preceding, but shall not include pro rata
distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.
(B) In determining whether a dividend or distribution is
extraordinary, an insurer, other than a life insurer, may carry forward
net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already
been paid out as dividends. This carry-forward carryforward shall be
computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding
calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid
in the second and immediately preceding calendar years.
(C) An extraordinary dividend or distribution shall also include
any dividend or distribution made or paid out of any funds other than
earned surplus arising from the insurer's business, as defined in K.S.A.
40-233, and amendments thereto. The provisions of K.S.A. 40-233, and
amendments thereto, shall not be construed so as to prohibit an insurer,
subject to registration under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto,
from making or paying an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
accordance with this section.
(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may
declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which that is
conditional upon the approval of the commissioner of insurance. No
declaration shall confer any rights upon shareholders until:
(A) The commissioner of insurance has approved the payment of
such dividend or distribution; or
(B) the commissioner of insurance has not disapproved such
payment within the 30-day period referred to above.
(h)(k) (1) Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by
any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be
relieved of any obligation or liability to which they would otherwise be
subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its
separate operating identity consistent with this act.
(2) Nothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having
or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of
personnel, property or services with one or more other persons under

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 26
arrangements meeting the standards of K.S.A. 40-3306, and
amendments thereto.
(i) For purposes of this act, in determining whether an insurer's
surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's
outstanding liabilities and adequate to such insurer's financial needs,
the following factors, among others, shall be considered:
(1) The size of the insurer as measured by such insurer's assets,
capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and
other appropriate criteria;
(2) the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among
the several lines of insurance;
(3) the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;
(4) the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's
insured risks;
(5) the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;
(6) the quality, diversification and liquidity of the insurer's
investment portfolio;
(7) the recent past and projected future trend in the size and
performance of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders;
(8) the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other
comparable insurers;
(9) the adequacy of the insurer's reserves;
(10) the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates. The
commissioner of insurance may treat any such investment as a
disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as
regards policyholders whenever in the judgment of the commissioner
of insurance such investment so warrants; and
(11) the quality of the insurer's earnings and the extent to which
the reported earnings include extraordinary items.
Sec. 22. K.S.A. 40-3307 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
3307. (a) Subject to the limitation contained in this section and in
addition to the powers which that the commissioner of insurance has
under K.S.A. 40-222 and K.S.A. 40-222a, and amendments thereto,
relating to the examination of insurers, the commissioner of insurance
shall have the power to examine any insurer registered under K.S.A.
40-3305, and amendments thereto, and such insurer's affiliates to
ascertain the financial condition, including enterprise risk, of such
insurer including the enterprise risk to the insurer by the ultimate
controlling party or by any entity or combination of entities within the
insurance holding company system or by the insurance holding
company system on a consolidated basis.
(b) (1) The commissioner of insurance may order any insurer
registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and amendments thereto, to produce
such records, books or other information in the possession of the
insurer or its affiliates as are reasonably necessary to determine
compliance with this act.
(2) To determine compliance with this act, the commissioner of
insurance may order any insurer registered under K.S.A. 40-3305, and
amendments thereto, to produce information not in the possession of
the insurer, if the insurer can obtain access to such information pursuant
to contractual relationships, statutory obligations or another method. In
the event that the insurer cannot obtain the information requested by
the commissioner of insurance, the insurer shall provide the
commissioner of insurance a detailed explanation of the reason that the
insurer cannot obtain the information and the identity of the holder of
information. Whenever it appears to the commissioner of insurance that
the detailed explanation is without merit, the commissioner of
insurance may require, after notice and hearing, the insurer to pay a
penalty of not more than $1,000 for each day's delay, or may suspend
or revoke the license of the insurer.
(c) The commissioner of insurance may retain at the registered
insurer's expense such attorneys, actuaries, accountants and other
experts not otherwise a part of the staff of the commissioner of
insurance as the commissioner of insurance shall determine to be

HOUSE BILL No. 2334—page 27
reasonably necessary to assist in the conduct of the examination under
subsection (a). Any persons so retained shall be under the direction and
control of the commissioner of insurance and shall act in a purely
advisory capacity.
(d) Each registered insurer producing examination records, books
and papers pursuant to subsection (a) shall be liable for and shall pay
the expense of such examination in accordance with K.S.A. 40-223 and
K.S.A. 40-253, and amendments thereto.
(e) The commissioner of insurance shall have the power to issue
subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person for
purposes of determining compliance with this section. Upon the failure
or refusal of any person to obey a subpoena, the commissioner of
insurance may petition a court of competent jurisdiction, and upon
proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to
appear and testify or produce documentary evidence. Failure to obey
the court order shall be punishable as contempt of court. Every person
subpoenaed shall be obliged to attend as a witness at the place specified
in the subpoena, when subpoenaed, anywhere within the state. Such
subpoenaed person shall be entitled to the same fees and mileage, if
claimed, as a witness in K.S.A. 28-125, and amendments thereto. Fees,
mileage and actual expense, if any, necessarily incurred in securing the
