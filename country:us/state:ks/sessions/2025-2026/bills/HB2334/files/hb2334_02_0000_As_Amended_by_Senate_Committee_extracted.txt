14 protected cell captive insurance company with respect to each protected
15 cell. A plan of operation includes, but is not limited to, the specific
16 business objectives and investment guidelines of the protected cell, except
17 that the commissioner may require additional information in the plan of

40 cell;
41 (5) an incorporated protected cell may be organized and operated in
42 any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
43 including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability
HB 2334—Am. by SC 4
1 company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company
2 act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell captive insurer
3 shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this act and shall have
4 the power to enter into contracts, including an individual series of a limited
5 liability company. Unless otherwise permitted by the organizational
6 documents of a protected cell captive insurer, each incorporated protected
7 cell of the protected cell captive insurer shall have the same directors,
8 secretary and registered office as the protected cell captive insurer; and
9 (6) all attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell

14 company's general account and its protected cells. Any attribution of assets
15 and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell shall be in
16 cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.
17 (b) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to
18 such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell captive
19 insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated cell.
20 Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including assets
21 transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned by the
22 protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall be, or
23 represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of
24 such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
25 subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may allow for a
26 security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell
27 account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise
28 allowed under applicable law.
29 (c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
30 captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an
31 investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or other third party to
32 manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
33 expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager are
34 payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not from
35 the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
36 protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
37 (d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
38 administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify
39 the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive insurance
40 company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
41 attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell captive
42 insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell
43 liabilities:
HB 2334—Am. by SC 5
1 (A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities
2 of the protected cell captive insurance company's general account; and
3 (B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
4 identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
5 attributable to other protected cells.
6 (2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
7 applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
8 assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
9 insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not be
10 construed as an exclusive remedy.
11 (e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
12 insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value that is
13 at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to
14 such protected cell.
15 (f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the books
16 and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to reflect the
17 financial condition and results of operations of such protected cell, net
18 income or loss, dividends or other distributions to participants and such
19 other factors as may be provided in the participant contract or required by
20 the commissioner.
21 (g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
22 arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell captive
23 insurance company may conduct.
24 (h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
25 such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any of
26 its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
27 (i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution shall
28 be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive insurance
29 company or participant without the commissioner's approval. In no event
30 shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale, exchange, transfer,
31 dividend or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment of a
32 protected cell.
33 (j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells and
34 the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
35 approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets or liabilities
36 shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance company between its
37 general account and any protected cell or between any protected cells. The
38 protected cell captive insurance company shall attribute all insurance
39 obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a reinsurance contract entered
40 into with respect to a protected cell to such protected cell. The
41 performance under such reinsurance contract and any tax benefits, losses,
42 refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax allocation agreement to which
43 the protected cell captive insurance company is a party, including any
HB 2334—Am. by SC 6
1 payments made by or due to be made to the protected cell captive
2 insurance company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, shall reflect
3 the insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to the reinsurance
4 contract that are attributed to such protected cell.
5 (k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation
6 of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets and liabilities of a
7 protected cell shall, to the extent that the commissioner determines that
8 such assets and liabilities are separable, at all times be kept separate from
9 and shall not be commingled with those of other protected cells and the
10 protected cell captive insurance company.
11 (l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually file
12 with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
13 commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without limitation,
14 accounting statements detailing the financial experience of each protected
15 cell.
16 (m) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall notify the
17 commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell that
18 is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense obligations.
19 (n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
20 commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new protected
21 cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of any existing
22 protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of operation requiring
23 the commissioner's prior written approval.
24 (o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
25 company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
26 (1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any
27 state;
28 (2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state; or
29 (3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
30 policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or
31 other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The amount of
32 security provided shall be not less than the reserves associated with those
33 liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured, including reserves for
34 losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
35 and unearned premiums for business written through the participant's
36 protected cell. The commissioner may require the protected cell captive
37 insurance company to increase the funding of any security arrangement
38 established under this subsection. If the form of security is a letter of
39 credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved
40 by the commissioner. A trust maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
41 be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the
42 commissioner.
43 (p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in addition
HB 2334—Am. by SC 7
1 to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
2 amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected cell
3 captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines that one
4 or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may separate
5 such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company and may
6 allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance company, for
7 the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing
8 protected cell captive insurance companies or one or more other captive
9 insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of operation as the

19 (d) Unless specified by the plan of operation, participant contract or
20 other prior contractual agreement, the assets of one protected cell may not

28 protected cell shall have standing to appear and petition for any
29 appropriate relief to protect the confidentiality of its papers or documents.

31 insurance company, one of its protected cells may be converted to any

23 approval by the commissioner and the filing of amended organizational
24 documents with the secretary of state, the captive insurance company shall
25 be issued a revised certificate of authority. The effective date of the revised
26 protected cell captive insurance company's certificate of authority shall

30 officer having jurisdiction over the regulation of insurance in another state,
31 provided that:
32 (A) Such public official shall agree in writing to maintain the
33 confidentiality of such information; and

39 writing prior to receiving the information to provide to it the same
40 confidential treatment as required by this section, unless the company
41 gives prior written consent; and
42 (4) the privacy of those who have established an affiliated fidfin trust

5 petitions relevant to trust administration and all court orders thereon shall
6 be sealed upon filing and shall not be made a part of the public record of
7 the proceeding, except that such petition shall be available to the court, the
8 trustor, the trustee, the custodian, any beneficiary, their attorneys and to
9 such other interested persons as the court may order upon a showing of
10 good cause.
11 Sec. 12. K.S.A. 40-4304 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-

39 Sec. 13. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-4308 is hereby amended to read as
40 follows: 40-4308. (a) Whenever the commissioner deems necessary, but at

42 be made, a financial examination of any captive insurance company in the
43 process of organization or applying for admission or doing business in
HB 2334—Am. by SC 15
1 Kansas. The commissioner may engage in continuous analysis for the
2 preparation of the examination. In addition, at the commissioner's
3 discretion, the commissioner may make, or direct to be made, a market
4 regulation examination of any insurance company doing business in
5 Kansas.
6 (b) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of
7 examinations of financial condition, the commissioner shall consider such
8 matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in
9 management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent
10 certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's
11 handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners
12 in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this subsection.
13 (c) The commissioner shall have free access to the books and papers
14 of any such company that relate to its business and to the books and papers

17 agents or employees of any such company in relation to its affairs,
18 transactions and condition.
19 (d) For the purpose of such analysis, the commissioner may require
20 reports and other documents be filed with the commissioner.
21 (e) The commissioner may also examine or investigate any person, or
22 the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is,
23 in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the
24 examination of the company, but such examination or investigation shall
25 not infringe upon or extend to any communications or information
26 accorded privileged or confidential status under any other laws of this
27 state.
28 (f) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the
29 commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall appoint one or more
30 examiners to perform the examination and instruct such examiners as to

34 may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent
35 certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as

6 review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and
7 any relevant portions of the examiners' workpapers, and enter an order:
8 (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or
9 corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating
10 in violation of any law, rule and regulation or prior order of the
11 commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any
12 action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure such
13 violations;
14 (B) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners
15 to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data,
16 documentation or information; or
17 (C) call for and conduct a fact-finding hearing in accordance with
18 K.S.A. 40-281, and amendments thereto, for purposes of obtaining
19 additional documentation, data, information and testimony.
20 (3) All orders entered as a result of revelations contained in the final
21 examination report shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions

24 submissions or rebuttals. Within 30 days of the issuance of the adopted
25 report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors
26 stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and
27 related orders.
28 (4) Upon the adoption of the examination report of an association
29 captive insurance company, the commissioner shall hold the content of the
30 examination report as private and confidential as to the pure captive
31 insurance company. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to
32 limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make
33 public any final or preliminary examination report in the furtherance of
34 any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the
35 commissioner's discretion, deem appropriate.
36 (i) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the
37 commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order
38 to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of
39 this state.
40 (j) All examination reports, preliminary examination reports or
41 results, working papers, recorded information, documents and copies
42 thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any
43 other person in the course of an examination made under this section are
HB 2334—Am. by SC 17
1 confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public

7 New Sec. 5. A protected cell captive insurance company formed or
8 licensed under this chapter may establish and maintain one or more
9 incorporated or unincorporated protected cells to insure risks of one or
10 more participants, subject to the following conditions:
11 (a) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company may establish one
12 or more protected cells if the commissioner has approved in writing a plan
13 of operation or amendments to a plan of operation submitted by the
14 protected cell captive insurance company with respect to each protected
15 cell. A plan of operation includes, but is not limited to, the specific
16 business objectives and investment guidelines of the protected cell, except
17 that the commissioner may require additional information in the plan of
18 operation. The commissioner may put into effect a plan of operation or
19 amendments to a plan of operation on or before the date that the approval
20 is signed if the effective date is not earlier than the date that the plan of
21 operation or amendments to the plan of operation were filed with the
22 department;
23 (2) upon the commissioner's written approval of the plan of operation,
24 the protected cell captive insurance company, in accordance with the
25 approved plan of operation, may attribute insurance obligations with
26 respect to its insurance business to the protected cell;
27 (3) a protected cell shall have its own distinct name or designation
28 that shall include the words "protected cell" or "incorporated cell." An
29 incorporated cell formed as a series of a limited liability company shall
30 bear a distinct name or designation as reflected in its formation documents
31 and include the words "series cell." Such names or designations may also
32 be reasonably abbreviated, including, without limitation, pc or p.c. for
33 "protected cell," ic, i.c., ipc, or i.p.c. for "incorporated cell" and sc, s.c.,
34 spc or s.p.c. for "series cell";
35 (4) the protected cell captive insurance company shall transfer all
36 assets attributable to a protected cell to one or more separately established
37 and identified protected cell accounts bearing the name or designation of
38 such protected cell. Protected cell assets shall be held in the protected cell
39 accounts for the purpose of satisfying the obligations of such protected
40 cell;
41 (5) an incorporated protected cell may be organized and operated in
42 any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
43 including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability

HB 2334—Am. by SC 4
1 company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company
2 act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell captive insurer
3 shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this act and shall have
4 the power to enter into contracts, including an individual series of a limited
5 liability company. Unless otherwise permitted by the organizational
6 documents of a protected cell captive insurer, each incorporated protected
7 cell of the protected cell captive insurer shall have the same directors,
8 secretary and registered office as the protected cell captive insurer; and
9 (6) all attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell
10 and the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
11 and participant contracts approved by the commissioner. No other
12 attribution of assets or liabilities shall be made by a protected cell captive
13 insurance company between the protected cell captive insurance
14 company's general account and its protected cells. Any attribution of assets
15 and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell shall be in
16 cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.
17 (b) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to
18 such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell captive
19 insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated cell.
20 Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including assets
21 transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned by the
22 protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall be, or
23 represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of
24 such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
25 subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may allow for a
26 security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell
27 account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise
28 allowed under applicable law.
29 (c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
30 captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an
31 investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or other third party to
32 manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
33 expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager are
34 payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not from
35 the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
36 protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
37 (d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
38 administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify
39 the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive insurance
40 company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
41 attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell captive
42 insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell
43 liabilities:

HB 2334—Am. by SC 5
1 (A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities
2 of the protected cell captive insurance company's general account; and
3 (B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
4 identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
5 attributable to other protected cells.
6 (2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
7 applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
8 assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
9 insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not be
10 construed as an exclusive remedy.
11 (e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
12 insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value that is
13 at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to
14 such protected cell.
15 (f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the books
16 and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to reflect the
17 financial condition and results of operations of such protected cell, net
18 income or loss, dividends or other distributions to participants and such
19 other factors as may be provided in the participant contract or required by
20 the commissioner.
21 (g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
22 arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell captive
23 insurance company may conduct.
24 (h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
25 such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any of
26 its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
27 (i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution shall
28 be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive insurance
29 company or participant without the commissioner's approval. In no event
30 shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale, exchange, transfer,
31 dividend or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment of a
32 protected cell.
33 (j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells and
34 the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
35 approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets or liabilities
36 shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance company between its
37 general account and any protected cell or between any protected cells. The
38 protected cell captive insurance company shall attribute all insurance
39 obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a reinsurance contract entered
40 into with respect to a protected cell to such protected cell. The
41 performance under such reinsurance contract and any tax benefits, losses,
42 refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax allocation agreement to which
43 the protected cell captive insurance company is a party, including any

HB 2334—Am. by SC 6
1 payments made by or due to be made to the protected cell captive
2 insurance company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, shall reflect
3 the insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to the reinsurance
4 contract that are attributed to such protected cell.
5 (k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation
6 of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets and liabilities of a
7 protected cell shall, to the extent that the commissioner determines that
8 such assets and liabilities are separable, at all times be kept separate from
9 and shall not be commingled with those of other protected cells and the
10 protected cell captive insurance company.
11 (l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually file
12 with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
13 commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without limitation,
14 accounting statements detailing the financial experience of each protected
15 cell.
16 (m) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall notify the
17 commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell that
18 is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense obligations.
19 (n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
20 commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new protected
21 cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of any existing
22 protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of operation requiring
23 the commissioner's prior written approval.
24 (o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
25 company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
26 (1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any
27 state;
28 (2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state; or
29 (3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
30 policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or
31 other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The amount of
32 security provided shall be not less than the reserves associated with those
33 liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured, including reserves for
34 losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
35 and unearned premiums for business written through the participant's
36 protected cell. The commissioner may require the protected cell captive
37 insurance company to increase the funding of any security arrangement
38 established under this subsection. If the form of security is a letter of
39 credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved
40 by the commissioner. A trust maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
41 be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the
42 commissioner.
43 (p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in addition

HB 2334—Am. by SC 7
1 to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
2 amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected cell
3 captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines that one
4 or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may separate
5 such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company and may
6 allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance company, for
7 the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing
8 protected cell captive insurance companies or one or more other captive
9 insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of operation as the
10 commissioner deems acceptable.
11 (q) Biographical affidavits shall not be required for participants in
12 unincorporated cells. Biographical affidavits shall be required for owners
13 of incorporated cells, including series members of a series LLC.

15 under this act may establish and operate unincorporated and incorporated
16 protected cells.

28 New Sec. 7. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4, and
29 amendments thereto, the assets of two or more protected cells may be
30 combined for purposes of investment, and such combination shall not be
31 construed as defeating the segregation of such assets for accounting or
32 other purposes.
33 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, the commissioner
34 may approve the use of alternative reliable methods of valuation and
35 rating.

11 pleadings as if it were a protected cell.
12 (b) A legal action brought against a protected cell captive insurance
13 company that does not specify one or more protected cells shall be deemed
14 to have been brought against the general account only.
15 (c) Any protected cell that is not named in the pleadings of the legal
16 action shall not be deemed to be a party to the legal action. Any protected
17 cell that is erroneously named as a party or named without proper cause
18 shall be entitled to prompt dismissal from the legal action.
19 (d) Unless specified by the plan of operation, participant contract or
20 other prior contractual agreement, the assets of one protected cell may not
21 be encumbered or seized to satisfy the obligations of or a judgment against
22 any other protected cell. No protected cell shall have a duty to defend the
23 rights and obligations of any other protected cell.
24 (e) In any legal action involving a protected cell captive insurance
25 company or a protected cell, any papers, documents or property of a
26 nonparty protected cell shall be afforded the same status during discovery
27 as the documents or property of any other unrelated third party. A nonparty
28 protected cell shall have standing to appear and petition for any
29 appropriate relief to protect the confidentiality of its papers or documents.
30 New Sec. 10. (a) (1) Upon the application of a protected cell captive
31 insurance company, one of its protected cells may be converted to any
32 form of captive insurance company authorized pursuant to chapter 40 of
33 the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, with the consent

20 (b) A captive insurance company may apply to the commissioner for
21 conversion to become a protected cell captive insurance company under

23 approval by the commissioner and the filing of amended organizational
24 documents with the secretary of state, the captive insurance company shall
25 be issued a revised certificate of authority. The effective date of the revised
26 protected cell captive insurance company's certificate of authority shall

43 process of organization or applying for admission or doing business in

HB 2334—Am. by SC 15

2 preparation of the examination. In addition, at the commissioner's
3 discretion, the commissioner may make, or direct to be made, a market
4 regulation examination of any insurance company doing business in
5 Kansas.
6 (b) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of
7 examinations of financial condition, the commissioner shall consider such
8 matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in
9 management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent

17 agents or employees of any such company in relation to its affairs,
18 transactions and condition.
19 (d) For the purpose of such analysis, the commissioner may require
20 reports and other documents be filed with the commissioner.
21 (e) The commissioner may also examine or investigate any person, or
22 the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is,
23 in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the
24 examination of the company, but such examination or investigation shall
25 not infringe upon or extend to any communications or information
26 accorded privileged or confidential status under any other laws of this
27 state.
28 (f) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the
29 commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall appoint one or more

32 other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
33 (g) When making an examination under this act, the commissioner
34 may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent
35 certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as

37 is the subject of the examination.
38 (h) (1) Not later than 30 days following completion of the
39 examination or at such earlier time as the commissioner shall prescribe,
40 the examiner in charge shall file with the deparment a verified written
41 report of examination under oath. Not later than 30 days following receipt
42 of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the

2 written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the
3 examination report.
4 (2) Within 30 days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of
5 written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and
6 review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and
7 any relevant portions of the examiners' workpapers, and enter an order:
8 (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or
9 corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating
10 in violation of any law, rule and regulation or prior order of the
11 commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any
12 action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure such
13 violations;
14 (B) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners
15 to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data,
16 documentation or information; or
17 (C) call for and conduct a fact-finding hearing in accordance with
18 K.S.A. 40-281, and amendments thereto, for purposes of obtaining
19 additional documentation, data, information and testimony.
20 (3) All orders entered as a result of revelations contained in the final
21 examination report shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions

23 examination report, relevant examiner work papers and any written
24 submissions or rebuttals. Within 30 days of the issuance of the adopted
25 report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors
26 stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and
27 related orders.
28 (4) Upon the adoption of the examination report of an association
29 captive insurance company, the commissioner shall hold the content of the
30 examination report as private and confidential as to the pure captive
31 insurance company. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to
32 limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make
33 public any final or preliminary examination report in the furtherance of
34 any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the
35 commissioner's discretion, deem appropriate.
36 (i) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the
37 commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order
38 to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of
39 this state.
40 (j) All examination reports, preliminary examination reports or
41 results, working papers, recorded information, documents and copies
42 thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any

1 confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public
2 by the commissioner or an employee or agent of the commissioner without
3 the written consent of the company, except to the extent provided in this
4 subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the commissioner
5 from using such information in furtherance of the commissioner's
6 regulatory authority under this act. The commissioner may grant access to
