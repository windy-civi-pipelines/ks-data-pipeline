40 any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
41 including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability
42 company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company
43 act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell captive insurer
HB 2334 4
1 shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this act and shall have
2 the power to enter into contracts, including an individual series of a limited
3 liability company. Unless otherwise permitted by the organizational
4 documents of a protected cell captive insurer, each incorporated protected
5 cell of the protected cell captive insurer shall have the same directors,

13 and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell shall be in
14 cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.

16 such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell captive
17 insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated cell.
18 Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including assets
19 transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned by the
20 protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall be, or
21 represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of
22 such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
23 subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may allow for a
24 security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell
25 account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise
26 allowed under applicable law.
27 (c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
28 captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an

30 manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
31 expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager are
32 payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not from
33 the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
34 protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
35 (d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
36 administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify
37 the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive insurance
38 company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
39 attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell captive
40 insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell
41 liabilities:
42 (A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities
43 of the protected cell captive insurance company's general account; and
HB 2334 5
1 (B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
2 identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
3 attributable to other protected cells.
4 (2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
5 applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
6 assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
7 insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not be
8 construed as an exclusive remedy.
9 (e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
10 insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value that is
11 at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to
12 such protected cell.
13 (f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the books
14 and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to reflect the
15 financial condition and results of operations of such protected cell, net
16 income or loss, dividends or other distributions to participants and such
17 other factors as may be provided in the participant contract or required by
18 the commissioner.
19 (g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
20 arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell captive
21 insurance company may conduct.
22 (h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
23 such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any of
24 its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
25 (i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution shall
26 be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive insurance
27 company or participant without the commissioner's approval. In no event
28 shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale, exchange, transfer,
29 dividend or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment of a
30 protected cell.
31 (j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells and
32 the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
33 approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets or liabilities
34 shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance company between its
35 general account and any protected cell or between any protected cells. The
36 protected cell captive insurance company shall attribute all insurance
37 obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a reinsurance contract entered
38 into with respect to a protected cell to such protected cell. The
39 performance under such reinsurance contract and any tax benefits, losses,
40 refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax allocation agreement to which
41 the protected cell captive insurance company is a party, including any
42 payments made by or due to be made to the protected cell captive
43 insurance company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, shall reflect
HB 2334 6
1 the insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to the reinsurance
2 contract that are attributed to such protected cell.
3 (k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation
4 of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets and liabilities of a
5 protected cell shall, to the extent that the commissioner determines that
6 such assets and liabilities are separable, at all times be kept separate from
7 and shall not be commingled with those of other protected cells and the
8 protected cell captive insurance company.
9 (l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually file
10 with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
11 commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without limitation,
12 accounting statements detailing the financial experience of each protected
13 cell.

15 commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell that
16 is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense obligations.
17 (n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
18 commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new protected
19 cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of any existing
20 protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of operation requiring
21 the commissioner's prior written approval.
22 (o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
23 company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
24 (1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any
25 state;
26 (2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state; or
27 (3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
28 policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or
29 other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The amount of
30 security provided shall be not less than the reserves associated with those
31 liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured, including reserves for
32 losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
33 and unearned premiums for business written through the participant's
34 protected cell. The commissioner may require the protected cell captive
35 insurance company to increase the funding of any security arrangement
36 established under this subsection. If the form of security is a letter of
37 credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved
38 by the commissioner. A trust maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
39 be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the
40 commissioner.
41 (p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in addition
42 to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
43 amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected cell
HB 2334 7
1 captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines that one
2 or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may separate
3 such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company and may
4 allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance company, for
5 the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing
6 protected cell captive insurance companies or one or more other captive
7 insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of operation as the

40 be made, a financial examination of any captive insurance company in the
41 process of organization or applying for admission or doing business in
42 Kansas. The commissioner may engage in continuous analysis for the
43 preparation of the examination. In addition, at the commissioner's
HB 2334 15
1 discretion, the commissioner may make, or direct to be made, a market
2 regulation examination of any insurance company doing business in
3 Kansas.
4 (b) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of
5 examinations of financial condition, the commissioner shall consider such
6 matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in
7 management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent
8 certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's
9 handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners
10 in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this subsection.
11 (c) The commissioner shall have free access to the books and papers

15 agents or employees of any such company in relation to its affairs,
16 transactions and condition.
17 (d) For the purpose of such analysis, the commissioner may require

20 the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is,
21 in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the
22 examination of the company, but such examination or investigation shall
23 not infringe upon or extend to any communications or information
24 accorded privileged or confidential status under any other laws of this
25 state.
26 (f) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the
27 commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall appoint one or more
28 examiners to perform the examination and instruct such examiners as to
29 the scope of the examination. The commissioner may also employ such
30 other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner may deem appropriate.
31 (g) When making an examination under this act, the commissioner
32 may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent

36 (h) (1) Not later than 30 days following completion of the
37 examination or at such earlier time as the commissioner shall prescribe,

43 written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the
HB 2334 16
1 examination report.
2 (2) Within 30 days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of

4 review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and
5 any relevant portions of the examiners' workpapers, and enter an order:
6 (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or
7 corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating
8 in violation of any law, rule and regulation or prior order of the
9 commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any
10 action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure such
11 violations;
12 (B) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners
13 to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data,
14 documentation or information; or
15 (C) call for and conduct a fact-finding hearing in accordance with
16 K.S.A. 40-281, and amendments thereto, for purposes of obtaining
17 additional documentation, data, information and testimony.
18 (3) All orders entered as a result of revelations contained in the final
19 examination report shall be accompanied by findings and conclusions

22 submissions or rebuttals. Within 30 days of the issuance of the adopted
23 report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors
24 stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and
25 related orders.
26 (4) Upon the adoption of the examination report of an association
27 captive insurance company, the commissioner shall hold the content of the
28 examination report as private and confidential as to the pure captive
29 insurance company. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to
30 limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make
31 public any final or preliminary examination report in the furtherance of
32 any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the
33 commissioner's discretion, deem appropriate.
34 (i) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the
35 commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order
36 to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of
37 this state.
38 (j) All examination reports, preliminary examination reports or
39 results, working papers, recorded information, documents and copies
40 thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any

42 confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public
43 by the commissioner or an employee or agent of the commissioner without
HB 2334 17
1 the written consent of the company, except to the extent provided in this
2 subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the commissioner

1 (c) all contracts or sample contracts between the applicant and any
2 participants; and
3 (d) evidence that expenses shall be allocated to each protected cell in
4 a fair and equitable manner.
5 New Sec. 5. A protected cell captive insurance company formed or
6 licensed under this chapter may establish and maintain one or more
7 incorporated or unincorporated protected cells to insure risks of one or
8 more participants, subject to the following conditions:
9 (a) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company may establish one
10 or more protected cells if the commissioner has approved in writing a plan
11 of operation or amendments to a plan of operation submitted by the
12 protected cell captive insurance company with respect to each protected
13 cell. A plan of operation includes, but is not limited to, the specific
14 business objectives and investment guidelines of the protected cell, except
15 that the commissioner may require additional information in the plan of
16 operation. The commissioner may put into effect a plan of operation or
17 amendments to a plan of operation on or before the date that the approval
18 is signed if the effective date is not earlier than the date that the plan of
19 operation or amendments to the plan of operation were filed with the
20 department;
21 (2) upon the commissioner's written approval of the plan of operation,
22 the protected cell captive insurance company, in accordance with the
23 approved plan of operation, may attribute insurance obligations with
24 respect to its insurance business to the protected cell;
25 (3) a protected cell shall have its own distinct name or designation
26 that shall include the words "protected cell" or "incorporated cell." An
27 incorporated cell formed as a series of a limited liability company shall
28 bear a distinct name or designation as reflected in its formation documents
29 and include the words "series cell." Such names or designations may also
30 be reasonably abbreviated, including, without limitation, pc or p.c. for
31 "protected cell," ic, i.c., ipc, or i.p.c. for "incorporated cell" and sc, s.c.,
32 spc or s.p.c. for "series cell";
33 (4) the protected cell captive insurance company shall transfer all
34 assets attributable to a protected cell to one or more separately established
35 and identified protected cell accounts bearing the name or designation of
36 such protected cell. Protected cell assets shall be held in the protected cell
37 accounts for the purpose of satisfying the obligations of such protected
38 cell;
39 (5) an incorporated protected cell may be organized and operated in
40 any form of business organization authorized by the commissioner,
41 including, but not limited to, an individual series of a limited liability
42 company as provided for in the Kansas revised limited liability company
43 act. Each incorporated protected cell of a protected cell captive insurer

HB 2334 4
1 shall be treated as a captive insurer for purposes of this act and shall have
2 the power to enter into contracts, including an individual series of a limited
3 liability company. Unless otherwise permitted by the organizational
4 documents of a protected cell captive insurer, each incorporated protected
5 cell of the protected cell captive insurer shall have the same directors,
6 secretary and registered office as the protected cell captive insurer; and
7 (6) all attributions of assets and liabilities between a protected cell
8 and the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
9 and participant contracts approved by the commissioner. No other
10 attribution of assets or liabilities shall be made by a protected cell captive
11 insurance company between the protected cell captive insurance
12 company's general account and its protected cells. Any attribution of assets
13 and liabilities between the general account and a protected cell shall be in
14 cash or in readily marketable securities with established market values.
15 (b) The creation of a protected cell does not create, with respect to
16 such protected cell, a legal person separate from the protected cell captive
17 insurance company unless the protected cell is an incorporated cell.
18 Amounts attributed to a protected cell under this section, including assets
19 transferred to a protected cell account, are deemed to be owned by the
20 protected cell. No protected cell captive insurance company shall be, or
21 represent itself as a trustee with respect to those protected cell assets of
22 such protected cell account. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
23 subsection, the protected cell captive insurance company may allow for a
24 security interest to attach to protected cell assets or a protected cell
25 account when in favor of a creditor of the protected cell and otherwise
26 allowed under applicable law.
27 (c) This act shall not be construed to prohibit the protected cell
28 captive insurance company from contracting with or arranging for an
29 investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or other third party to
30 manage the protected cell assets of a protected cell if all remuneration,
31 expenses and other compensation of the third-party advisor or manager are
32 payable from the protected cell assets of such protected cell and not from
33 the protected cell assets of other protected cells or the assets of the
34 protected cell captive insurance company's general account.
35 (d) (1) A protected cell captive insurance company shall establish
36 administrative and accounting procedures necessary to properly identify
37 the one or more protected cells of the protected cell captive insurance
38 company and the protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
39 attributable to the protected cells. The directors of a protected cell captive
40 insurance company shall keep protected cell assets and protected cell
41 liabilities:
42 (A) Separate and separately identifiable from the assets and liabilities
43 of the protected cell captive insurance company's general account; and

HB 2334 5
1 (B) attributable to one protected cell that is separate and separately
2 identifiable from protected cell assets and protected cell liabilities
3 attributable to other protected cells.
4 (2) If subsection (d)(1) is violated, then the remedy of tracing is
5 applicable to protected cell assets when commingled with protected cell
6 assets of other protected cells or the assets of the protected cell captive
7 insurance company's general account. The remedy of tracing shall not be
8 construed as an exclusive remedy.
9 (e) When establishing a protected cell, the protected cell captive
10 insurance company shall attribute to the protected cell assets a value that is
11 at least equal to the reserves and other insurance liabilities attributed to
12 such protected cell.
13 (f) Each protected cell shall be accounted for separately on the books
14 and records of the protected cell captive insurance company to reflect the
15 financial condition and results of operations of such protected cell, net
16 income or loss, dividends or other distributions to participants and such
17 other factors as may be provided in the participant contract or required by
18 the commissioner.
19 (g) No asset of a protected cell shall be chargeable with liabilities
20 arising out of any other insurance business that the protected cell captive
21 insurance company may conduct.
22 (h) No sale, exchange or other transfer of assets shall be made by
23 such protected cell captive insurance company between or among any of
24 its protected cells without the consent of such protected cells.
25 (i) No sale, exchange, transfer of assets, dividend or distribution shall
26 be made from a protected cell to another protected cell captive insurance
27 company or participant without the commissioner's approval. In no event
28 shall the commissioner's approval be given if the sale, exchange, transfer,
29 dividend or distribution would result in the insolvency or impairment of a
30 protected cell.
31 (j) All attributions of assets and liabilities to the protected cells and
32 the general account shall be in accordance with the plan of operation
33 approved by the commissioner. No other attribution of assets or liabilities
34 shall be made by a protected cell captive insurance company between its
35 general account and any protected cell or between any protected cells. The
36 protected cell captive insurance company shall attribute all insurance
37 obligations, assets and liabilities relating to a reinsurance contract entered
38 into with respect to a protected cell to such protected cell. The
39 performance under such reinsurance contract and any tax benefits, losses,
40 refunds or credits allocated pursuant to a tax allocation agreement to which
41 the protected cell captive insurance company is a party, including any
42 payments made by or due to be made to the protected cell captive
43 insurance company pursuant to the terms of such agreement, shall reflect

HB 2334 6
1 the insurance obligations, assets and liabilities relating to the reinsurance
2 contract that are attributed to such protected cell.
3 (k) In connection with the conservation, rehabilitation or liquidation
4 of a protected cell captive insurance company, the assets and liabilities of a
5 protected cell shall, to the extent that the commissioner determines that
6 such assets and liabilities are separable, at all times be kept separate from
7 and shall not be commingled with those of other protected cells and the
8 protected cell captive insurance company.
9 (l) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall annually file
10 with the commissioner such financial reports as required by the
11 commissioner. Any such financial report shall include, without limitation,
12 accounting statements detailing the financial experience of each protected
13 cell.
14 (m) Each protected cell captive insurance company shall notify the
15 commissioner in writing within 10 business days of any protected cell that
16 is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its claim or expense obligations.
17 (n) No participant contract shall take effect without the
18 commissioner's prior written approval. The addition of each new protected
19 cell, the withdrawal of any participant or the termination of any existing
20 protected cell shall constitute a change in the plan of operation requiring
21 the commissioner's prior written approval.
22 (o) The business written by a protected cell captive insurance
23 company, with respect to each protected cell, shall be:
24 (1) Fronted by an insurance company licensed under the laws of any
25 state;
26 (2) reinsured by a reinsurer authorized or approved by this state; or
27 (3) secured by a trust fund in the United States for the benefit of
28 policyholders and claimants or funded by an irrevocable letter of credit or
29 other arrangement that is acceptable to the commissioner. The amount of
30 security provided shall be not less than the reserves associated with those
31 liabilities that are neither fronted nor reinsured, including reserves for
32 losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses, incurred but not reported losses
33 and unearned premiums for business written through the participant's
34 protected cell. The commissioner may require the protected cell captive
35 insurance company to increase the funding of any security arrangement
36 established under this subsection. If the form of security is a letter of
37 credit, the letter of credit shall be issued or confirmed by a bank approved
38 by the commissioner. A trust maintained pursuant to this subsection shall
39 be established in a form and upon such terms approved by the
40 commissioner.
41 (p) Notwithstanding this act or other laws of Kansas, and in addition
42 to article 36 of chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
43 amendments thereto, in the event of an insolvency of a protected cell

HB 2334 7
1 captive insurance company in which the commissioner determines that one
2 or more protected cells remain solvent, the commissioner may separate
3 such cells from the protected cell captive insurance company and may
4 allow, on application of the protected cell captive insurance company, for
5 the conversion of such protected cells into one or more new or existing
6 protected cell captive insurance companies or one or more other captive
7 insurance companies, pursuant to such plan of operation as the
8 commissioner deems acceptable.
9 (q) Biographical affidavits shall not be required for participants in
10 unincorporated cells. Biographical affidavits shall be required for owners
11 of incorporated cells, including series members of a series LLC.
12 (r) A protected cell captive insurance company formed or licensed
13 under this act may establish and operate unincorporated and incorporated
14 protected cells.

26 New Sec. 7. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4, and

28 combined for purposes of investment, and such combination shall not be
29 construed as defeating the segregation of such assets for accounting or
30 other purposes.

32 may approve the use of alternative reliable methods of valuation and

8 account is party to this suit, it shall be separately identified in the
9 pleadings as if it were a protected cell.
10 (b) A legal action brought against a protected cell captive insurance
11 company that does not specify one or more protected cells shall be deemed
12 to have been brought against the general account only.
13 (c) Any protected cell that is not named in the pleadings of the legal
14 action shall not be deemed to be a party to the legal action. Any protected
15 cell that is erroneously named as a party or named without proper cause

17 (d) Unless specified by the plan of operation, participant contract or
18 other prior contractual agreement, the assets of one protected cell may not
19 be encumbered or seized to satisfy the obligations of or a judgment against
20 any other protected cell. No protected cell shall have a duty to defend the
21 rights and obligations of any other protected cell.
22 (e) In any legal action involving a protected cell captive insurance
23 company or a protected cell, any papers, documents or property of a
24 nonparty protected cell shall be afforded the same status during discovery
25 as the documents or property of any other unrelated third party. A nonparty
26 protected cell shall have standing to appear and petition for any
27 appropriate relief to protect the confidentiality of its papers or documents.
28 New Sec. 10. (a) (1) Upon the application of a protected cell captive
29 insurance company, one of its protected cells may be converted to any
30 form of captive insurance company authorized pursuant to chapter 40 of
31 the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, with the consent

18 (b) A captive insurance company may apply to the commissioner for
19 conversion to become a protected cell captive insurance company under

22 documents with the secretary of state, the captive insurance company shall
23 be issued a revised certificate of authority. The effective date of the revised
24 protected cell captive insurance company's certificate of authority shall

HB 2334 15
1 discretion, the commissioner may make, or direct to be made, a market
2 regulation examination of any insurance company doing business in
3 Kansas.
4 (b) In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of
5 examinations of financial condition, the commissioner shall consider such
6 matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in
7 management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent
8 certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the examiner's

15 agents or employees of any such company in relation to its affairs,
16 transactions and condition.
17 (d) For the purpose of such analysis, the commissioner may require
18 reports and other documents be filed with the commissioner.
19 (e) The commissioner may also examine or investigate any person, or
20 the business of any person, insofar as such examination or investigation is,
21 in the sole discretion of the commissioner, necessary or material to the
22 examination of the company, but such examination or investigation shall
23 not infringe upon or extend to any communications or information
24 accorded privileged or confidential status under any other laws of this
25 state.
26 (f) Upon determining that an examination should be conducted, the
27 commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall appoint one or more

36 (h) (1) Not later than 30 days following completion of the
37 examination or at such earlier time as the commissioner shall prescribe,
38 the examiner in charge shall file with the deparment a verified written
39 report of examination under oath. Not later than 30 days following receipt
40 of the verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the
41 company examined, together with a notice that shall afford such company

1 examination report.
2 (2) Within 30 days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of
3 written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and
4 review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and
5 any relevant portions of the examiners' workpapers, and enter an order:
6 (A) Adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or
7 corrections. If the examination report reveals that the company is operating
8 in violation of any law, rule and regulation or prior order of the
9 commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any
10 action the commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure such
11 violations;
12 (B) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners
13 to reopen the examination for purposes of obtaining additional data,
14 documentation or information; or
15 (C) call for and conduct a fact-finding hearing in accordance with
16 K.S.A. 40-281, and amendments thereto, for purposes of obtaining
17 additional documentation, data, information and testimony.

21 examination report, relevant examiner work papers and any written
22 submissions or rebuttals. Within 30 days of the issuance of the adopted
23 report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each of its directors
24 stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and
25 related orders.
26 (4) Upon the adoption of the examination report of an association
27 captive insurance company, the commissioner shall hold the content of the
28 examination report as private and confidential as to the pure captive
29 insurance company. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to
30 limit the commissioner's authority to use and, if appropriate, to make
31 public any final or preliminary examination report in the furtherance of
32 any legal or regulatory action that the commissioner may, in the
33 commissioner's discretion, deem appropriate.
34 (i) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to limit the
35 commissioner's authority to terminate or suspend any examination in order
36 to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of
37 this state.
38 (j) All examination reports, preliminary examination reports or
39 results, working papers, recorded information, documents and copies
40 thereof produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the commissioner or any
41 other person in the course of an examination made under this section are
42 confidential and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public
43 by the commissioner or an employee or agent of the commissioner without

HB 2334 17
1 the written consent of the company, except to the extent provided in this
2 subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the commissioner
3 from using such information in furtherance of the commissioner's
4 regulatory authority under this act. The commissioner may grant access to

13 written consent of the company to which it pertains has been obtained.
14 (k) The commissioner may receive documents, materials or
15 information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents,
