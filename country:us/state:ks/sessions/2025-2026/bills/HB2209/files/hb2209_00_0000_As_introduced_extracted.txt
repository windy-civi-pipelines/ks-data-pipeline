40 made, and such suppliers shall execute invoices covering such purchases
41 bearing the number of such certificate. Upon completion of the project, the
42 contractor shall furnish to such eligible not-for-profit corporation a sworn

1 purchases so made were entitled to exemption under this subsection. All
2 invoices shall be held by the contractor for a period of five years and shall
3 be subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any materials purchased

5 building or returned for credit, the contractor shall report and pay the sales
6 or compensating tax to the director of taxation not later than the 20th day of
7 the month following the close of the month in which it is determined that
8 such materials will not be used for the purpose for which such certificate

10 liable for tax on all materials purchased for the project, and upon payment
11 thereof, the eligible not-for-profit corporation may recover the same from
12 the contractor together with reasonable attorney fees. Any contractor or
13 any agent, employee or subcontractor thereof who shall use or otherwise
14 dispose of any materials purchased under such a certificate for any purpose
15 other than that for which such a certificate is issued without the payment
16 of the sales or compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials
17 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be
18 subject to the penalties provided for in K.S.A. 79-3615(h), and
19 amendments thereto.
20 (2) Sales tax paid on and after May 19, 2023, but prior to the effective
21 date of this act upon the gross receipts received from any sale which would

24 for a sales tax refund shall be verified and submitted to the director of
25 taxation upon forms furnished by the director and shall be accompanied by
26 any additional documentation required by the director. The director shall
27 review each claim and shall refund that amount of sales tax paid as
28 determined under the provisions of this subsection. All refunds shall be
29 paid from the sales tax refund fund upon warrants of the director of
30 accounts and reports pursuant to vouchers approved by the director or the
31 director's designee; and

34 tangible personal property or service are used or proposed to be used in

HB 2209 2
1 such business; or (2) such political subdivision is engaged or proposes to

16 research foundation of Kansas located in Wichita, Kansas, multi
17 community diversified services, incorporated, located in McPherson,

19 for the deaf;
20 (d) all sales of tangible personal property or services purchased by a
21 contractor for the purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing,

23 any public or private nonprofit hospital or public hospital authority, public
24 or private elementary or secondary school, a public or private nonprofit
25 educational institution, state correctional institution including a privately

30 tangible personal property or services purchased by a contractor for the
31 purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing, maintaining, repairing,
32 enlarging, furnishing or remodeling facilities for any political subdivision
33 of the state or district described in subsection (s), the total cost of which is
34 paid from funds of such political subdivision or district and that would be
35 exempt from taxation under the provisions of this act if purchased directly
36 by such political subdivision or district. Nothing in this subsection or in
37 the provisions of K.S.A. 12-3418, and amendments thereto, shall be

42 K.S.A. 12-3418 and 79-3640, and amendments thereto, "funds of a

9 shall contract for the purpose of constructing, equipping, reconstructing,
10 maintaining, repairing, enlarging, furnishing or remodeling facilities, it
11 shall obtain from the state and furnish to the contractor an exemption
12 certificate for the project involved, and the contractor may purchase
13 materials for incorporation in such project. The contractor shall furnish the
14 number of such certificate to all suppliers from whom such purchases are
15 made, and such suppliers shall execute invoices covering the same bearing
16 the number of such certificate. Upon completion of the project the
17 contractor shall furnish to the political subdivision, district described in
18 subsection (s), hospital or public hospital authority, school, educational
19 institution or department of corrections concerned a sworn statement, on a
20 form to be provided by the director of taxation, that all purchases so made
21 were entitled to exemption under this subsection. As an alternative to the
22 foregoing procedure, any such contracting entity may apply to the
23 secretary of revenue for agent status for the sole purpose of issuing and
24 furnishing project exemption certificates to contractors pursuant to rules
25 and regulations adopted by the secretary establishing conditions and
26 standards for the granting and maintaining of such status. All invoices
27 shall be held by the contractor for a period of five years and shall be
28 subject to audit by the director of taxation. If any materials purchased
29 under such a certificate are found not to have been incorporated in the
30 building or other project or not to have been returned for credit or the sales
31 or compensating tax otherwise imposed upon such materials that will not
32 be so incorporated in the building or other project reported and paid by
33 such contractor to the director of taxation not later than the 20th day of the
34 month following the close of the month in which it shall be determined
35 that such materials will not be used for the purpose for which such
36 certificate was issued, the political subdivision, district described in
37 subsection (s), hospital or public hospital authority, school, educational
38 institution or the contractor contracting with the department of corrections
39 for a correctional institution concerned shall be liable for tax on all
40 materials purchased for the project, and upon payment thereof it may
41 recover the same from the contractor together with reasonable attorney
42 fees. Any contractor or any agent, employee or subcontractor thereof, who
43 shall use or otherwise dispose of any materials purchased under such a

HB 2209 4
1 certificate for any purpose other than that for which such a certificate is
2 issued without the payment of the sales or compensating tax otherwise
3 imposed upon such materials, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon
4 conviction therefor, shall be subject to the penalties provided for in K.S.A.
5 79-3615(h), and amendments thereto;
6 (e) all sales of tangible personal property or services purchased by a
7 contractor for the erection, repair or enlargement of buildings or other
8 projects for the government of the United States, its agencies or
9 instrumentalities, that would be exempt from taxation if purchased directly
