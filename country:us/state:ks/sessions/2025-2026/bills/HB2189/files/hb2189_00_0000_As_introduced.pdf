4 K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 and repealing the existing section.
5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
9 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
10 with the modifications specified in this section.
11 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
12 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
13 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
14 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
15 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
16 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
17 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
18 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
19 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
20 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
21 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after
22 December 31, 1987, shall be excluded from computation of Kansas
23 adjusted gross income whether or not included in federal adjusted gross
24 income.
25 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
26 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
27 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not
28 credited against federal income tax. This paragraph shall not apply to taxes
29 imposed under the provisions of K.S.A. 79-1107 or 79-1108, and
30 amendments thereto, for privilege tax year 1995, and all such years
31 thereafter.
32 (iii) The federal net operating loss deduction, except that the federal
33 net operating loss deduction shall not be added to an individual's federal
34 adjusted gross income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2016.
35 (iv) Federal income tax refunds received by the taxpayer if the

HB 2189 2
1 deduction of the taxes being refunded resulted in a tax benefit for Kansas
2 income tax purposes during a prior taxable year. Such refunds shall be
3 included in income in the year actually received regardless of the method
4 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
5 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
6 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
7 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
8 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
9 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
10 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
11 federal income taxes paid for such year. For purposes of the foregoing
12 sentence, federal taxes shall be considered to have been deducted only to
13 the extent such deduction does not reduce Kansas taxable income below
14 zero.

16 deduction claimed on the taxpayer's federal income tax return for any
