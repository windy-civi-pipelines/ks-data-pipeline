individual who is, has been or has the potential to be the subject of
abuse if the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the
owner of the insurance policy.

from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical
or mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
provided that:

the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same
coverage, solely because of such individual's status as a living organ
donor. With respect to all other conditions, persons who are living
SENATE BILL No. 42—page 10
organ donors shall be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial
principles or actual or reasonably anticipated experience as are persons
who are not organ donors.

any dividends or profits accrued thereon, or anything of value
whatsoever not specified in the contract.
(b) Nothing in subsection (7)(a) or (8)(a) shall be construed as
including within the definition of discrimination or rebates any of the
following practices:
(i) In the case of any contract of life insurance or life annuity,
paying bonuses to policyholders or otherwise abating their premiums in
whole or in part out of surplus accumulated from nonparticipating
insurance. Any such bonuses or abatement of premiums shall be fair
and equitable to policyholders and for the best interests of the company
and its policyholders;
(ii) in the case of life insurance policies issued on the industrial
debit plan, making allowance to policyholders who have continuously
for a specified period made premium payments directly to an office of
the insurer in an amount that fairly represents the saving in collection
expenses;
(iii) readjustment of the rate of premium for a group insurance
policy based on the loss or expense experience thereunder, at the end of
the first or any subsequent policy year of insurance thereunder, which
may be made retroactive only for such policy year;
(iv) engaging in an arrangement that would not violate section 106
of the bank holding company act amendments of 1972, as interpreted
by the board of governors of the federal reserve system or section 5(q)
of the home owners' loan act;
(v) the offer or provision by insurers or producers, by or through
employees, affiliates or third-party representatives, of value-added
products or services at no or reduced cost when such products or
services are not specified in the policy of insurance if the product or
service:
(A) Relates to the insurance coverage; and
(B) is primarily designed to satisfy one or more of the following:
(1) Provide loss mitigation or loss control;
(2) reduce claim costs or claim settlement costs;
(3) provide education about liability risks or risk of loss to persons
or property;
(4) monitor or assess risk, identify sources of risk or develop
strategies for eliminating or reducing risk;
(5) enhance health;
(6) enhance financial wellness through items such as education or
financial planning services;
(7) provide post-loss services;
(8) (a) incentivize behavioral changes to improve the health or
reduce the risk of death or disability of a customer;

potential policyholder, certificate holder, potential certificate holder,
insured, potential insured or applicant; or
(9) assist in the administration of the employee or retiree benefit
insurance coverage.
(C) The cost to the insurer or producer offering the product or
service to any given customer shall be reasonable in comparison to
such customer's premiums or insurance coverage for the policy class.
(D) If the insurer or producer is providing the product or service
offered, the insurer or producer shall ensure that the customer is
provided with contact information, upon request, to assist the customer
with questions regarding the product or service.
(E) The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations when
implementing the permitted practices set forth in this section to ensure
consumer protection. Such rules and regulations, consistent with
applicable law, may address, among other issues, consumer data
protections and privacy, consumer disclosure and unfair discrimination.
(F) The availability of the value-added product or service shall be
based on documented objective criteria and offered in a manner that is
not unfairly discriminatory. The documented criteria shall be
maintained by the insurer or producer and produced upon request by
the commissioner.
(G) (1) If an insurer or producer does not have sufficient evidence
but has a good-faith belief that the product or service meets the criteria
in subsection (8)(b)(v)(B), the insurer or producer may provide the
product or service in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory as part
of a pilot or testing program for not more than one year. An insurer or
producer shall notify the commissioner of such a pilot or testing
program offered to consumers in this state prior to launching and may
proceed with the program unless the commissioner objects within 21
days of notice.
(2) If the insurer or producer is unable to determine sufficient
evidence within the one-year pilot or testing period, the insurer or
producer may request that such pilot or testing period be extended for
such additional time as necessary to determine if the product or service
meets the criteria described in subsection (8)(b)(v)(B). Upon such a
request, the commissioner may grant an extension of a specified time.
(vi) An insurer or a producer may:
(A) Offer or give non-cash gifts, items or services, including
meals to or charitable donations on behalf of a customer, in connection
with the marketing, sale, purchase or retention of contracts of
insurance, as long as the cost does not exceed an amount determined to
be reasonable by the commissioner per policy year per term. The offer
shall be made in a manner that is not unfairly discriminatory. The
customer shall not be required to purchase, continue to purchase or
renew a policy in exchange for the gift, item or service.
(B) Conduct raffles or drawings to the extent permitted by state
law, as long as there is no financial cost to entrants to participate, the
drawing or raffle does not obligate participants to purchase insurance,
the prizes are not valued in excess of a reasonable amount determined
by the commissioner and the drawing or raffle is open to the public.
The raffle or drawing shall be offered in a manner that is not unfairly
discriminatory. The customer shall not be required to purchase,
continue to purchase or renew a policy in exchange for the gift, item or
service.
(c) An insurer, producer or representative of an insurer or
producer shall not offer or provide insurance as an inducement to the
purchase of another policy.

reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or
made part of an application;
(i) attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that
was altered without notice to, or knowledge or consent of the insured;
(j) making claims payments to insureds or beneficiaries not
accompanied by a statement setting forth the coverage under which
payments are being made;

from arbitration awards in favor of insureds or claimants for the
purpose of compelling them to accept settlements or compromises less
than the amount awarded in arbitration;
(l) delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an
insured, claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary
claim report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal
proof of loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially
the same information;

reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in

Failure of any person, who is an insurer on an insurance policy, to
maintain a complete record of all the complaints that it has received
since the date of its last examination under K.S.A. 40-222, and

rebate, reduction or abatement of any charge, or any special favor or
advantage or any monetary consideration or inducement referred to in
subsection (14)(a) (15)(a).
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting:

to a title insurance agent in connection with a title insurance
transaction;
(ii) the payment of an earned commission to a duly appointed title
insurance agent for services actually performed in the issuance of the
policy of title insurance; or

expenses.
(d) Nothing in this section prohibits the division of rates and
charges between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or
one or more title insurance companies and one or more title insurance
agents, if such division of rates and charges does not constitute an
unlawful rebate under the provisions of this section and is not in
payment of a forwarding fee or a finder's fee.

partner thereof, or owner of a financial interest;, the spouse or any
relative within the second degree by blood or marriage of a producer of
SENATE BILL No. 42—page 14
title business who is a natural person;, any director, officer or employee

(ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal
or beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or
more of the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest
is held. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or
any other type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the
primary purpose of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the
financial benefit to be obtained as a consequence of that interest from
the referral of title business.
(iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
(iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,

title insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows
or has reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any
producer of title business or by any associate of such producer, where
the producer, the associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title
insurer or title agent to which business is referred unless the producer
has disclosed to the buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the
producer of title business or associate referring the title insurance
business.
(g) (i) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain

transaction will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or
title agent; and (ii) (B) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that
title insurer or title agent during the 12 full calendar months
immediately preceding the month in which the transaction takes place

officer or designee, under penalty of perjury, stating the percent of
SENATE BILL No. 42—page 15

title insurer or title agent is found to be in substantial compliance with
competitive behavior as defined by federal housing and urban
development statement of policy 1996-2.
(i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer,
the associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title
agent to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in

insurer if such producer has a financial interest in such title agent or
title insurer.
(3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance

(4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
business or associate of such producer from referring title business to
any title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice,
and, if such producer or associate of such producer has any financial
interest in the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends
produced or realized from such financial interest, so long as if:
(a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
(b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange
for the referral of business; and
(c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a
return on the investment of the producer or associate.
(5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer
who violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any

insurance, shall be subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount
equal to five times the premium for the title insurance and, if licensed
SENATE BILL No. 42—page 16
pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be
deemed to have committed a prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-
3602, and amendments thereto, and shall be liable to the purchaser of
such title insurance in an amount equal to the premium for the title
insurance.

person shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to
the provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (,
public law 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and
regulations necessary to carry out this subsection. Such rules and
regulations shall be consistent with and not more restrictive than the
model regulation adopted on September 26, 2000, by the national
association of insurance commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer
financial and health information regulation"."

abuse if the perpetrator of the abuse is the applicant or would be the
owner of the insurance policy.

from underwriting or rating a risk on the basis of a preexisting physical
or mental condition, even if such condition has been caused by abuse,
provided that:

the amount, extent or kind of coverage available for life insurance to an
individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the same
coverage, solely because of such individual's status as a living organ
donor. With respect to all other conditions, persons who are living

SENATE BILL No. 42—page 10
organ donors shall be subject to the same standards of sound actuarial
principles or actual or reasonably anticipated experience as are persons
who are not organ donors.

and its policyholders;

person may knowingly receive or accept, directly or indirectly, any
rebate, reduction or abatement of any charge, or any special favor or
advantage or any monetary consideration or inducement referred to in
subsection (14)(a) (15)(a).
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting:
(i) The payment of reasonable fees for services actually rendered
to a title insurance agent in connection with a title insurance
transaction;
(ii) the payment of an earned commission to a duly appointed title
insurance agent for services actually performed in the issuance of the
policy of title insurance; or
(iii) the payment of reasonable entertainment and advertising
expenses.
(d) Nothing in this section prohibits the division of rates and
charges between or among a title insurance company and its agent, or
one or more title insurance companies and one or more title insurance
agents, if such division of rates and charges does not constitute an

partnership, business trust, corporation or other legal entity organized
for profit in which a producer of title business is a director, officer or
partner thereof, or owner of a financial interest;, the spouse or any
relative within the second degree by blood or marriage of a producer of

SENATE BILL No. 42—page 14
title business who is a natural person;, any director, officer or employee

(ii) "Financial interest" means any direct or indirect interest, legal
or beneficial, where the holder thereof is or will be entitled to 1% or
more of the net profits or net worth of the entity in which such interest
is held. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest of less than 1% or
any other type of interest shall constitute a "financial interest" if the
primary purpose of the acquisition or retention of that interest is the
financial benefit to be obtained as a consequence of that interest from
the referral of title business.
(iii) "Person" means any natural person, partnership, association,
cooperative, corporation, trust or other legal entity.
(iv) "Producer of title business" or "producer" means any person,

title insurance policy to, or provide services to, an applicant if it knows
or has reason to believe that the applicant was referred to it by any
producer of title business or by any associate of such producer, where
the producer, the associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title
insurer or title agent to which business is referred unless the producer
has disclosed to the buyer, seller and lender the financial interest of the
producer of title business or associate referring the title insurance
business.
(g) (i) No title insurer or title agent may accept an order for title
insurance business, issue a title insurance policy, or receive or retain

The title insurer or title agent knows or has reason to believe that the
transaction will constitute controlled business for that title insurer or
title agent; and (ii) (B) 70% or more of the closed title orders of that
title insurer or title agent during the 12 full calendar months
immediately preceding the month in which the transaction takes place
is derived from controlled business. The prohibitions contained in this
paragraph shall not apply to transactions involving real estate located in

report executed by the title insurer's or title agent's chief executive
officer or designee, under penalty of perjury, stating the percent of

SENATE BILL No. 42—page 15
closed title orders originating from controlled business. The failure of a
title insurer or title agent to comply with the requirements of this
section, at the discretion of the commissioner, shall be grounds for the
suspension or revocation of a license or other disciplinary action, with
the commissioner able to mitigate any such disciplinary action if the
title insurer or title agent is found to be in substantial compliance with
competitive behavior as defined by federal housing and urban
development statement of policy 1996-2.
(i) (1) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
order or issue a title insurance policy to any person if it knows or has
reason to believe that such person was referred to it by any producer of
title business or by any associate of such producer, where the producer,
the associate, or both, have a financial interest in the title insurer or title
agent to which business is referred unless the producer has disclosed in
writing to the person so referred the fact that such producer or associate

insurer if such producer has a financial interest in such title agent or
title insurer.
(3) No title insurer or title agent may accept any title insurance
order or issue a title insurance policy to any person it knows or has

company.
(4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit any producer of title
business or associate of such producer from referring title business to
any title insurer or title agent of such producer's or associate's choice,
and, if such producer or associate of such producer has any financial
interest in the title insurer, from receiving income, profits or dividends
produced or realized from such financial interest, so long as if:
(a) Such financial interest is disclosed to the purchaser of the title
insurance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(4);
(b) the payment of income, profits or dividends is not in exchange
for the referral of business; and
(c) the receipt of income, profits or dividends constitutes only a
return on the investment of the producer or associate.
(5) Any producer of title business or associate of such producer
who violates the provisions of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), or any
title insurer or title agent who accepts an order for title insurance
knowing that it is in violation of paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4), in
addition to any other action that may be taken by the commissioner of
insurance, shall be subject to a fine by the commissioner in an amount
equal to five times the premium for the title insurance and, if licensed

SENATE BILL No. 42—page 16
pursuant to K.S.A. 58-3034 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall be
deemed to have committed a prohibited act pursuant to K.S.A. 58-
3602, and amendments thereto, and shall be liable to the purchaser of
such title insurance in an amount equal to the premium for the title
insurance.
(6) Any title insurer or title agent that is a competitor of any title
insurer or title agent that, subsequent to the effective date of this act,

entitled, in addition to any other damages or remedies provided by law,

such action under this subsection, the court may award to the successful
party the court costs of the action together with reasonable attorney
fees.

core title services as required by the real estate settlement procedures
act.

person shall disclose any nonpublic personal information contrary to
the provisions of title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999 (,
public law 106-102). The commissioner may adopt rules and
regulations necessary to carry out this subsection. Such rules and
regulations shall be consistent with and not more restrictive than the
model regulation adopted on September 26, 2000, by the national
association of insurance commissioners entitled "Privacy of consumer
financial and health information regulation"."
(b) Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or construed to
authorize the promulgation or adoption of any regulation that preempts,

matter pertaining to the health and medical treatment for such minor.
