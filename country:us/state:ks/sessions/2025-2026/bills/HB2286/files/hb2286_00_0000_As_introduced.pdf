5 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
6 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 40-2,227 is hereby amended to read as
7 follows: 40-2,227. (a) No dental benefit plan shall contain restrictions on
8 methods of payment to a dentist from the dental benefit plan, such plan's
9 contracted vendor or health maintenance organization in which the only
10 acceptable payment method is a credit card payment.
11 (b) If initiating or changing payments to a dentist using electronic
12 funds transfer payments, including virtual credit card payments, a dental
13 benefit plan, such plan's contracted vendor or health maintenance
14 organization shall:
15 (1) Notify the dentist if any fees are associated with a particular
16 payment method; and
17 (2) advise the dentist of the available methods of payment and
18 provide clear instructions to the dentist as to how to select an alternative
19 payment method; and
20 (3) require that any decision by a dentist to select an alternative form
21 of payment shall remain in force through the duration of the contract and
22 any extension thereof.
23 (c) A dental benefit plan, such plan's contracted vendor or health
24 maintenance organization that initiates or changes payments to a dentist
25 through the automated clearing house network, as codified in 45 C.F.R. §§
26 162.1601 and 162.1602, as in effect on July 1, 2025, shall not charge a fee
27 solely to transmit the payment to a dentist unless the dentist has consented
28 to such fee. A dentist's agent may charge reasonable fees when
29 transmitting an automated clearing house network payment related to
30 transaction management, data management, portal services and other
31 value-added services in addition to the bank transmittal.
32 (d) The provisions of this section shall not be waived by contract.
33 Any contractual arrangement in conflict that conflicts with the provisions
34 of this section or that purports to waive any requirements of this section
35 shall be null and void and unenforceable.
