6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 22-4908 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
8 4908. (a) (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), a drug offender who is
9 required to register under the Kansas offender registration act may file a
10 verified petition for relief from registration requirements if the offender
11 has registered for a period of at least five years after the date of parole,
12 discharge or release, whichever date is most recent, or, if not confined, five
13 years from the date of conviction or adjudication.
14 (2) Except as provided in subsection (b), an offender described in this
15 paragraph who is required to register under the Kansas offender
16 registration act may file a verified petition for relief from registration
17 requirements if the offender has registered for a period of at least 10 years
18 after the date of parole, discharge or release, whichever date is most
19 recent, or, if not confined, 10 years from the date of conviction or
20 adjudication:
21 (A) An offender who was convicted or adjudicated of an offense prior
22 to July 1, 2011, that, at the time of conviction or adjudication, did not
23 require such offender to register under the Kansas offender registration
24 act, but is required to register because of the retroactive application of
25 section 6 of chapter 95 of the 2011 Session Laws of Kansas; and
26 (B) an offender who was originally required to register under the
27 Kansas offender registration act for 10 years for an offense committed
28 prior to July 1, 2011, but is required to register for a longer period
29 because of the retroactive application of section 6 of chapter 95 of the
30 2011 Session Laws of Kansas.
31 (b) An offender who is required to register pursuant to K.S.A. 22-
32 4906(k), and amendments thereto, because of an out-of-state conviction or
33 adjudication may not petition for relief from registration requirements in
34 this state if the offender would be required to register under the law of the
35 state or jurisdiction where the conviction or adjudication occurred. If the

HB 2173 2
1 offender would no longer be required to register under the law of the state
2 or jurisdiction where the conviction or adjudication occurred, the offender
3 may file a verified petition pursuant to subsection (a).
4 (c) Any period of time during which an offender is incarcerated in
5 any jail or correctional facility or during which the offender does not
6 substantially comply with the requirements of the Kansas offender
7 registration act shall not count toward the duration of registration required
8 in subsection (a).
9 (d) (1) A verified petition for relief from registration requirements
10 shall be filed in the district court in the county where the offender was
11 convicted or adjudicated of the offense requiring registration. If the

13 requiring registration, such petition shall be filed in the district court of
14 any county where the offender is currently required to register. The docket
15 fee shall be as provided in K.S.A. 60-2001, and amendments thereto.
16 (2) The petition shall include:

18 (B) the offender's full name at the time of conviction or adjudication
19 for the offense or offenses requiring registration, if different than the
20 offender's current name;
21 (C) the offender's sex, race and date of birth;
22 (D) the offense or offenses requiring registration;
23 (E) the date of conviction or adjudication for the offense or offenses
24 requiring registration;
25 (F) the court in which the offender was convicted or adjudicated of
26 the offense or offenses requiring registration;
27 (G) whether the offender has been arrested, convicted, adjudicated or
28 entered into a diversion agreement for any crime during the period the
29 offender is required to register; and
30 (H) the names of all treatment providers and agencies that have
31 treated the offender for mental health, substance abuse and offense-related
32 behavior since the date of the offense or offenses requiring registration.
33 (3) The judicial council shall develop a petition form for use under
34 this section.
35 (4) When a petition is filed, the court shall set a date for a hearing on
36 such petition and cause notice of the hearing to be given to the county or
37 district attorney in the county where the petition is filed. Any person who
38 may have relevant information about the offender may testify at the
39 hearing.
40 (5) The county or district attorney shall notify any victim of the
41 offense requiring registration who is alive and whose address is known or,
42 if the victim is deceased, the victim's family if the family's address is
43 known. The victim or victim's family shall not be compelled to testify or

HB 2173 3
1 provide any discovery to the offender.
2 (6) The county or district attorney shall have access to all applicable
3 records, including records that are otherwise confidential or privileged.
4 (e) (1) The court may require a drug offender who is petitioning for
5 relief under this section to undergo a risk assessment.
6 (2) Any risk assessment ordered under this subsection shall be
7 performed by a professional agreed upon by the parties or a professional
8 approved by the court. Such risk assessment shall be performed at the
9 offender's expense.
10 (f) The court shall order relief from registration requirements if the
11 offender shows by clear and convincing evidence that:
12 (1) The offender has not been convicted or adjudicated of a felony,
13 other than a felony violation or aggravated felony violation of K.S.A. 22-
14 4903, and amendments thereto, within the five years immediately
15 preceding the filing of the petition, and no proceedings involving any such
16 felony are presently pending or being instituted against the offender;
17 (2) the offender's circumstances, behavior and treatment history
18 demonstrate that the offender is sufficiently rehabilitated to warrant relief;
19 and
20 (3) registration of the offender is no longer necessary to promote
21 public safety.
22 (g) If the court denies an offender's petition for relief, the offender
23 shall not file another petition for relief until three years have elapsed,
24 unless a shorter time period is ordered by the court.
25 (h) If the court grants relief from registration requirements, the court
26 shall order that the offender be removed from the offender registry and that
27 the offender is no longer required to comply with registration
28 requirements. Within 14 days of any order, the court shall notify the
29 Kansas bureau of investigation and any local law enforcement agency that
30 registers the offender that the offender has been granted relief from
31 registration requirements. The Kansas bureau of investigation shall remove
32 such offender from any internet website maintained pursuant to K.S.A. 22-
33 4909, and amendments thereto.
34 (i) An offender may combine a petition for relief under this section
35 with a petition for expungement under K.S.A. 21-6614, and amendments
36 thereto, if the offense requiring registration is otherwise eligible for
37 expungement.
38 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 22-4908 is hereby repealed.
39 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
40 publication in the Kansas register.
