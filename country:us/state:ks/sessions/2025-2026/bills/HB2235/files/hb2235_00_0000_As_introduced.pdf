28 department of commerce deems reasonably necessary to facilitate
29 economic growth and development in one or more economic growth
30 zones. No such schedule shall be effective until after its publication in the
31 Kansas register. The department of commerce shall timely submit any
32 schedule published under this section to the commissioner. The
33 commissioner shall provide a copy of such schedule to any applicant for a
34 fiduciary financial institution charter prior to the issuance of such charter.
35 A fiduciary financial institution shall be subject to the schedule in
36 existence on the date such fiduciary financial institution's charter is issued
37 and shall not be subject to any schedules published after such date; and
38 (C) the department of commerce shall remit all distributions under

2 (2) the balance of the required distribution amount shall be distributed
3 to one or more qualified charities as defined in K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-

5 financial institution. An economic growth zone or qualified charity shall
6 have no obligation to repay any distributions received under this act or to
7 make any contributions to a fiduciary financial institution.
8 (g) The form, treatment and character of fidfin transactions under the
9 laws of this state shall be respected for all purposes of this act
10 notwithstanding the treatment or characterization of such transactions
11 under generally accepted accounting principles or for tax purposes.
12 (h) A fiduciary financial institution shall disclose to a customer the
13 information required by rules and regulations adopted by the
14 commissioner pursuant to K.S.A. 9-2322, and amendments thereto, to
15 ensure that the customer is informed regarding the nature of the customer's
16 transactions with the fiduciary financial institution, taking into account the
17 level of sophistication of the customer.
18 Sec. 8. K.S.A. 9-2312 is hereby amended to read as follows: 9-2312.
19 (a) Subject to the requirements of K.S.A. 9-2309(d), and amendments

21 (1) Employ attorneys, accountants, investment advisors, agents or
22 other persons, even if they are affiliated or associated with the fiduciary

37 authorized to perform under the laws of this state on behalf of another
38 fiduciary financial institution; and
39 (6) employ another fiduciary financial institution to perform any
40 services that a fiduciary financial institution is authorized to perform under
41 the laws of this state.
42 (b) A party engaged by a fiduciary financial institution pursuant to
43 subsection (a) shall not be deemed to have engaged in fidfin transactions,

HB 2235 13
1 custodial services or trust business in this state nor shall such party be
2 deemed a trust service office of the fiduciary financial institution under
3 K.S.A. 9-2108, and amendments thereto, or a trust facility or out-of-state
4 facility under K.S.A. 9-2111, and amendments thereto, by reason of
5 providing services to a fiduciary financial institution or licensing products,
6 platforms, systems or processes to such fiduciary financial institution.
7 (c) A fiduciary financial institution that provides services or licenses
8 fidfin products or forms pursuant to subsection (a) shall not be deemed a
9 trust service office of the fiduciary financial institution that has acquired
10 such services or licensed such products or forms.
11 (d) If a fiduciary financial institution offers its technology-enabled
12 platform to provide fidfin services to residents of other states, neither the
13 marketing, use and deployment of such platform by parties in other states
14 nor the origination of fidfin services through such platform shall constitute
15 an out-of-state trust facility under K.S.A. 9-2111, and amendments thereto,
16 if the fiduciary financial institution complies with the provisions of K.S.A.
17 9-2309, and amendments thereto.
18 (e) A fiduciary financial institution shall provide notice to the
19 commissioner pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 9-2103(a)(12), and
20 amendments thereto, if such fiduciary financial institution engages a party
21 pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a).
22 (f) Whenever a fiduciary financial institution causes to be performed
23 for such fiduciary financial institution, by contract or otherwise, any
24 service authorized under this act or the state banking code, such
25 performance shall be subject to regulation, supervision and examination by
26 the commissioner to the same extent as if such service was being
27 performed by the fiduciary financial institution itself.
28 Sec. 9. K.S.A. 9-2322 is hereby amended to read as follows: 9-2322.
29 (a) Pursuant to K.S.A. 9-1713, and amendments thereto, the commissioner

34 contracts for technical assistance and professional services as are
35 necessary to administer the provisions of this act and to meet the deadline
36 for the adoption of rules and regulations provided by this section. Such
37 contracts shall be exempt from the requirements of K.S.A. 75-3739, 75-
38 37,102 and 75-37,132, and amendments thereto, or any other statute
39 relating to the procurement of such services.
40 Sec. 10. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,283 is hereby amended to read as
41 follows: 79-32,283. (a) For taxable years commencing after December 31,
42 2020, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax liability of a
43 fiduciary financial institution imposed pursuant to the Kansas income tax

HB 2235 14
1 act or the privilege tax imposed upon a fiduciary financial institution
2 pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
3 amendments thereto, in an amount equal to the qualified charitable
4 distributions made in connection with the fiduciary financial institution's
5 fidfin activities during such taxable year if the fiduciary financial
6 institution maintained such fiduciary financial institution's principal office
7 in an economic growth zone during such taxable year in accordance with
8 the provisions of K.S.A. 9-2309, and amendments thereto.
9 (b) For purposes of this section:

12 (2) "qualified charitable distributions" means distributions of cash,
13 beneficial interests or other assets to one or more qualified charities having
14 an aggregate value equal to at least 2.5% of the fiduciary financial
15 institution's transactions originated during the taxable year. Such
16 transactions shall exclude any renewals, extensions of credit or accruals
17 associated with transactions made in a prior taxable year; and
18 (3) (A) "qualified charities" means one or more:
19 (i) Charities, in to which contributions are allowable as a deduction

13 amendments thereto. Qualified charitable distributions may be made for
14 the benefit of any one or more economic growth zones.
15 (f) If a fiduciary financial institution is a pass-through entity for
16 Kansas tax purposes and the credit allowed by this section for a taxable
17 year is greater than the fiduciary financial institution's tax liability against
18 which the tax credit may be applied, a member of the entity or any other
19 party who is required to report such income on a Kansas income tax return
20 is entitled to a tax credit equal to the tax credit determined for the fiduciary
21 financial institution for the taxable year in excess of the fiduciary financial
22 institution's tax liability under the Kansas income tax act or privilege tax
23 under article 11 of chapter 79 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and
24 amendments thereto, for the taxable year multiplied by the percentage of
25 the fiduciary financial institution's distributive income to which the

27 not be sold, assigned, conveyed or otherwise transferred.
28 (g) If the amount of a tax credit allowed a member or other party
29 under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for the
30 taxable year in which the tax credit is allowed, the amount thereof that
31 exceeds such tax liability may be carried over for deduction from the
32 taxpayer's income or privilege tax liability in the next succeeding taxable
33 year or years until the total amount of the tax credit has been deducted
34 from tax liability, except that no such tax credit shall be carried over for
35 deduction after the 5th taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which
36 the tax credit is first allowed.
37 (h) In any taxable year, a fiduciary financial institution shall pay the
38 greater of the qualified charitable distributions made during such taxable
39 year or the tax liability of a fiduciary financial institution imposed
40 pursuant to the Kansas income tax act or the privilege tax imposed upon a
41 fiduciary financial institution pursuant to article 11 of chapter 79 of the
42 Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto.

3 2312 and 9-2322 and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 9-2301 and 79-32,283 are hereby
