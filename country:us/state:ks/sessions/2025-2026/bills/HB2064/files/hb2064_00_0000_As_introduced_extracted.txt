16 additional waste may be brought to the site following the department's
17 approval of the site cleanup and closure plan.
18 (2) Perform temporary projects to remediate soils contaminated by

28 obtained from the landowner and the local governmental or zoning
29 authority having jurisdiction over the disposal site. The disposal area must
30 be covered with a minimum of two feet of soil and seeded, rocked or

33 tornadoes, floods and fires, or other such emergencies, at temporary waste
34 transfer sites, when a request for storage is made by the local
35 governmental authority having jurisdiction over the area. Authorization
36 shall be granted by the department only when failure to act quickly could
37 jeopardize human health or the environment. Prior to the department's
