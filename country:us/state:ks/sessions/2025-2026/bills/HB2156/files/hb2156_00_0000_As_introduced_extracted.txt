18 time during the tax year on a form prescribed by the department of
19 revenue.
20 (g) (1) The department of revenue may consult with the state
21 department of education only for the purpose of determining whether or

23 credit is enrolled in a public school, as defined in K.S.A. 72-4352, and
24 amendments thereto, during the tax year for which the credit is claimed.
25 (2) By making a claim for the education opportunity tax credit, the

40 amendments thereto.
41 (j) (1) In any legal proceeding challenging the application of this

2 (2) No liability shall arise on the part of the department, the state or
3 any public school or school district based on the award of or use of an
4 education opportunity tax credit pursuant to this section.
5 (3) If any part of this section is challenged in a state court as violating
6 either the state or federal constitutions, taxpayers claiming the education
7 opportunity tax credit shall be permitted to intervene as of right in such
8 lawsuit for the purposes of defending the education opportunity tax credit's

19 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
20 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual

22 with the modifications specified in this section.
23 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:

25 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
26 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
27 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
28 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
29 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
30 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
31 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
32 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
33 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after

35 adjusted gross income whether or not included in federal adjusted gross
36 income.

38 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
39 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not

11 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
12 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as

5 section.

7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
8 New Section 1. (a) For tax year 2025 and all tax years thereafter,
9 there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax liability of a resident
10 individual imposed under the Kansas income tax act an education
11 opportunity tax credit. For each dependent child eligible to enroll in
12 kindergarten or any of the grades one through 12 in a Kansas public school
13 but who was not so enrolled, the education opportunity tax credit shall be
14 as follows:
15 (1) $8,000 for each dependent child enrolled full time during the tax
16 year in a private school accredited by the state board of education or a
17 national or regional accrediting agency that is recognized by the state
18 board for the purpose of satisfying the teaching performance assessment
19 for professional licensure or is working in good faith toward such
20 accreditation; or
21 (2) $4,000 for each dependent child enrolled full time during the tax
22 year in a nonaccredited private school.
23 (b) (1) For tax year 2025, the total amount of credits allowed under
24 this section shall not exceed $125,000,000. For tax year 2026, and all tax
25 years thereafter, the maximum total amount of credits allowed under this
26 section shall be the same amount as the prior tax year, except that for any
27 tax year in which the annual tax credit amount that was used for the prior
28 tax year was equal to or greater than 90% of the maximum total amount of
29 credits allowed for such prior tax year, the maximum total amount of
30 credits shall increase by 25%. The department of revenue shall publish on
31 its website information identifying such increases in the maximum total
32 amount of tax credits.
33 (2) If the number of applications exceeds the available credit, the
34 secretary shall give priority to taxpayers who have previously received a
35 tax credit under this section.

HB 2156 2
1 (c) If the amount of the tax credit allowed by this section exceeds the
2 taxpayer's income tax liability imposed under the Kansas income tax act
3 for such tax year, the excess amount shall be refunded to the taxpayer.
4 (d) A taxpayer shall not receive the education opportunity tax credit if
5 such taxpayer fails to provide a valid social security number issued by the
6 social security administration for each dependent child of the taxpayer for
7 whom the taxpayer is seeking such tax credit.
8 (e) A taxpayer shall not be eligible to claim the education opportunity
9 tax credit for a dependent child for a tax year in which such dependent
10 child received a scholarship pursuant to the tax credit for low income
11 students scholarship program act, K.S.A. 72-4351 et seq., and amendments
12 thereto.
13 (f) The department of revenue shall provide an eligible taxpayer the
14 opportunity to either claim and receive the education opportunity tax credit
15 in advance during the tax year or to claim the tax credit on their annual
16 income tax forms. If the taxpayer chooses to claim the tax credit in
17 advance during the tax year, the taxpayer may file an application at any
18 time during the tax year on a form prescribed by the department of
19 revenue.
20 (g) (1) The department of revenue may consult with the state
21 department of education only for the purpose of determining whether or
22 not a dependent child of a taxpayer claiming an education opportunity tax
23 credit is enrolled in a public school, as defined in K.S.A. 72-4352, and
24 amendments thereto, during the tax year for which the credit is claimed.
25 (2) By making a claim for the education opportunity tax credit, the
26 taxpayer acknowledges that the department of revenue may consult with
27 and receive information from the state department of education regarding
28 the public school enrollment status of any dependent child for whom the
29 tax credit is being claimed.
30 (h) On or before January 15 of each year, the department of revenue
31 shall prepare and submit to the legislature a report on the education
32 opportunity tax credit for the second preceding tax year. Such report shall
33 include, but not be limited to, the total amount of credits claimed and any
34 information on known fraudulent claims for the credit.
35 (i) Any person who intentionally files a false claim for the education
36 opportunity tax credit or receives the education opportunity tax credit but
37 does not send such person's dependent child to a private school as
38 described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) shall be subject to a civil penalty in
39 an amount computed in the manner prescribed in K.S.A. 79-3228(e), and
40 amendments thereto.
41 (j) (1) In any legal proceeding challenging the application of this
42 section to a taxpayer receiving the tax credit, the state bears the burden of
43 establishing that the law is necessary and does not impose any undue

HB 2156 3
1 burden on the on the taxpayer.
2 (2) No liability shall arise on the part of the department, the state or
3 any public school or school district based on the award of or use of an
4 education opportunity tax credit pursuant to this section.
5 (3) If any part of this section is challenged in a state court as violating
6 either the state or federal constitutions, taxpayers claiming the education
7 opportunity tax credit shall be permitted to intervene as of right in such
8 lawsuit for the purposes of defending the education opportunity tax credit's
9 constitutionality. However, for the purposes of judicial administration, a
10 court may require that all taxpayers file a joint brief, so long as they are
11 not required to join any brief filed on behalf of any named state defendant.
12 (4) If any provision of this section, or the application thereof to any
13 person or circumstances, is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect
14 other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect
15 without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions
16 of this section are declared to be severable.
17 (k) This section shall be a part of and supplemental to the Kansas
18 income tax act.
19 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
20 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
21 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
22 with the modifications specified in this section.
23 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:
24 (i) Interest income less any related expenses directly incurred in the
25 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
26 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
27 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
28 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
29 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
30 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
31 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
32 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
33 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after
34 December 31, 1987, shall be excluded from computation of Kansas
35 adjusted gross income whether or not included in federal adjusted gross
36 income.
37 (ii) Taxes on or measured by income or fees or payments in lieu of
38 income taxes imposed by this state or any other taxing jurisdiction to the
39 extent deductible in determining federal adjusted gross income and not
40 credited against federal income tax. This paragraph shall not apply to taxes
41 imposed under the provisions of K.S.A. 79-1107 or 79-1108, and
42 amendments thereto, for privilege tax year 1995, and all such years

4 (iv) Federal income tax refunds received by the taxpayer if the
5 deduction of the taxes being refunded resulted in a tax benefit for Kansas
6 income tax purposes during a prior taxable year. Such refunds shall be
7 included in income in the year actually received regardless of the method
8 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
9 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
10 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
11 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
12 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
13 bears the same proportion to the total refund received as the federal taxes
14 deducted in the year to which such refund is attributable bears to the total
15 federal income taxes paid for such year. For purposes of the foregoing
16 sentence, federal taxes shall be considered to have been deducted only to
17 the extent such deduction does not reduce Kansas taxable income below
18 zero.

20 deduction claimed on the taxpayer's federal income tax return for any

27 (vii) The amount of any charitable contribution made to the extent the
28 same is claimed as the basis for the credit allowed pursuant to K.S.A. 79-
29 32,196, and amendments thereto.
30 (viii) The amount of any costs incurred for improvements to a swine
31 facility, claimed for deduction in determining federal adjusted gross

35 the amount of any costs incurred for habitat management or construction

39 and amendments thereto.
40 (x) Amounts received as nonqualified withdrawals, as defined by
41 K.S.A. 75-643, and amendments thereto, if, at the time of contribution to a

10 the federal adjusted gross income pursuant to subsection (c)(xiii), or if
11 such amounts are not already included in the federal adjusted gross
12 income.
