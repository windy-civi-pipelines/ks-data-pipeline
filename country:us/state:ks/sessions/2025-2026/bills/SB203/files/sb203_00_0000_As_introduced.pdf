6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 22-2805 is hereby amended to read as follows: 22-
8 2805. (a) If it appears by affidavit that the testimony of a person is material
9 in any criminal proceeding or in any proceeding under the revised Kansas
10 juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301 et seq., and amendments thereto, and
11 it is shown that it may become impracticable to secure the witness'
12 presence by subpoena, the court or magistrate may:
13 (1) Require the witness to give bond in an amount fixed by the court
14 or magistrate, or to comply with other conditions to assure the witness'
15 appearance as a witness. If a person fails to comply with the conditions of
16 release, the court or magistrate may, after hearing, commit the witness to
17 the custody of the sheriff or marshal pending final disposition of the
18 proceeding in which the testimony is needed. A material witness shall not
19 be held in custody more than 30 days unless the court or magistrate, after
20 hearing, determines that there is good cause to hold the witness for an
21 additional period of not more than 30 days. No material witness shall be
22 detained because of inability to comply with any condition of release if the
23 testimony of the witness can be secured for use at trial or in any
24 proceeding under the revised Kansas juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301
25 et seq., and amendments thereto by deposition, and further detention is not
26 necessary to prevent a failure of justice. Release may be delayed for a
27 reasonable time until the deposition of the witness can be taken pursuant to
28 K.S.A. 22-3211, and amendments thereto; or
29 (2) if the person was personally served with a subpoena, issue a
30 notice to appear to answer to a charge of indirect contempt of court
31 pursuant to K.S.A. 20-1204a, and amendments thereto. Upon appearing,
32 the court may continue such charge for the duration of the proceeding for
33 which the subpoena was issued and order the witness to comply with any
34 condition that the court may impose to secure the witness' appearance.
35 (b) The court or magistrate shall appoint counsel to represent a
36 witness committed to custody pursuant to this section subsection (a)(1)

SB 203 2
1 when the court or magistrate determines that the witness is financially
2 unable to employ counsel, based on the same standards as used to
3 determine if a defendant is able to employ counsel. Such appointment shall
4 be from the panel for indigents' defense services or as otherwise prescribed
5 under the applicable system for providing legal defense services for
6 indigent persons prescribed by the state board of indigents' defense

8 revised Kansas juvenile justice code, K.S.A. 38-2301 et seq., and
9 amendments thereto, such appointment shall be pursuant to K.S.A. 38-
10 2306, and amendments thereto. The witness may obtain necessary
11 investigative, expert and other services in the manner provided by K.S.A.
12 22-4508, and amendments thereto. Payment for the counsel and other
13 services shall be made in the manner provided by K.S.A. 22-4507, and

7 neglect of such party,; or
