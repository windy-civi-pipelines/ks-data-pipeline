9 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 74-50,223 is hereby amended to read as
10 follows: 74-50,223. (a) Any county that has been designated a rural
11 opportunity zone pursuant to K.S.A. 74-50,222, and amendments thereto,
12 may participate in the program provided in this section by authorizing such
13 participation by the county commission of such county through a duly
14 enacted written resolution. Such county shall provide a certified copy of
15 such resolution to the secretary of commerce on or before January 1, 2012,
16 for calendar year 2012, or on or before January 1 for each calendar year
17 thereafter, in which a county chooses to participate. Such resolution shall
18 obligate the county to participate in the program provided by this section
19 for a period of five years, and shall be irrevocable. Such resolution shall
20 specify the maximum amount of outstanding student loan balance for each
21 resident individual to be repaid as provided in subsection (b), except that
22 the maximum amount of such balance shall be $15,000.
23 (b) If a county submits a resolution as provided in subsection (a),
24 under the program provided in this section, subject to subsection (d), the
25 state of Kansas and such county which that chooses to participate as
26 provided in subsection (a), shall agree to pay in equal shares the
27 outstanding student loan balance of any resident individual who qualifies
28 to have such individual's student loans repaid under the provisions of
29 subsection (c) over a five-year period, except that the maximum amount of
30 such balance shall be $15,000. The amount of such repayment shall be
31 equal to 20% of the outstanding student loan balance of the individual in a
32 year over the five-year repayment period. The state of Kansas is not
33 obligated to pay the student loan balance of any resident individual who
34 qualifies pursuant to subsection (c) prior to the county submitting a
35 resolution to the secretary pursuant to subsection (a). Each such county
36 shall certify to the secretary that such county has made the payment

SB 69—Am. by SC 2
1 required by this subsection.
2 (c) Except as provided in subsection (h), a resident individual shall
3 be entitled to have such individual's outstanding student loan balance paid
4 for attendance at an institution of higher education where such resident
5 individual earned an associate, bachelor or post-graduate degree under the
6 provisions of this section when such resident individual establishes
7 domicile in a county designated as a rural opportunity zone which that
8 participates in the program as provided in subsection (a), on and after the
9 date in which such county commenced such participation, and prior to July
10 1, 2026 2031. Such resident individual may enroll in this program in a
11 form and manner prescribed by the secretary. Subject to subsection (d),
12 once enrolled such resident individual shall be entitled to full participation
13 in the program for five years, except that if the resident individual
14 relocates outside the rural opportunity zone for which the resident
15 individual first qualified, such resident individual forfeits such individual's
16 eligibility to participate, and obligations under this section of the state and
17 the county terminate. No resident individual shall enroll and be eligible to
18 participate in this program after June 30, 2026 2031.
19 (d) The provisions of this act shall be subject to appropriation acts.
20 Nothing in this act guarantees a resident individual a right to the benefits
21 provided in this section. The county may continue to participate even if the
22 state does not participate.
23 (e) (1) Commencing on January 1, 2026, the rural opportunity zone
24 program shall include two additional benefit options: (A) Down payment
25 assistance; and (B) child care reimbursement. Any county that meets the
26 definition of a rural opportunity zone pursuant to K.S.A. 74-50,222, and
27 amendments thereto, may participate in the program benefits provided in
28 this subsection by authorizing such participation by the county
29 commission of such county through a duly enacted written resolution.
30 Such county shall provide a certified copy of such resolution to the
31 secretary of commerce on or before January 1, 2026, for calendar year
32 2026, or on or before January 1 for each calendar year thereafter, in
33 which a county chooses to participate in one or both of the benefits.
34 Such resolution shall be irrevocable and shall obligate the county to
35 participate in the child care reimbursement provided by this subsection
36 for a period of five years if the county participates in such benefit. Such
37 resolution shall specify the maximum amount of down payment
38 assistance or child care reimbursement for each resident individual to be
39 paid as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), except that the maximum
40 amount of each such benefit shall not exceed $15,000.
41 (2) If a county submits a resolution to participate in the down
42 payment assistance benefit as provided in paragraph (1), subject to
43 subsection (d), the state of Kansas and such county shall agree to

SB 69—Am. by SC 3
1 contribute to the down payment, in equal shares, an amount of up to 3%
2 of the purchase price for the purchase of a residence within such county
3 by a resident individual who qualifies under subsection (f) and is a first-
4 time homebuyer, except that the maximum amount of such down
5 payment assistance shall not exceed $15,000. The state of Kansas is not
6 obligated to pay a portion of the down payment of any resident
7 individual who qualifies pursuant to subsection (f) prior to the county
8 submitting a resolution to the secretary pursuant to subsection (e). Each
9 such county shall certify to the secretary that such county has made the
10 payment required by this paragraph.
11 (3) If a county submits a resolution to participate in the child care
12 reimbursement benefit as provided in paragraph (1), subject to
13 subsection (d), the state of Kansas and such county shall agree to pay in
14 equal shares reimbursement of child care expenses paid for a dependent
15 child or children during the year by a resident individual who qualifies
16 under the provisions of subsection (f), except that the maximum amount
17 of such reimbursement shall not exceed $15,000 over a five-year period,
18 or $3,000 per year. The state of Kansas is not obligated to pay a portion
19 of the reimbursement of any resident individual who qualifies pursuant
20 to subsection (f) prior to the county submitting a resolution to the
21 secretary pursuant to subsection (e). Each such county shall certify to
22 the secretary that such county has made the payment required by this
23 paragraph.
24 (f) Except as provided in subsection (h), a resident individual shall
25 be entitled to down payment assistance or child care reimbursement
26 under the provisions of this section if such resident individual
27 establishes domicile in a county designated as a rural opportunity zone
28 that participates in the program as provided in subsection (e) on and
29 after the date that such county commenced such participation and prior
30 to July 1, 2031. Such resident individual may enroll in this program in a
31 form and manner prescribed by the secretary. Subject to subsection (d),
32 once enrolled, such resident individual enrolled in the child care
33 reimbursement benefit shall be entitled to full participation in the
34 program for five years, except that if the resident individual relocates
35 outside the rural opportunity zone for which the resident individual first
36 qualified, such resident individual forfeits such individual's eligibility to
37 participate, and obligations under this section of the state and the county
38 terminate. No resident individual shall enroll and be eligible to
39 participate in this program after June 30, 2031.
40 (g) The county's share of any benefit pursuant to this section may
41 be paid by the county, the employer of the individual, any municipality
42 or political subdivision within the county or any other organization,
43 business, group or individual, or any combination thereof, if so

SB 69—Am. by SC 4
1 authorized by the county.
2 (h) A county may participate in one, two or all three of the program
3 benefits pursuant to subsections (a) and (e), but an eligible resident
4 individual may only receive benefits pursuant to one such program
5 benefits offered by the county.
6 (i) The secretary shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to
7 administer the provisions of this section.
8 (f)(j) On January 1, 2012, and annually thereafter until January 1,
9 2027 2032, the secretary of commerce shall report to the senate committee
10 on assessment and taxation and the house of representatives committee on
11 taxation as to how many residents applied for the rural opportunity zone
12 tax credit.
