22 county treasurer shall be required to pay the tax from the date the request
23 is filed with the county appraiser until the expiration of 30 days after the

25 event that taxes have been assessed against the subject property, no interest
26 shall accrue on any unpaid tax for the year or years in question nor shall
27 the unpaid tax be considered delinquent from the date the request is filed
28 with the county appraiser until the expiration of 30 days after the board
29 issued its order thereon. In the event the board determines an application
30 for exemption is without merit and filed in bad faith to delay the due date
31 of the tax, the tax shall be considered delinquent as of the date the tax
32 would have been due pursuant to K.S.A. 79-2004 and 79-2004a, and
33 amendments thereto, and interest shall accrue as prescribed therein.
34 (j) In the event the board grants the initial request for exemption, the
