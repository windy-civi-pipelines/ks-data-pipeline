10 Sec. 3. K.S.A. 40-2,118 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
11 2,118. (a) For purposes of this act, a "fraudulent insurance act" means an
12 act committed by any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud,
13 presents, causes to be presented or prepares with knowledge or belief that
14 it will be presented to or by an insurer, purported insurer, broker or any
15 agent thereof, or the Kansas automobile assigned claims plan, any written,
16 electronic, electronic impulse, facsimile, magnetic, oral, or telephonic
17 communication or statement as part of, or in support of, an application for
18 the issuance of, or the rating of an insurance policy for personal or
19 commercial insurance, or a claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to
20 an insurance policy for commercial or personal insurance or automobile
21 assigned claims plan that such person knows to contain materially false
22 information concerning any fact material thereto; or conceals, for the
23 purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.
24 (b) An insurer or automobile assigned claims plan that has
25 knowledge or a good faith belief that a fraudulent insurance act is being or
26 has been committed shall provide to the commissioner, on a form
27 prescribed by the commissioner, any and all information and such
28 additional information relating to such fraudulent insurance act as the
29 commissioner may require.
30 (c) Any other person who has knowledge or a good faith belief that a
31 fraudulent insurance act is being or has been committed may provide to
32 the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, any and all
33 information and such additional information relating to such fraudulent
34 insurance act as the commissioner may request.
35 (d) (1) Each insurer and automobile assigned claims plan shall have
36 antifraud initiatives reasonably calculated to detect fraudulent insurance
37 acts. Antifraud initiatives may include fraud investigators, who may be
38 insurer employees or independent contractors and an antifraud plan
39 submitted to the commissioner not later than July 1, 2007. Each insurer
40 and automobile assigned claims plan that submits an antifraud plan shall
41 notify the commissioner of any material change in the information
42 contained in the antifraud plan within 30 days after such change occurs.
43 Such insurer or automobile assigned claims plan shall submit to the

HB 2323—Am. by HC 12
1 commissioner in writing the amended antifraud plan.
2 (2) Any antifraud plan, or any amendment thereof, submitted to the
3 commissioner for informational purposes only shall be confidential and
4 not be a public record and shall not be subject to discovery or subpoena in
5 a civil action unless following an in camera review, the court determines
6 that the antifraud plan is relevant and otherwise admissible under the rules
7 of evidence set forth in article 4 of chapter 60 of the Kansas Statutes
8 Annotated, and amendments thereto.
9 (e) Except as otherwise specifically provided in K.S.A. 44-5,125, and
10 amendments thereto, and K.S.A. 21-5812(a), and amendments thereto, a
11 fraudulent insurance act shall constitute a severity level 6, nonperson
12 felony if the amount involved is $25,000 or more; a severity level 7,
13 nonperson felony if the amount involved is at least $5,000 but less than
14 $25,000; a severity level 8, nonperson felony if the amount involved is at
15 least $1,000 but less than $5,000; and a class C nonperson misdemeanor if
16 the amount involved is less than $1,000. Any combination of fraudulent
17 acts as defined in subsection (a) that occur in a period of six consecutive
18 months and that involve $25,000 or more shall have a presumptive
19 sentence of imprisonment regardless of its location on the sentencing grid
20 block.
21 (f) In addition to any other penalty, a person who violates this statute
22 shall be ordered to make restitution to the insurer or any other person or
23 entity for any financial loss sustained as a result of such violation. An
24 insurer shall not be required to provide coverage or pay any claim
25 involving a fraudulent insurance act.
26 (g) For the purposes of this section:
27 (1) "Amount involved" means the greater of: (A) The actual
28 pecuniary harm resulting from the fraudulent insurance act; (B) the
29 pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the fraudulent insurance
30 act; or (C) the intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible
31 or unlikely to occur, such as in a government sting operation or a fraud in
32 which the claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to an insurance
33 policy exceeded the allowed value. The aggregate dollar amount of the
34 fraudulent claims submitted to the insurance company shall constitute
35 prima facie evidence of the amount of intended loss and is sufficient to
36 establish the aggregate amount involved in the fraudulent insurance act, if
37 not rebutted; and
38 (2) "pecuniary harm" means harm that is monetary or that otherwise
39 is readily measurable in money, and does not include emotional distress,
40 harm to reputation or other non-economic harm.
41 (h) This act shall apply to all insurance applications, ratings, claims
42 and other benefits made pursuant to any insurance policy or automobile
43 assigned claims plan.

HB 2323—Am. by HC 13
1 Sec. 4. K.S.A. 40-2,119 is hereby amended to read as follows: 40-
2 2,119. In the absence of fraud, bad faith or malice, no person or, insurer or
3 automobile assigned claims plan shall be subject to civil liability for libel,
4 slander or any other relevant cause of action:
5 (a) For filing reports or furnishing other information required by
6 chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto, or
7 required by the commissioner under the authority granted in chapter 40 of
8 the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
9 (b) for any information relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts
10 furnished to or received from law enforcement officials, their agents and
11 employees;
12 (c) for any information relating to suspected fraudulent insurance acts
13 furnished to or received from other persons subject to the provisions of
14 chapter 40 of the Kansas Statutes Annotated, and amendments thereto;
15 (d) for any such information furnished in reports to the insurance
16 department, regulatory agencies of any other state, the national association
17 of insurance commissioners or any organization established to detect and
18 prevent fraudulent insurance acts, their agents, employees or designees; or
19 (e) for the publication of any report or bulletin related to the official
20 activities of the insurance department by the commissioner or any
21 employee of the insurance department. Nothing herein is intended to
22 abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or
23 immunity heretofore enjoyed by any person.
24 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 21-6614, 40-2,118 and 40-2,119 are hereby repealed.
25 Sec. 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
26 publication in the statute book.
