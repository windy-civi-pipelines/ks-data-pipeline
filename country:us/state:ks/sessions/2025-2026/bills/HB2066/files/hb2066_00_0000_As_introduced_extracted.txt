40 local official in this state shall attempt to independently determine whether

42 the United States. Such determination shall only be made by verifying the
43 alien's employment authorization status with the federal government
HB 2066 4

40 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
41 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
42 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
43 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the
HB 2066 6

6 agency may assist in investigating a complaint. When investigating a
7 complaint, the county or district attorney or attorney general shall verify
8 the employment authorization of the alleged unauthorized alien with the

22 unauthorized alien in this state. If the business entity fails to file a signed

40 local official in this state shall attempt to independently determine whether
41 an individual is an unauthorized alien or an alien not lawfully present in
42 the United States. Such determination shall only be made by verifying the
43 alien's employment authorization status with the federal government

HB 2066 4
1 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c).
2 (2) When making a determination of whether an employee is an
3 unauthorized alien, a court shall only consider the federal government's
4 determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c). The court shall take judicial
5 notice of any verification of the employment authorization status
6 previously provided by the federal government. The court may, and at the
7 request of a party shall, request the federal government to provide a new
8 verification of the employment authorization status of the employee
9 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1373(c). The most recent determination of the
10 employment authorization status of an employee by the federal
11 government shall create a rebuttable presumption as to the employee's
12 employment authorization status.

18 utilizing e-verify to verify the employment authorization of all new

33 Sec. 5. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-32,117 is hereby amended to read as
34 follows: 79-32,117. (a) The Kansas adjusted gross income of an individual
35 means such individual's federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year,
36 with the modifications specified in this section.
37 (b) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income:

39 purchase of state or political subdivision obligations, to the extent that the
40 same is not included in federal adjusted gross income, on obligations of
41 any state or political subdivision thereof, but to the extent that interest
42 income on obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued
43 prior to January 1, 1988, is specifically exempt from income tax under the

HB 2066 6
1 laws of this state authorizing the issuance of such obligations, it shall be
2 excluded from computation of Kansas adjusted gross income whether or
3 not included in federal adjusted gross income. Interest income on
4 obligations of this state or a political subdivision thereof issued after

22 of accounting used by the taxpayer. For purposes hereof, a tax benefit shall
23 be deemed to have resulted if the amount of the tax had been deducted in
24 determining income subject to a Kansas income tax for a prior year
25 regardless of the rate of taxation applied in such prior year to the Kansas
26 taxable income, but only that portion of the refund shall be included as
