5
6 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
7 Section 1. K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 25-1122 is hereby amended to read as
8 follows: 25-1122. (a) Any registered voter may file with the county
9 election officer where such person is a resident, or where such person is
10 authorized by law to vote as a former precinct resident, an application for
11 an advance voting ballot. The signed application shall be transmitted only
12 to the county election officer by personal delivery, mail, facsimile or as
13 otherwise provided by law.
14 (b) If the registered voter is applying for an advance voting ballot to
15 be transmitted in person, the voter shall provide identification pursuant to
16 K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto.
17 (c) If the registered voter is applying for an advance voting ballot to
18 be transmitted by mail, the voter shall provide with the application for an
19 advance voting ballot the voter's current and valid Kansas driver's license
20 number, nondriver's identification card number or a photocopy of any
21 other identification provided by K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto.
22 (d) A voter may vote a provisional ballot according to K.S.A. 25-409,
23 and amendments thereto, if:
24 (1) The voter is unable or refuses to provide current and valid
25 identification; or
26 (2) the name and address of the voter provided on the application for
27 an advance voting ballot do not match the voter's name and address on the
28 registration book. The voter shall provide a valid form of identification as
29 defined in K.S.A. 25-2908, and amendments thereto, to the county election
30 officer in person or provide a copy by mail or electronic means before the
31 meeting of the county board of canvassers. At the meeting of the county
32 board of canvassers the county election officer shall present copies of
33 identification received from provisional voters and the corresponding
34 provisional ballots. If the county board of canvassers determines that a
35 voter's identification is valid and the provisional ballot was properly cast,
36 the ballot shall be counted.

SB 231 2
1 (e) No county election officer shall provide an advance voting ballot
2 to a person who is requesting an advance voting ballot to be transmitted by
3 mail unless:
4 (1) The county election official verifies that the signature of the
5 person matches that on file in the county voter registration records, except
6 that verification of the voter's signature shall not be required if a voter has
7 a disability preventing the voter from signing. Signature verification may
8 occur by electronic device or by human inspection. In the event that the
9 signature of a person who is requesting an advance voting ballot does not
10 match that on file, the county election officer shall attempt to contact the
11 person and shall offer the person another opportunity to provide the
12 person's signature for the purposes of verifying the person's identity. If the
13 county election officer is unable to reach the person, the county election
14 officer may transmit a provisional ballot, however, such provisional ballot
15 may not be counted unless a signature is included therewith that can be
16 verified; and
17 (2) the person provides such person's full Kansas driver's license
18 number, Kansas nondriver's identification card number issued by the
19 division of vehicles, or submits such person's application for an advance
20 voting ballot and a copy of identification provided by K.S.A. 25-2908, and
21 amendments thereto, to the county election officer for verification. If a
22 person applies for an advance voting ballot to be transmitted by mail but
23 fails to provide identification pursuant to this subsection or the
24 identification of the person cannot be verified by the county election
25 officer, the county election officer shall provide information to the person
26 regarding the voter rights provisions of subsection (d) and shall provide
27 the person an opportunity to provide identification pursuant to this
28 subsection. For the purposes of this act, Kansas state offices and offices of
29 any subdivision of the state will allow any person seeking to vote by an
30 advance voting ballot the use of a photocopying device to make one
31 photocopy of an identification document at no cost.
32 (f) (1) Applications for advance voting ballots to be transmitted to the
33 voter by mail shall be filed only at the following times:
34 (A) For the primary election occurring on the first Tuesday in August
35 in both even-numbered and odd-numbered years, between April 1 of such
36 year and the Tuesday of the week preceding such primary election;
37 (B) for the general election occurring on the Tuesday following the
38 first Monday in November in both even-numbered and odd-numbered
39 years, between 90 days prior to such election and the Tuesday of the week
40 preceding such general election;
41 (C) for the presidential preference primary election held pursuant to
42 K.S.A. 25-4501a, and amendments thereto, between January 1 of the year
43 in which such election is held and 30 days prior to the day of such

SB 231 3

5 (E) for question submitted elections not occurring on the date of a
6 primary or general election, between the time of the first published notice
7 thereof and the Tuesday of the week preceding such question submitted
8 election, except that if the question submitted election is held on a day
9 other than a Tuesday, the final date for mailing of advance voting ballots
10 shall be one week before such election; and
11 (F) for any special election of officers, at such time as is specified by
12 the secretary of state.
13 (2) The county election officer of any county may receive
14 applications prior to the time specified in this subsection and hold such
15 applications until the beginning of the prescribed application period. Such
16 applications shall be treated as filed on that date.
17 (g) (1) Unless an earlier date is designated by the county election
18 office, applications for advance voting ballots transmitted to the voter in
19 person shall be filed on the Tuesday next preceding the election and on
20 each subsequent business day until no later than 12* noon on the day
21 preceding such election. If the county election officer so provides,
22 applications for advance voting ballots transmitted to the voter in person in
23 the office of the county election officer also may be filed on the Saturday
24 preceding the election. Upon receipt of any such properly executed
25 application, the county election officer shall deliver to the voter such
26 ballots and instructions as are provided for in this act.
27 (2) An application for an advance voting ballot filed by a voter who
28 has a temporary illness or disability or who is not proficient in reading the
29 English language or by a person rendering assistance to such voter may be
30 filed during the regular advance ballot application periods until the close
31 of the polls on election day.
32 (3) The county election officer may designate places other than the
33 central county election office as satellite advance voting sites. At any
34 satellite advance voting site, a registered voter may obtain an application
35 for advance voting ballots. Ballots and instructions shall be delivered to
36 the voter in the same manner and subject to the same limitations as
37 otherwise provided by this subsection.
38 (h) Any person having a permanent disability or an illness that has
39 been diagnosed as a permanent illness is hereby authorized to make an
40 application for permanent advance voting status. Applications for
41 permanent advance voting status shall be in the form and contain such
42 information as is required for application for advance voting ballots and
43 also shall contain information that establishes the voter's right to

SB 231 4
1 permanent advance voting status.
2 (i) On receipt of any application filed under the provisions of this
3 section, the county election officer shall prepare and maintain in such
4 officer's office a list of the names of all persons who have filed such
5 applications, together with their correct post office address and the
6 precinct, ward, township or voting area in which the persons claim to be
7 registered voters or to be authorized by law to vote as former precinct
8 residents and the present resident address of each applicant. Names and
9 addresses shall remain so listed until the day of such election. The county
10 election officer shall maintain a separate listing of the names and addresses
11 of persons qualifying for permanent advance voting status. All such lists
12 shall be available for inspection upon request in compliance with this
13 subsection by any registered voter during regular business hours. The
14 county election officer upon receipt of the applications shall enter upon a
15 record kept by such officer the name and address of each applicant, which
16 record shall conform to the list above required. Before inspection of any

18 inspection shall provide to the county election officer identification in the
19 form of driver's license or other reliable identification and shall sign a log
20 book or application form maintained by the officer stating the person's
21 name and address and showing the date and time of inspection. All records
22 made by the county election officer shall be subject to public inspection,

25 records of such numbers shall not be made public.
26 (j) If a person on the permanent advance voting list fails to vote in
27 four consecutive general elections, the county election officer may mail a

29 will be removed from the permanent advance voting list unless the voter
30 renews the application for permanent advance voting status within 30 days
31 after the notice is mailed. If the voter fails to renew such application, the
32 county election officer shall remove the voter's name from the permanent
33 advance voting list. Failure to renew the application for permanent
34 advance voting status shall not result in removal of the voter's name from
35 the voter registration list.
36 (k) (1) Any person who solicits by mail a registered voter to file an
37 application for an advance voting ballot and includes an application for an
38 advance voting ballot in such mailing shall include on the exterior of such
