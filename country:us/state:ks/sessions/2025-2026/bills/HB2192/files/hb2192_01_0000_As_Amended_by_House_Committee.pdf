30 person misdemeanor and the offender shall be sentenced to not less than
31 48 consecutive hours nor more than six months' imprisonment and fined
32 not less than $200, nor more than $500 or in the court's discretion the court
33 may enter an order which requires the offender to undergo a domestic
34 violence offender assessment conducted by a certified batterer intervention
35 program and follow all recommendations made by such program. As a

HB 2192—Am. by HC 2
1 condition of any grant of probation, suspension of sentence or parole
2 or of any other release, the offender shall be required to undergo a
3 domestic violence offender assessment conducted by a certified
4 batterer intervention program and follow all recommendations made
5 by such program, unless otherwise ordered by the court;
6 (B) except as provided in subsection (c)(1)(C), a class A person
7 misdemeanor, if, within five years immediately preceding commission of
8 the crime, an offender is convicted of domestic battery a second time and
9 the offender shall be sentenced to not less than 90 days nor more than one
10 year's imprisonment and fined not less than $500 nor more than $1,000.
11 The five 90 days' imprisonment mandated by this paragraph may be served
12 in a work release program only after such offender has served 48 45
13 consecutive hours' days' imprisonment, provided if such work release
14 program requires such offender to return to confinement at the end of each
15 day in the work release program. The offender shall serve at least five 45
16 consecutive days' imprisonment before the offender is granted probation,
17 suspension or reduction of sentence or parole or is otherwise released. As a
18 condition of any grant of probation, suspension of sentence or parole or of
19 any other release, the offender shall be required to undergo a domestic
20 violence offender assessment conducted by a certified batterer intervention
21 program and follow all recommendations made by such program, unless
22 otherwise ordered by the court; and
23 (C) a person felony, if, within five years immediately preceding
24 commission of the crime, an offender is convicted of domestic battery a
25 third or subsequent time, and the offender shall be sentenced to not less
26 than 90 days nor more than one year's imprisonment and fined not less
27 than $1,000 nor more than $7,500. The offender convicted shall not be
28 eligible for release on probation, suspension or reduction of sentence or
29 parole until the offender has served at least 90 days' imprisonment shall
30 serve at least 90 consecutive days' imprisonment before the offender is
31 granted probation, suspension or reduction of sentence or parole or is
32 otherwise released. As a condition of any grant of probation, suspension of
33 sentence or parole or of any other release, the offender shall be required to
34 undergo a domestic violence offender assessment conducted by a certified
35 batterer intervention program and follow all recommendations made by
36 such program, unless otherwise ordered by the court. If the offender does
37 not undergo a domestic violence offender assessment conducted by a
38 certified batterer intervention program and follow all recommendations
39 made by such program, the offender shall serve not less than 180 days nor
40 more than one year's imprisonment. The 90 days' imprisonment mandated
41 by this paragraph may be served in a work release program only after such
42 offender has served 48 consecutive hours imprisonment, provided such
43 work release program requires such offender to return to confinement at
