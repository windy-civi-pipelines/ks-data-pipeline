annual registration fee due for any truck or truck tractor subject to
registration on January 1, and for which the owner shall be liable, but
relate only to an alternate method of payment of the amount of fees due
and affixed as of January 1 of each year. If any owner shall default in
the payment of any quarterly installment payment when the same is
payable, the right to operate such vehicle on the highways of this state
shall terminate and it shall be unlawful to operate such vehicle on the
highways of this state until the delinquent quarterly installment
payment plus any penalty, shall have been paid in full.
(d) (1) If any owner shall fail to pay any two quarterly payment
installments during any one registration year on any truck or truck
tractor registered hereunder, on or before the day the same are due and
payable, such owner thereafter may be denied the privilege of the
payment of annual registration fees on a quarterly basis on any vehicle.
If a quarterly installment payment shall be delinquent more than 10
days beyond the due date of such quarterly installment, except for any
case where it is determined by the director of vehicles that such
delinquency is not due to negligence or intentional disregard of the
provisions of this section, then the entire balance of the annual
registration fee, including the delinquent quarterly installment, plus a
penalty in a sum equal to 10% of the annual registration fee, shall
become due and payable; and. Any such owner so delinquent may
thereafter be denied the privilege of the payment of annual registration
fees on any vehicle on a quarterly basis. All such fees and penalties
remaining unpaid shall constitute a debt due the state, which may be
collected from the person owing the same such unpaid fees and
penalties by suit or otherwise. All such fees and any penalties
remaining unpaid after the same such fees and any penalties are due
and payable and any penalties shall constitute a first and prior lien in
favor of the state upon the truck or truck tractor registered hereunder
under this section, and all other real and personal property of the owner
located within the state in the amount such fees and penalties remain
unpaid. Each lien shall attach at the time such unpaid fees and penalties
accrue and shall be paramount to all prior liens or encumbrances of any

HOUSE BILL No. 2122—page 9
character and to the rights of any holder of the legal title in or to any
such truck or truck tractor.
(2) When a quarterly installment is delinquent more than 10 days
beyond the due date, upon default of such installment payment, the
county treasurer shall promptly file a notice of lien in the office of the
register of deeds of the county where the registration fee is payable, and
in any other county in which such owner has any property. A copy of
such notice of lien shall be mailed to the division of vehicles, and the
owner so delinquent, and the sheriff of any county in which such notice
of lien is filed. Such notice of lien shall set forth the name and address
of the owner, the amount of fees and penalties payable and unpaid, and
the description of the vehicle or vehicles to which applicable to such
notice of lien. It shall be the duty of each register of deeds in this state
to index and file immediately all such notices of lien in the manner
provided in cases of financing statements and no fee shall be charged
for filing and indexing.
(3) The county treasurer shall issue a release of lien upon payment
of all fees and penalties payable by such owner and such person may
file the same with the register of deeds of any county in which such
notice of lien has been filed. The county treasurer shall mail a copy of
the release of lien to the division, and to the sheriff of any county where
said such notice of lien has been filed.
(4) If a quarterly installment payment shall be delinquent more
than 10 days beyond the due date of such quarterly installment, the
division, shall promptly on such default and the filing of the notice of
lien issue a tax warrant to the sheriff of any county in which such
notice of lien has been filed and may thereafter issue further warrants
as may be necessary, and. Such sheriff shall seize and hold all personal
property subject thereto to such lien and proceed to advertise and sell
the same such property or so much thereof as may be necessary, to
satisfy the state's lien, together with all expense of selling at public sale
for cash, upon such notice as is provided by law in the case of a
security agreement sale.
(5) Any surplus of the proceeds of such sale, after paying to the
county treasurer, the amount of the state's lien, and the cost of the
officer in giving notice of and executing said such warrant computed to
the same extent as in judicial sales on execution, and of securing and
preserving the property pending such sale, shall be delivered to the
person lawfully entitled thereto to such surplus amount. In the event
that any truck or truck tractor for which the annual registration fee is
being paid quarterly shall be sold or otherwise disposed of, the entire
balance remaining unpaid on such annual registration fee shall become
immediately due and payable.
(6) No certificate of title shall be assigned or transferred or new
certificate of title be issued for such vehicle until all the registration
fees and penalties are paid in full. In the event such vehicle shall be
repossessed by the enforcement of a lien or security interest on the
same such vehicle, during any quarterly period for which the
registration fees have not been paid, the person repossessing such
vehicle or the person purchasing such vehicle at a repossession sale,
may acquire a new certificate of title upon the payment of a fee equal to
1/ of the annual registration fee of the vehicle registered hereunder
4
under this section, plus the regular fee prescribed by law for certificate
of title. If any truck or truck tractor which that is registered under the
provisions of this subsection section is exchanged or traded by the
owner thereof for another truck or truck tractor, any registration fee and
any quarterly installments which that have been paid shall be applied to
the registration fee due for the registration of the newly acquired
vehicle. The application of any such registration fee or quarterly
installment to the newly acquired vehicle shall not affect or reduce the
original amount of the annual registration fee or any quarterly
installment payment, for which such owner was originally liable.
(e) The division of vehicles may call to its aid the state highway
patrol or any peace officer or any duly appointed representative of the

HOUSE BILL No. 2122—page 10
department to enforce the provisions of this section within their
respective jurisdiction and it shall be the duty of such officers to do so.
The remedies for enforcement and collection provided in this section
are cumulative and the use of one shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
the right to use any other.
Sec. 3. On and after January 1, 2026, K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 8-145 is
hereby amended to read as follows: 8-145. (a) All registration and

incidental to the administration of the duties of the county treasurer in
accordance with the provisions of this act, shall not exceed the amount

fund, except as provided in subsection (d).
