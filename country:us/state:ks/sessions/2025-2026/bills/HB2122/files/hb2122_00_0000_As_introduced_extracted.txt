7
8 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Kansas:
9 Section 1. K.S.A. 8-143a is hereby amended to read as follows: 8-
10 143a. (a) The provisions of this section shall not apply to vehicles
11 registered on an apportioned basis as part of a fleet under the provisions of
12 K.S.A. 8-1,101 to through 8-1,123, inclusive, and amendments thereto, or
13 any agreement made by the director of vehicles, and. The payment of
14 registration fees on a quarterly basis on such vehicles shall be in
15 accordance with K.S.A. 8-1,115, and amendments thereto.
16 (b) A resident owner of any truck or truck tractor, holding a
17 negotiable Kansas title, whether individual, partnership or Kansas
18 corporation, may at such owner's election, made at the time the annual
19 registration fee on such truck or truck tractor is payable, pay such annual
20 registration fee if it such fee exceeds $100 $300, in equal quarterly
21 installments,. The first of which such quarterly payments shall be payable
22 at the time of such application but not later than the last day of February in
23 each year, and for each ensuing quarter thereafter shall be payable
24 respectively on the first day of April, July and October. The applicant
25 shall, at the time of registration, present such applicant's negotiable Kansas
26 title to the county treasurer, who shall send it, along with the application
27 for registration, to the division of vehicles. The division of vehicles shall
28 retain the title until all quarterly payments are paid in full, at which time
29 the title shall be returned to the owner of the vehicle to which the title was
30 issued.
31 (c) The provisions of the preceding paragraph subsection (b) shall not
32 in any manner be construed to affect or reduce the amount of annual
33 registration fee due for any truck or truck tractor subject to registration on
34 January 1, and for which the owner shall be liable, but relate only to an
35 alternate method of payment of the amount of fees due and affixed as of
HB 2122 2
1 January 1 of each year. If any owner shall default in the payment of any
2 quarterly installment payment when the same is payable, the right to
3 operate such vehicle on the highways of this state shall terminate and it
4 shall be unlawful to operate such vehicle on the highways of this state until
5 the delinquent quarterly installment payment plus any penalty, shall have
6 been paid in full.
7 (d) (1) If any owner shall fail to pay any two quarterly payment
8 installments during any one registration year on any truck or truck tractor
9 registered hereunder, on or before the day the same are due and payable,
10 such owner thereafter may be denied the privilege of the payment of
11 annual registration fees on a quarterly basis on any vehicle. If a quarterly
12 installment payment shall be delinquent more than 10 days beyond the due
13 date of such quarterly installment, except for any case where it is
14 determined by the director of vehicles that such delinquency is not due to
15 negligence or intentional disregard of the provisions of this section, then
16 the entire balance of the annual registration fee, including the delinquent
17 quarterly installment, plus a penalty in a sum equal to 10% of the annual
18 registration fee, shall become due and payable; and. Any such owner so
19 delinquent may thereafter be denied the privilege of the payment of annual
20 registration fees on any vehicle on a quarterly basis. All such fees and
21 penalties remaining unpaid shall constitute a debt due the state, which may
22 be collected from the person owing the same such unpaid fees and
23 penalties by suit or otherwise. All such fees and any penalties remaining
24 unpaid after the same such fees and any penalties are due and payable and
25 any penalties shall constitute a first and prior lien in favor of the state upon
26 the truck or truck tractor registered hereunder under this section, and all
27 other real and personal property of the owner located within the state in the
28 amount such fees and penalties remain unpaid. Each lien shall attach at the
29 time such unpaid fees and penalties accrue and shall be paramount to all
30 prior liens or encumbrances of any character and to the rights of any
31 holder of the legal title in or to any such truck or truck tractor.
32 (2) When a quarterly installment is delinquent more than 10 days
33 beyond the due date, upon default of such installment payment, the county
34 treasurer shall promptly file a notice of lien in the office of the register of
35 deeds of the county where the registration fee is payable, and in any other
36 county in which such owner has any property. A copy of such notice of
37 lien shall be mailed to the division of vehicles, and the owner so
38 delinquent, and the sheriff of any county in which such notice of lien is
39 filed. Such notice of lien shall set forth the name and address of the owner,
40 the amount of fees and penalties payable and unpaid, and the description
41 of the vehicle or vehicles to which applicable to such notice of lien. It shall
42 be the duty of each register of deeds in this state to index and file
43 immediately all such notices of lien in the manner provided in cases of
HB 2122 3
1 financing statements and no fee shall be charged for filing and indexing.
2 (3) The county treasurer shall issue a release of lien upon payment of
3 all fees and penalties payable by such owner and such person may file the
4 same with the register of deeds of any county in which such notice of lien
5 has been filed. The county treasurer shall mail a copy of the release of lien
6 to the division, and to the sheriff of any county where said such notice of
7 lien has been filed.
8 (4) If a quarterly installment payment shall be delinquent more than
9 10 days beyond the due date of such quarterly installment, the division,
10 shall promptly on such default and the filing of the notice of lien issue a
11 tax warrant to the sheriff of any county in which such notice of lien has
12 been filed and may thereafter issue further warrants as may be necessary,
13 and. Such sheriff shall seize and hold all personal property subject thereto
14 to such lien and proceed to advertise and sell the same such property or so
15 much thereof as may be necessary, to satisfy the state's lien, together with
16 all expense of selling at public sale for cash, upon such notice as is
17 provided by law in the case of a security agreement sale.
18 (5) Any surplus of the proceeds of such sale, after paying to the
19 county treasurer, the amount of the state's lien, and the cost of the officer
20 in giving notice of and executing said such warrant computed to the same
21 extent as in judicial sales on execution, and of securing and preserving the
22 property pending such sale, shall be delivered to the person lawfully
23 entitled thereto to such surplus amount. In the event that any truck or truck
24 tractor for which the annual registration fee is being paid quarterly shall be
25 sold or otherwise disposed of, the entire balance remaining unpaid on such
26 annual registration fee shall become immediately due and payable.
27 (6) No certificate of title shall be assigned or transferred or new
28 certificate of title be issued for such vehicle until all the registration fees
29 and penalties are paid in full. In the event such vehicle shall be
30 repossessed by the enforcement of a lien or security interest on the same
31 such vehicle, during any quarterly period for which the registration fees
32 have not been paid, the person repossessing such vehicle or the person
33 purchasing such vehicle at a repossession sale, may acquire a new
34 certificate of title upon the payment of a fee equal to 1/ of the annual
4
35 registration fee of the vehicle registered hereunder under this section, plus
36 the regular fee prescribed by law for certificate of title. If any truck or
37 truck tractor which that is registered under the provisions of this
38 subsection section is exchanged or traded by the owner thereof for another
39 truck or truck tractor, any registration fee and any quarterly installments
40 which that have been paid shall be applied to the registration fee due for
41 the registration of the newly acquired vehicle. The application of any such
42 registration fee or quarterly installment to the newly acquired vehicle shall
43 not affect or reduce the original amount of the annual registration fee or
HB 2122 4
1 any quarterly installment payment, for which such owner was originally
2 liable.
3 (e) The division of vehicles may call to its aid the state highway
4 patrol or any peace officer or any duly appointed representative of the
5 department to enforce the provisions of this section within their respective
6 jurisdiction and it shall be the duty of such officers to do so. The remedies
7 for enforcement and collection provided in this section are cumulative and
8 the use of one shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to use any
9 other.
10 Sec. 2. K.S.A. 8-143a is hereby repealed.
11 Sec. 3. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its
12 publication in the statute book.
